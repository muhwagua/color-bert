      Well, today was the last day of classes. You get that good feeling that you're done, but that awful feeling that exams are only two days away. And that awful head and stomach ache that's left over from yesterday's experience with the flu. While sick on the couch i did get to watch a lot of bad daytime TV. I never realised how long spelling bees are. Or that they have the national "bee" on ESPN. Nice winning word though, Prospicience, i coulda spelled that. Some pretty tough ones too. I'm pretty sure most of them don't exist in English but they assure me that Soavamente (if that is how you spell it) is in the Webster's complete edition (a 13 pound book!). But enough of that. The year is almost over but it still isn't summer yet... I wish the weather would get better. It's too damn cold for may, tommorrow is JUNE!!!! There's the bell... better get to class. seeya

      Good day to you, I was very glad to see today that Mr. Art Eggleton was fired from his position as Defence Minister. The Toronto Sun said it best with this headline "Eggs Fried". Let's face it the man was incompetent and a scam artist. He paid his girlfriend like 16 grand to write a report on why soldiers in war experience stress. Maybe he should have been the minister of TOTAL F#CKING OBVIOUSNESS! Good riddance. Another crack in the Liberal Party... excellent. My guess is that they won't win the next election. At least not with Crouton at the helm. Assembly today was pretty funny we all arrived in Laidlaw hall to find cheap porno magazines strewn about the pews, the leaving class prank no doubt. Some funny reactions include Briglio apologising for 'taking away your magazines, boys.' but then explaining that they were going to 'Mr. Miller's private collection'. And Blakey telling George Lace to give his 'magazine' to Mr. McKay, even though he didn't have one. And when smckell got up to do his badminton presentation he didn't mention the word badminton... until he started naming players I had no idea what he was talking about. I loved how Blakey was like "yes...  badminton  is an excellent sport" afterwards. Ah McKell, what crazy sherbrooke tricks have you yet to pull from up your sleeves... Well thats all for the day. Have a nice week!

      What up G's? I know I haven't been posting to this thingy lately but I'm busy okay. No one reads it anyways. I was at Ontario Model Parliament the last two days. Good stuff going on there. Looked good for the PC party when we agreed witht the NDP to vote down the liberals on their age of majority bill. But then we were totally  shafted  by the Liberals and NDP who seemed to have made an alliance on the next two bills and the budget... so that was bad. Not to mention they block voted against my private members bill proposing jail time for skateboarding anywhere but in a skatepark... damn skaters. Will voted against it and he was in  my  party. If you see will hiss at him. rrrrgh. But I did follow tradition and say "jibba jabba" once again in the house. Didn't seem as big a deal. Oh, and Jack Morawetz is the man. Twice the man I am, I might add. As a seat filler, when no Sr. MPP wanted to speak, Jack spoke and with a vengeance, on more than one occasion. He was rash blunt, and didn't apologise. Everyone should strive to be like Jack. That's my personal insight for the day.

      YEAH!!! GO LEAFS GO!!!!! That was a sweet win. 3-0 for us! Bring on the Hurricanes. I seriously think we can get to the Stanley Cup Finals now. Go Leafs! After the game my dad, and my brother and I went driving up and down Yonge Street with our leafs flags and jerseys and whatnot. It really was a blast. It's like being some kind of celebrity. Everyone is cheering you on as you drive by. It's like being on top of the world! The traffic was so bad that we couldnt even get to Yonge and Eglinton! But definitely fun stuff. We had our fist WAC programs and exec meeting. Some pretty good ideas for themes came up. The Environment, Democracy?, and Globalization being the best. Wac looks like it'll be pretty good this year. So come out! Farouk sez "Go to my crappy website on Bluenet called Blueline to bet on the nhl playoffs cause I'm a retard at blueline.com" so... listen to Farouk. horkypoo out

      TIGJAM and I seem to disagree on the whole Blowback thing so he says he'll write a review for Blowback and I'll put it here on my site to balance the force. So uh... watch for it. Him and I tried to put aside our differences and draft the nominees for the 1st annual UTGA Tony Awards and we did. So it's cool.  GO LEAFS GO. We really pulled out a tight win there. Boy I hope we can win the series and show everyone who hates Toronto that we are a good city with cool people that are sick of everyone bashing us! Go get 'em leafs!

      Blowback was amazing. It was so good. If you have time, go see it tonight. If you don't you're really missing something. You can read my review in the writing section. I also put up my latest blue page rant. It's official. NHL referees suck major ass. Did you see what happened to Tucker? And they did nothing and let the guy score. Probably the most important game of the season for the Leafs and the Sens win on a cheap goal. Well... leafs in seven. I hope...

      LEAFS WON!!!!!!!!!!! Whoohoo! (as you can see, I'm happy! :) ) Now that the series is tied up 2-2 we take it back home for two games with home ice advantage. Hopefully, we can pull out two victories. What did I tell you all? Leafs in six, baby! Sens are going down. Ottawa sucks! Yeah!

      I put up some pics of me from the play I was in, the UCC/BSS Young Company production of Tina Howe's "Museum" that is. You can see me in my Duct Tape gear with the Canada Cartage hat, and the essential lumberjack jacket, and see if I really look like the guy from Barenaked Ladies, like Alex Hood (voice of Arthur's "The Brain"!!!) among others told me. I got the pics from Wai's site. I also put up the random section for stuff that's well... random. Now I only have my infamous cheetoh scam (take that Frito-Lay!). After a whole day of being up my site has it's first critiques Matt Cowie says "It sucks! I'm just kidding, it's good." and Jeff Hume says the URL is "interesting..." well, it's not exactly gold but hell... no one comes here anyways

      If the last thing I wrote wasn't enough geo propaganda, I'm making this one from Geo Class! Live from Geo class... it's me. And the day after a field trip we get an hour off class, after watching a slide show of yesterday's trip. Geo Rules!

      I am reminded why I love Geo today... if full day caving field trips aren't an excuse to get really dirty (which they are) then they're an excuse to miss school. Which is why Geo rules and everyone who doesn't take Geo is dumb for thinking it's just a slacker course. And we're going on another Geo trip later this week. There's my little plug for today. Geo. Lots of field trips. Take it.

      Hey there! I'm Chris, but one of my better nicknames is Horkypoo, and this is my website. Not only is this the home of my ramblings and scribbles, it's also uh... something else yet to be thought of. I'm just your average Canadian kid, who's passions include politics and the theatre. I consider myself somewhat of an amateur humorist and journalist. I'm also the only guy to ever ask Ian Urquhart what his "most favouritest moment about being a journalist" was, and the only one to "jibba jabba" in the Ontario legislature. Well that's about it... have fun and GO LEAFS GO!!!!!

      After really sucking for two whole days at the tournament, I went out and played today and found that when not under so much pressure I play a lot better. Although my game needs some work...  I did end up seeing Star Wars yesterday. I must say although I wouldn't call it a bad film, I was a tad dissappointed. I was rather underwhelmed with Hayden Christensen as Anakin. I couldn't see him as being the same person as little Anakin from Phantom. Maybe it was the script but he just came of as a big crybaby. And what's with Padme looking exactly like she did 10 years ago but Anakin looks totally different? I really enjoyed Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan. He managed to retain the Obi-Wan character from Phantom and add enough of the Alec Guinness Obi-Wan from the first trilogy to make it seem like he really had made that transition from student to master. Jar Jar's part was greatly reduced to many loud cheers. I didn't really mind Jar Jar, though. I found he had a certain charm to him, but I think his part is quite sufficient in this film. But what about Qui-Gon? Aside from a small mention he is all but forgotten? Jedi don't just die like that! They come back as ghosts! One ghost scene would have been cool. And Dooku isn't nearly as cool as Darth Maul. And Mace Windu sounds so lame saying "This party's over!" But enough complaining. It's all worth it for the scene where Yoda and Dooku square off in a lightsaber duel. Oh yeah... YODA! I give it thumbs up just for yoda... I'll be going to camp on friday so this will be probably the last post for a while. PEACE!!!!

      School is  over !!!! To tell the truth it's been over for quite some time now... my work ethic has gone to heck so I haven't posted much. I'm having trouble typing because I've gone so long without doing it. I need help! Summer is getting off to a good start. I got to play two great golf courses recently. Angus Glen's challenging North Course was home to this year's Hamish Simpson Classic, a small, well organised tournament for UCC class of 2004 guys and Cherry Downs the home course of my extended family out in Markham. Both beautiful courses and tough too. I'm playing pretty well, shaping up for this weekend's Jr. Club Championship over at my home course: the one and only Rosedale G.C. By shaping up I mean I'm practicing at golf camp this week. The highlight of which is always lunch (mmmm... PLT)! Enough about golf. I'm hoping to finally see Star Wars before the week is through, or at the very least before I head off to camp. I gotta see this yoda thing...

      Exams are going pretty well. I've already written German, French, English, and Chemistry all of which went pretty well... Chem wasn't great but whatever. I saw a really good movie yesterday: Insomnia. It was a really good film. Pacino is definitely a great actor, Robin Williams wasn't bad either, Hilary Swank was good. Usually I detest these movies were the whole damn cast is Oscar winning so they can flaunt that on the previews  > pay it forward  > but this one is really good. Great murder mystery, even if you don't like that stuff! A pleasant surprise. And I wasn't constantly reminded of Ms. Doubtfire or Mork and Mindy... Insomnia... thumbs up!

      Exams begin tommorrow and I really should be studying... But I thought I'd drop a line here on the old blog. I saw Sum of All Fears on Friday, good film. I especially liked the appearance (albeit brief) of my favourite Canadian actor: the one and only Colm Feore. I don't know why Cowie and I always see Ben Affleck films... well it was just this and Changing Lanes so you can all forgive us. Estey was there too. It was actually his idea to see it. Good pick! They blow up Baltimore! On Saturday I singlehandedly won the chipping contest at Rosedale morning clinics for my team... take that you twelve year old punks! And in the afternoon played nine holes with Cowie, upon his dad's strong suggestion that we play. ("horkmeisterrrrrr!!!!") Fun times, fun times. And the summer is officially here. Really warmed up! :)

      I just got back today from camp. And I just realise how much I love being up there even more coming back home. I mean home is great but camp is just such a nice place to be with lots of friends and stuff to do. No muskats down here though, which is nice. Hopefully they'll ask me to come back next year to be a counselour in training seeing as it was my last year as a camper. I just can't see myself never going back there. My parents got my brother a basketball net while we were gone. It's pretty nice. I'm enjoying the use I get out of the ball I bought like 4 years ago. Summer is half over now... scariness. I really don't care though because I like going to school. Which is what I was saying last summer until school started. Anyways some of the younger guys at camp are UCC guys coming to the upper school. They assure me that I got the most empty headed guy as my grade 8 buddy. Joy. Well that's about it. See ya'll soon.

      Summer is just flyin' by. Before long I'll be back in school. I don't know whether I want school to come or not. I'll go with not for now. I finally saw Spider-Man. (Had to go out to the huge alien spaceship theatre in the boonies to find a place where they still showed it). I gotta say it was good. I liked it better than Star Wars. Austin Powers 3 is still the best movie so far of the summer.  Goin' down south to Vegas, then LA to visit family and see the sights. Gonna be sweet. Probably won't post til after. PEACE

      You'd think that a month's abscense isn't enough to miss much but a quick popover to  urlLink Apple.com  and it seems pretty much everything has been upgraded to a new version. I decided that with my slowpoke connection it's really not worth it to download iTunes 3 but that OSX 10.2 Jaguar looks hella-cool. On the downside, they've gotten rid of iTools and with it goes my mac.com email. I've got until Sept. 30th to pay up for the new .Mac service or lose my email. Sha, right! Movin' to hotmail...  I also saw Wayne's World on CityTV. Man that movie rules. Party on!

      I've been back to school for a week now... and as unwilling as I was to go back, I am now coming to grips with my reality. As for the teacher situation I've got Mr. Wayne Tompkins for English, this guy is like the English guru... He's read just about anything you can name and I think he's old enough to have met Ernest Hemmingway, great guy really. For Geo, "Papa" Neil Mens, the Mensilator, a real cheerful guy, not as techno savvy as Hoel, and I'm kinda sad I don't get to use Hoel's new GeoNArc'ed out classroom but he's really a great teacher and we get to go to NYC this year, sweeeet. In the Theatre department, which btw is the greatest class ever in the history of classes, I've got Richard "Rick" Hood, who is also my house advisor, a really cool dude who even wrote a great play called Blowback (you can a review I wrote in my writing journal on this site). For French, sadly no Briglio (heyhey bubu!) but I've got Mme. Lowndes who I must say is very funny when she makes fun of the weaker french students... and they don't even understand. Math, good things can't last forever and neither can Shawzee but this year we've got a bigger class and a teacher called Griffin, really nice guy... kinda weird though, he made up his own number system where 11 is pronounced "10-dee one".... right. Finally Systems is good ol' Premek Hamr, the craziest crawfish-lovin' Czech you'll ever meet. He saved an endangered fish in Australia too! Good teachers anyways.  Played some Golf today with the Cowie-man. He played well, and I well... I've had better. But Rosedale is pretty mutilated. The 1st and 18th are under construction so you start on ten go to 17 then play 2 to 9 and 10 and 11 again... and the rest of the course is aerated to heck. Not good green conditions. Well I can see I've rambled long enough so this is where I say till next time!

      I had my first real rehearsal for Working today. It was one on one with Angie about my monologue. We worked on it a lot. She wanted me to stay for Ben's one and be a dog or something but then she changed her mind... which was good I guess. I think this is really gonna be a great play. It's got all the makings of a sweet show. I heard second hand that it was a huge flop on Broadway but hey, this is a grassroots deal, on Broadway they made it way too extravagant. We'll do it justice, just you wait. The first and second battle in winning this Halloween writing contest thang have been won. Antony said he liked my story, and he's running the contest, so yes that is a very good thing. Ben Sinclair didn't enter, so I've already achieved my goal of beating him this year... I went to the village Second Cup on my spare today with Bateman and Will. Had their new Vanilla deal cause they make it cheap on tuesday. Yeah it was good and I really have nothing else to talk about so yeah... Fresh Outs!

      We had our read through for the musical "Working" today. It was good. I got to hear all the songs and finally read the script! I have an additional monologue with the one that we read for callbacks and I show up a couple other times with some small lines. For this play, that's a pretty good non-solo singing part. And thank goodness I don't have to solo! I'll let old Rich Ly and Clifford have that thank you very much. We also are trying to start our own Theater publication I got everything together me and Cowie will be the head editors and we have a lot of other people interested. We got Hood to agree to being faculty advisor. We went to Lorne Young and he thinks there might be too many publications and we should try to be part of Convergence! Just his suggestion, he says he'll talk to Arkin. But I think we'll end up getting a page of our own. 1) we don't like (most of) the Convergence people 2) they don't like us 3) we want it this way or we go rogue and do it anyways. Anyways, we're seeing a play tomorrow nite for ToK. Should be... interesting. No doubt I'll review it or something. And also, I should put up some more of my Blue Page stuff here... I really should. If I wasn't so lazy I would.  HOLLA! I'm out.

      As this weekend comes to a close I have to say that it really came out of nowhere to be like one of the best ones this year! It was just like last minute spontaeneous decisions to go see a movie with Cowie and then to go to this WAC Party (I gotta say it was one of the best sausage fests I've been to). It was just a sweet weekend one which both friday and saturday I was not sleeping until after 12:00. And if you see Panos laugh at him... he probably won't remember why.

I spent the afternoon with Bateman, George and Will filming funny stuff down at Yonge and Eglinton. The broom gag, What should I name my monkey?, and riding on toys r us horsies will soon be SNL classics.  I got this CD "Run DMC- Greatest Hits". Finally a rap cd that isn't eminem in my collection. I basically was just listening to random sample songs at Edward's (great store by the way) and I had to buy this one. Great CD. You will buy it now. Along with Forty Licks. You will buy both of them.  MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM TURKEY -out

      to Brooker and Hudson: Big Ups! Cause you asked for it. Yo! I was an editor today for the bluepage. Since Cowie and Curtis had rehearsal and Rotchtin had like surgery or something I got to do most of the editing! Danzel helped cause I didn't really know how to work the software. But I really made everything fit and stuff. I think I did a good job. And I got free dinner! Free thanksgiving dinner! Sooooo goood. But anyways... the Blue Page is pretty good this week with four features. A John Spence article, rather controversial. I didn't really agree but hey, that's the point. There was a really beautifully written soccer article from Mr. Turner. And a poetic masterpeice from the ever eloquent Wayne Tompkins "the great". I hope he likes how I put it in. I tried not to change anything but I hope I didn't miss anything typing it in. He is my English teacher. Great guy really.  I'm listening to the new Rolling Stones CD forty licks. It rules. You will all buy it now. Survivor is on tonite. That chick got raped in the last episode... tension man. tense. way tense.

      A lazy fall Saturday indeed. Played golf with Cowie. We both played wonderfully miserable. Had fun all the same. We talked a lot about how UCC Theatre season is officially "in". With Working being cast as we speak and Richard II doing rehearsals or something now it's definitely underway. Expect good things from these plays. Good things indeed. This has been getting some strange cult popularity around school. I guess it's a good thing Wai's site is way better to laugh at than mine.  I haven't lost faith in this Gamecube of mine. Mario Sunshine... kickass game. Definitely a classic. This weeks  urlLink PA  is good. Check it out. good for a laugh. That's it for now. PEACE!

      It's amazing how for almost a whole term school can seem so easy with little or no work, only to start being overloaded constantly with work and extracurricular committments (which I love to death, but I seriously have too many).Yeah with big projects from all angles, my three publications (BluePage, Convergence, Quiddity), the play (we really havent had anything for a while though...), Improv team (affectionately known as the "team team"), and being manager for 1st B-ball (which is pretty cool), I'm a busy guy. I haven't gone home at 3:30 all week. I'm seeing this Young Co. Play tonite. I might write a review pending my mood. I usually do when I see a play.  My birthday is coming up! Dec. 18... it's like a preview Christmas! But that also means exams are coming up which is waaaay not as cool as my birthday. I got 100% on my math test... ah studies. YAY! Have a sweet day peeps. I'm out. CH

      Cowie's surprise party... it was sweet. We had him fooled all week long thinking we were going to see Harry Potter 2! He wasn't very quick to catch on even when Bateman pulls up in the LIMO! "Nice car..." he says. We went to Gretzky's for some dinner. Baby back ribs... mmmmm. And then to Yuk Yuk's for a little entertainment. The comics there were f---ing hilarious! We laughed our asses off. Then we cruised for a bit in the Limo, went back to Cowie's house. Went to the village for an evening coffee and back to matt's house to watch Henry V which turned into playing XBOX. By the time I was home it was 1:00 AM... a fun evening indeed.

      Okay so get this... Derrick (the world's "greatest" stage manager) is telling me all week we have an all cast rehearsal tonight. And Ms. Foran says that too. And then I get there with like half the cast and it's apparrently cancelled. And apparrently "stage management" was supposed to send us an email. So I stayed til 5 for nothing. I ended up waiting for my 6 oclock ride home and doin some hw. But I mean, we have FIVE f%cking stage managers and one of them couldn't send an email saying "it's cancelled". Man, I saw a part of a Richard II rehearsal and they are sooo much more organised and better. They have one director and one SM. We have like 10 of each and nothing gets done... but it's cool cause I had HO-LEE-CHOW for dinner, and I'll be hungry in an hour... ice cream. Hudson... shout outs... I will find a way to make you pay for these cause you're getting too many free ones lately. I am soooo OUT! But it's all g

      Much to my surprise today was an afternoon focus day... seeing as I had Guitar lessons today, I had to hang around school, then head down to Snider's. So I had a coffee (courtesy of Bateman) at the village with Will and Bateman. And then I used my spare time to write what Cowie said was one of my best Blue Page articles yet. I hope it gets printed this week. I put some thought into it. I haven't written in a while so I wanted to have something this week.  NO SCHOOL ON FRIDAY (BLING) CH is out

      Saw a movie last night called "Igby Goes Down". It was an indie film. I used to hate those so much but I'm more cultured these days. I'm really glad that Will dragged us out to see it cause I probably wouldn't have seen it any other way. I really enjoyed it. It was funny, insightful, and interesting. Two thumbs up. Halloween came and went. I was volounteering down at the Gerrard K Club. They run a really good haunted house for the kids down there. Some kids were hella scared. It was our House Outreach. I hope I get a couple hours out of it... I needs em!  Have a nice weekend!

      Better give an Xmas update... and a b-day one too... yikes! Well I've been busy playing with my new stuff to post, and besides, I reiterate, who am I letting down? The like 2 people that read this? Anyways, I'm busy playing with the  coolest thing ever , my new  urlLink iPod ! This thing is sweet, I've never really had an MP3 player before, but I can safely say this is probably the best one in existence. I also have cool new GameBoy Advance and I got the game Yoshi's Island, and I went out and picked up A Link to the Past with some of the Xmas money I got. Definitely a sweet item. It's like SNES, but portable, and better! I got Metroid Prime which is a sweet game (game of the year according to  urlLink GameSpot ) but it's hella-hard... and I'm just on the first part, still a great game. Tiger Woods 2003 and NHL 2003 are also now in my GCN library now... both really good games! I got a nice new CD Holder with my name on it. My bro got me Big Shiny Tunes 7 (which is probably the best compilation the series has put together so far). And some other really cool stuff I can't remember... I took my Xmas money shopping and picked up some new CDs. I had resolved to get some rap CDs since a MuchVibe commercial asked me if I was "representin'" and I realised that I wasn't, so I got this new Nelly CD "Nellyville" and the soundtrack off 8 Mile which I ripped off my bro (heheh...) Both are definitely good CDs, I'd reccomend them to anyone looking for some ghetoo beats! :-) I just used a smiley which freaks me out so I'm just gonna stop here.

      Happy Birthday to me! Yes, that's right, it's my birthday... and I'm sick as a dog :( So right, happy 16th birthday to me, but that doesn't cure this awful flu... shoulda got the shot. Ah well! I had to go down to school this morning to get my stuff out of my locker, they're gonna fumigate the place, kill the RATS! I gotta get a driver's license!  With so much stuck at home sick time, I've been hangin out at this  urlLink forum  that Justin Wu set up. And truthfully it's pretty enjoyable! You should go hang out there... It's really well set up.  ... wonder what I'm gonna get for my birthday? I'll keep ya posted. Outness!

      I saw Branagh's new movie last night: Rabbit Proof Fence. I have to say his performance was phenomenal as usual. The rest of the movie was also very powerful. I thought it was moving and that the director did a very good job of creating symbols of power and conveying emotion without words. There were parts were a word wouldn't be uttered for several minutes on end, and these were some of the most emotional moments. I was especially impressed by the aboriginal actor who played the tracker, Moodoo. He said only one brief phrase that quite frankly I didn't understand what he said, but he carried himself with such a presence. It was like he was stone cold but you could see deep down that he had inner conflict. His air of seriousness was just amplified by his stone cold facial expression (I say expression because it rarely changed). The girls who played the runaways were very good considering it was their first time acting. The one thing that got me was how they would always run into these random people in the desert that gave them food and showed them directions. But hey, it's a true story. Really makes you think the kind of cruelty that went on in the world and hardly anyone knows about it. We had to see this movie at Canada Square which is an old skool theatre. No stadium seating, no big comfy chairs, small ass theatre and screen. But it was coo'. Cause it made me feel smarter seeing an intellectual film. HA! That's all.

      3 down 3 to go. I have 2 exams this week. Systems and Theatre. This week is jokes! Possibly to two hackest courses in the school, with plenty of days off in between to prepare. Geo next week then it's break till January! I've been thinking about writing a play... but I realised that I can't for the life of me come up with an idea. If I do I'll let you know. I've been listening to these random CD compilations from the mid to late 90s. I almost forgot about Mase! Mase man! What ever happened to Mase! Bagpipes rule... LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATES!

      Exams start tommorrow. Which is good and bad. Good because it means school is nearly over. Bad because Exams start tommorrow. This week is the worst. I have three straight starting tommorrow: English, French, and Math on wednesday thursday and friday respectively. Next week is chill. Systems, Theatre, and  a whopping 3 days off. Then I have Geo the next monday and I am so out of there for Christmas. Which is also nice because Christmas and what I refer to as "Week Early Christmas" (my birthday) are just around the corner. Sweeeeeet! But wait, I have an exam tommorrow... better study these books. On an unrelated note Titus Andronicus rules and I totally disagree with anyone who would say it was Shakespeare's worst play. Out.

      Yeah I just want to say that if Chris' borther were to start puching the billy often, you can say "Reid do you smoke weed? Cause it rhymes". Our dear friend Flounder here will be going to the Peaks this weekend, and he had better start searching for some skis to get, cause if we are going to go on a ski trip next year, he should probably start thinking of getting some. Anyway this is my first post and I jsut want to keep the randomness factor to its max. Take it easy.

      We had Krispy Kreme Donuts today in house meetings and my joke-a-day calendar had a joke about Krispy Kreme Donuts... freaky.  Jurist kinda gave my a nice set up to run for Head of House next year, that was sweet. Farouk says he would vote for me... At least I'll have that if I go for it! WAC is coming up and I have to say it's shaping up to be way better than last year. I entered a couple dumb names for this auction... So if they call it the "Big Blue Gazoo" you can thank me :-). Is Grease Megamix a great song, or am I out of my freaking mind???

      The last post there, not made by me. A new concept here... I'm trying to experiment with having some other peeps be able to post. Will's on the team now... Yeah, Michael Bolton down there... he's the first guy other than me to post and as you can see he finds blogging pretty "trippy". I also have Cow-Pie and Bat-E-Man coming soon... so watch out for it. WAC is cool because I finally have a speaker for my plenary so if you're going to WAC, then sign up for plenary no. 2 "The Multinational Corporation" because it's the best one... and I'm organising it with Estey "The Big E". The Blue Page is being cancelled or something but we have to apologise or something and it comes back... I don't know the deal but it's rather heinous and unfair as far as I can gather. This Big Chill Motown CD is the sheezy! I'm out.

      I just wanna get one thing straight, it's not Horkypoo... it's Flounder!  Or at least for the time being my new nickname is Flounder (ask Bateman or George...) Rook doesn't really like it, so he can call me whatever, but he doesn't like nicknames, or the name Rook. So anyways, I'm trying Flounder for the next while just to test it out and so far it's coo', it's supposed to be from Animal House or Little Mermaid or something so I have to see the movie.  Extended Essay Week starts tommorrow and although it's being called "Christmas vacation 2" by some, I'm gonna be workin' non stop. I don't know how I'm gonna finish this thing. My rough draft will be VERY rough.  WAC is in like a month, as if I don't need more stress! I have to confirm my speakers.... aaah!  I found a beanie in my basement... hehe beanie.  Working rehearsals are really starting to get goin' and all I can say is I am so not worthy. I am so lucky to have such a great role in this play compared to my acting skills. Well, whatever it's the musical. Pinto is talkin a lot of Henry V for next year's Senior Show, if that's true I am so trying out for Chorus. I just love that opening O for a muse of fire speech... Jacobi rules!  Speaking of Jacobi, I saw Branagh in Harry Potter 2 last night. His part was surprisingly small, I remember Lockhart having a bigger role. But he was good. He portrayed the false arrogance with panache and wit. He was pretty funny too. The whole thing with the portrait and his "magical me" biography deal was great. It's too bad his character leaves the series cause I would have liked to see him in more of these films.  Well, Wankstaz... that's all for now, I'm out! PEACE!

      I'm back at school and I apparently have to tell you about Ian Bateman. Where can I start, this guy is a loyal friend and always there to lend a helping hand. He's knowledgeable about a lot of things, and if you want to buy a new car, a new pair of skis, or a new bike, he could probably help you out without making you look like an idiot. And ladies, he's single so don't hate him because he is or isn't beautiful. Okay, Ian, I never have to mention you on this site ever again now.  I apparrently spelled "ghetto" wrong... I'm sorry I am the whitest guy ever. I'm such a redneck I listen to John Cougar Mellencamp and Blue Rodeo... but honestly it was a typo.  I'm currently writing a musical with Elvis songs, like I don't have enough to keep me busy already. I was going to call it "Return of the King" but then the estate of JRR Tolkien would sue my ass. Even though this is probably the crappiest idea ever, I think it could work.  I got an 89% on my english exam (which would be a 7 but I'm one friggin mark off), and a 90% on French! I just hope my report card is this good.  I'm out.

      Happy New Year all around. 2002 ended last night. And now it's 2003. Doesn't have the same ring to it... 2003... it's like 1993.  At least there was no terrorist activity, we can all be thankful for that. Although, it might be tough to decide who to wage war on next. North Korea, or Iraq. We for sure can't do both and the War on Terrorism... flip a coin I guess. Okay, how about some year in review. The best movie of 2002, in my opinion, was "Austin Powers in Goldmember". The stoopid award goes to former majority leader in the senate, Trent Lott (I'm a republican, and even I think he's a dumbass). And my new iPod wins the award for the coolest thing ever in the world. I worked a bit on my World Lit paper today. And I've been doing some light research endeavours on my Extended Essay... how am I ever going to finish a rough draft for the due date... it's gonna be very rough. I wish I could say I did something really cool over the break like write an epic poem but I just have been really lazy... ah well  That's all I have to say.

      Yeah so I saw (my mentee) DJ's play. Turns out it was a play version of "The Princess Bride". It's hard to screw up such a great story as that so naturally it was entertaining. Pretty funny material right? Sure it might not have been as "professional" as say KR2, but hey this is a grade 7/8 play. It was pretty nostalgic, I remembered my moments from doing the prep musical. Which reminds me, I saw Warren aka Mistah C there and he tells me they're doing "Toad" again for the musical so not only will I be showing up as always, it's gonna be special or something. A photo op at least! Cool...  My Hockey article in the Blue Page didn't go over that well. Some very brave fans said they agreed with me and the Hockey guys, some of them, were kind of indifferent but I actually have been getting a lot of negative criticism lately. Not just for this but for the last one. But hey, I've purposely been being unnecessarily extreme in my opinions lately to stimulate a response, so jokes on them!  I tried out for UCC Idol, and like a typical American Idol contestant, I forgot my words. But they said I was good, and Dr. Hamr said I "looked like South Park"... sweet!  Oh and I found the iPod today... big relief there! Thank you Julie, if you for some wacko reason are reading this!   So which CD should I buy next... -Sean Paul? -Cradle 2 The Grave Soundtrack? -Foo Fighters? The answer would be different depending on whether I ask the Fleming improv team, my brother, or DMX...  Anyways I'm out of crap to talk about so... Take it easy.

      Bateman's right. That site is done by some guys at the school and it is very funny despite it's utter vulgarity. Some of the stuff is really mean though... like the one about Wai. I know who did it but I won't disclose their identity for their own protection.  While I think Ian has a good idea for the next musical, we have to get the title straight. Is it "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" or "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". One is the title of the book (by the great Roald Dahl) and one of the movie. And while this perhaps would make a great play, I think that it still might end up being "Grease", because well... Grease is the word, right?  Bateman, you are cool because you post here unlike Cowie and Will. Actually Will should probably not see this site cause it mentions that other site.... heh.  PEACE

      Yeah because it seems our dear friend Flounder has been neglecting this poor little site (just playin man), I would like to take this opportunity to direct your attention to another site (not as good as this one) that has been getting quite a bit of attention at school recently. Some guys have made a site at (ok here comes the address)  satire.is-a-geek.com/main.html  It is incredibly interesting, and not surprisingly humorous. Now another venue that I wish to bring to your attention is next years musical. Now my associates and myself have had many a brainstorming sessions on this and we feel that the next musical should be...... "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" Huh Huh? You feeling it, you feeling it??? I think that it would be really good if we could do it. Besides the movie version of it had alot of music in it, like the Candyman song (performed by the great Sammy Davis Jr.) not to mention the great 'Oompa Loompa' song (yes the perfect role for Mike Stephens [hahahahaha]). Yeah it would be jokes. Till the next time, stay off the chems, and don't pee your pants. Take it easy.

Anyways about the play... well Jorge was good, and they had this cool dance thing in the middle. I'll leave it at that.

      Isn't being at school on Saturday great? It's like my life revolves around this place now. Makes you wonder what I'm gonna do when I graduate from this place.   I was at a play rehearsal today in the morning. It's starting to get religious, cause you know it's only like two months away now right? And then there was an improv training session with Julie who is just great. She really helped us and I think we'll be ready for competition next week with all this practice. Are we going to the nationals? No chance in hell. Are we at least gonna get into the zone finals? Conceivably, yes.  Seeing this my big fat "Blood Wedding" play tonite with Rook (by the book). I'll follow up on that afterwards to say how it was. It should be good, I mean it has Jorge in it!   God, I'm hungry... I'm gonna go eat something now.  PEACE

      Alright, hopefully this is working now...   Working  is coming along nicely now. We started rehearsing in the theatre and it's coming together. It's starting to look like a play. This seriously will be a good show. Like, better than KR2 good? Maybe... it's kinda like apples and oranges, or more like apples and Howie D from the Backstreet Boys.  (Check this segway out...) Speaking of the Backstreet Boys, this UCC Idol thing. Definitely gonna give it the old college try, I mean that photo shoot and autograph session that would be jokes! So anyways, doing some boy band research right now listening to  Millenium . Yes, that's right, I found a BSB album in my house and I am now listening to it. I mean this was like the golden age of pop music. Before all that O-Town crap came along.  But hey, I won't betray my uh... urban roots. Or my latest rap binge, I should really say. By the way, 50 Cent is getting huge now... see? Who told you? Who liked Wanksta the first time BET played it? I'll end now with a quote from  Back Down .  "Yeah! G-G-G-G  G-Unit!  ( g-unit )"-back down

      Okay, so I lost in this NHL 99 Tournament to some random chinese guy I've never seen before... I officially suck. But my tournament career isn't over, that's right, this Rock Paper Scissors tournament, I'm goin' all the way. Nothing beats rock, good old rock. I saw KR2 on Friday (hey other people on this blog, feel free to comment on it). And I gotta say, wow! Was it ever good! I mean, this is a play with pretty much no set, props, or special effects, so it's basically riding solely on the acting, and it was so good! Cowie, you were great man, I know I already told you, and it's not because you're my friend, you were the best one. Will was really good too, he played the conflicted Duke of York very tactfully. And B-to-the-man-dot was also good for such a small role. The fight scene was sooo cool. The sword came like this close [making gesture with hands to show how close the sword came]!!!! The show deserved every second of my standing ovation, and the rest of the audience ought to be ashamed that they didn't follow my example.  So... uh, Working, yeah hey I'm also in a play. We now get the theatre, which is good. The show is starting to come together. The songs are great. I think everyone will enjoy it. Improv. We near the competition date as each day passes. I just hope we can beat the scaaaary dragon that needs a blender.  WAC is over and planning for WAC2004 starts now. Apparrently the branksome peeps have already assigned positions... that's just WACk... get it!? WAC... wack? Homonyms! Anyways, I'm personally vying for something that ends in "chair", but I might have to settle for something more like :"Head of Moderators... chair". 50 cent's "If I Can't" is a sweet song!  -Flounder out.

      Being sick sucks... Especially on a weekend, and especially when WAC is coming up soon. We lost to Appleby today in B-ball. Which is depressing when they lost to us really badly earlier in the season. They've gotten better. Definitely. I got the new 50 Cent CD. And while I still think that his best song is Wanksta, tracks like In Da Club, and Many Men are definitely bounceworthy. I also got CLIPSE's Lord Willin' while I was at it. And these guys really can rhyme, you don't see that often these days in rappers. Combine that with the beats of the Neptunes and you get some awesome tracks. Grindin', Ma I Don't Love Her, and When the Last Time, are worth the purchase alone. Also both of those albums comes with a DVD, a trend I could get used to! Anyways that's enough for now. Peace.

       Snatch , the latest flick from British director and Maddona husband Guy Ritchie, is the tale boxing promoters Turkish and Tommy who through a series of twisting and intricated plot structures become entangled in a squabble over an 84 carat diamond stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benny Del Toro), that involves several "gangs", if you will, of the sleazy British underworld.   The ensemble cast of actors you probably have never heard of (minus probably Brad Pitt) ably portrays the extremely stereotypical Jewish, Black, Pikey, and Russian gangs. Whether it's the incoherent babble of the Pikeys (think British hicks), or the hilarious incompetence of the blacks at robbery,  Snatch  keeps you laughing. And at the same time you become wrapped in the very complicated plot which is surprisingly easy to follow. Some very cleverly edited sequences, the car crash, the final boxing match, polish off what is a very funny and captivating film.   Snatch  has earned it's place among classic films such as  Beavis and Butthead Do America  and  Zoolander  on my official "Greatest Movies of All Time List" which I will post here some day.

      Ian the deal is this: If you are a big enough "Dave" fan to skip school and get the tickets then you have earned the right to be big enough of a "Dave" fan to see "Dave" in concert at the amplitheatre. But the real question is this: Is it  amplitheatre  or  ampitheatre , or furthermore could it be the  amphitheatre ! Spelling!  I am currently ripping the Fugees album, "The Score" borrowed off George Lace (big ups). It rules. I also have on loan the sketchy Japanese DVD of "Snatch" (a movie many have insisted I see immediately) which I plan to view tommorry. Expect a verdict later.  It's now official: Horkins/"Pooh Bear" for Head Steward. So any IB1 who doesn't have strong attachments to any certain candidate, it's time to rock the vote! It's a celebration of democracy so go out and cast your vote for your favourite candidate (and consider throwin' me a vote while you're at it).  BluePage-esque rant follows: They fired Marrouchi! What fucking bullshit. I mean honestly if Ms. Robertson can justify firing a teacher who most of the students  love  (in a platonic sense) by claiming he didn't follow all IB regulations how can she justify renewing the contract of one Michael "The NArkin" Arkin, who almost none of the student body like, actually most of the leaving class decided not to give money to the leaving class gift after his contract was renewed, personally I can't stand the man what fucking asshole, he fucked up all the IB marks for Higher Comp Sci that year and guess what? His very good "friend" Ms. Robertson renews his contract. That's not hypocritical is it? And this is our next fucking principal, I'm glad I won't be here.  On a happier note: Working, the musical, is next week (aaaaaah!) so see it. There was some talk backstage of next year's musical so I will finish with a list of ones that came up: -Les Miserables -The Sound of Music  -Grease -Grease 2 -Hair -Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory -The Lion King -The Lion King 2 -Rent -Rent 2 ("Where is the rent?") -Quadriphenia (okay so this was bateman at a different time but... yeah) -Chicago -The Producers -Burning Love (the yet to be written broadway smash featuring classic songs from Elvis Presley, the king himself!!!.... okay so this is my musical idea that I haven't wrote yet...)

      Once again our dear friend Flounder has left his beloved and much frequented (by Alex Bishop) site in the lurch. (Just playing man) While we are still more or less on the topic of Mr. Bishop it appears that he doesn't like me posting on the site, well I can post, so you will list to every goddamn word I have to say. In other news Dave* tickets are going on sale Monday for the Amplitheatre. This sucks why do we have to be in school when the Dave tickets are on sale, they will all be gone by the time we have an opportunity to get down there, also Coldplay is playing at the Ampitheatre on June 11th (the day we get out of school) and tickets are sold out! I must say that I am disappointed that once again our beloved school has let us down, preventing us from aquiring tickets as they come on sale during school time. The thing that really pisses me off about these concerts is that they are at the Amplitheatre! The best place for a concert! Whether it is Chris Rickets working the beer stand and giving you beer without the need for ID or the copious amounts of Marijuana that are consumed without a care. Yes it truly does suck to have to go to school. *(Dave Matthews Band)

      March break is coming to an end and I see I haven't posted for quite some time.  During most of the last week of school before the break I was very ill. Which sucks to say the least. It's a good thing I got better in time for the Europe trip I went on over the first week. It was sweet. It was the battlefields trip originally organised by Ms. Ridout but then handed over to Mr. McDonald, henceforth and forever to be referred to as McG, and/or Greggo. Anyways, it was good times. But now I'm totally jet lagged.  So here's the dillyo peeps: I'll post next during the first week of school, if you need more flounderness before then, I urge you to get one of the other skids to post for you.  Oh yeah, and it seems they're bombing Iraq now. Let's hope they finish this quickly so we can enjoy the spoils hmmm?   Peace out.

      Well someone is apparently sick *cough*Horkins*cough* and missed theatre class so we weren't able to perform today. And people are pissed cause they brought all of their things today, but I guess we can't blame Flounder we never plan to be sick (well we do, at least I do) but some warning would have been nice, but whatever.  Flounder missed the big event at school today, I am referring to none other than the House Hockey Final which occured between Jacksons and Mowbrays (or Blowbrays as it is sometimes referred to [by people much bigger than me (ie. Horkins)]) anyway it was an intense and closely contested game which saw both teams take the lead. However the golden house of Jacksons rallied from their 2-1 deficet after falling behind, and scored two quick goals, and never looked back taking the win 5-2. Thus winning the house hockey championship. Jacksons, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah! JACKSONS!...

It is sweeet. Uncle Al is the coolest!  March break is like, 4 days away now. I just can't wait because I am so sick and tired of working all day and night... I am just exhausted.  So I'm going to sleep now.

      First of all, everyone who says that the scale was messed up is right! But guess who came up with the scale? Non-other than Nescafe Frothy aka Ricci aka Rolo (props to Spence for the Nescafe name). Of course the water bottle was messed up! Nescafe came up with that scale on the spot! He didn't talk to either Flounder or myself in how the model should be built, having giving him the dimensions of the New Theatre, he then turns around and 'designs' the model after i've already started building it, so thus i have to scrap the entire thing. And while flounder admitts that he made some mistakes, as i did aswell, Flounder actually tried really hard to correct them. But when the wind blows high, Ducks fly together! And when your lost and you can't find your way home, Ducks fly together! And when the 300 pound UVM hockey great (who doesn't look an emaciated Kenyan runner) Steve McKell is barrelling down on you in the corner, Ducks fly together! But when someone 'designs' a messed up scale without consulting the rest of the group, and forces their tentative model to be scrapped, well that just makes you a tool.  GO DUCKS GO  And yes Bishop, Cowie's mom is a realestate agent.

      Yo peeps.  OK, Spin, you never shut up about this clone high so it must be like camping (intense). It's too bad that my mom is a tv nazi and we only have basic, basic cable. So WT is all hating on me lately. He is not giving me such great marks and seems to not give me the sugar in the halls that i have become acustomed to. I have said before to many people that quite possibly the worst feeling in the world would be to make WT cry. It would be such a sad, sad occurence. Well $JT$ I find is lovin the bish lately even though i find the man to be (spence insert funny and smart word here). I blatantly bring food and iced tea into class and he sees me but does not say a word i also sleep like a madman. ANd also what is up with the garlic cream cheese in the bagels from LDH. Supreme nastiness.  So to contribute to the COBB (Circle of Bateman Bashing), i will now speak about that terrible piece of shit model that bateman and ricci, and horkins (Though I bet horkins didnt contribute to its crappiness because he is da bomb) built. What can i say? I spent three quarters of their presentation laughing. Ricci held his pooey head in shame ----while bateman and horkins floundered around in front of the class. The friggin 27 foot water bottle was what ruined it for me, and when spence examined the physics of a monkey trying to drink from a hapster water bottle, I almost joined "foreskin" in soiling my depends.  Something that many of you will find interesting is that I recieved a flyer in the mail today advertising Forest Hill Real Estate. Gracing the primo flyer with her beautiful face was none other than Wanda Cowie. So hot right now. I might just have to relieve my stress right now. Anyhow, i had no idea that she was a real estate agent. No offence, but i gathered that she was a sort of soccer or stay-at-home mother. She is a mad hot barbie doll and now with that sophisticated business woman appeal, she seems even more toight and sexual.  adios  -bish the fish

      Bateman, that is honestly the most accurate Tompkins impersonation on this website to date. Here is a better one:  "Roses are red, Violets are blue, Bateman's a jerk, and so are you!" -excerpt from a Valentines Day poem by WT himself.  And it does seem this site is becoming something of a cult. We should have a seance or something.  We played hip-hop hangman in our tuesday buddy meetings. Little Pope got up there and wrote "2_ _ _" uh... I dunno... maybe it's 2Pac. But anyways props to Hudson for making me guess for a while until I got all three names of the other diplomats (not CAm'ron).  Okay, I never claimed to be a hockey expert, but these are my playoff predictions so far: Anaheim vs. Dallas: Anaheim is winning this series in 4. Because they are the ducks, my new favourite team. And D2 is one of the greatest movies of all time. Emilio Estevez rules! Vancouver vs. Minnesota: Okay, Tod Bertuzzi might just rule, and the Canucks are Canadian, but I have to go with the underdog WILD! Because that Dwayne Roloson is just the greatest! NJ vs. TB: Okay New Jersey most likely will win this series, but let's face it: how delicious would an Anaheim/Tampa final be? eh? Would Gary Bettman not go insane? I hate that Gary Bettman! Go Lightning and Dave Andreychuck rules! Philly vs. Ottawa: Okay, I hate both these teams. But I guess that the Sens are winning so they'll probably advance but they will lose in 4 to either Tampa or Jersey! I hate how on the Ottawa Senators website they say like "GAME 5 Tonight in The Nation's Capital!"... wow I didn't know Kenata was the capital of Canada!?  So that's my predictions The ducks and the wild will duke it out for the west and of course the ducks will win in 4, and then the lightning and the Sens will battle it out in the east where the lightning will emerge victorious with St. Louis' patented UVM magic. That's right a small market final! Where the Mighty Ducks, a team named after a kids movie will bring home the cup and put Orange County on the map as the hockey capital of the world! Man, who'd a thunk Anaheim would win 2 major sports chamionships in one year... I did! So when it happens, remember you heard it from me first!

      Haha Spence, such a crazy fellow, and yes murder is illegal. And now a word from WT:  "Just let me say this John Spence, what Bateman will be, what he shall be, and what he was. Yes? Alright then. (Dramatic pause) As Bob Dylan so eliquently phrased it.. "Do not go gentle into that good night" no, wait it was Dylan Thomas. I apologize. I have always thought that it takes a great man to apologize and a prophetic fool to apologize over and over again. Yes? Alright then. (Dramatic Pause) (Even more of a dramatic pause)............" Anyway that was an exerpt from our last english class, except for the first part, I made that up.  John Spence aka Arkadina has joined the flounder Online Cult, as Goose says: "Greetings (with some spaced out eye movement)". Another good dance on the weekend was the BSS Formal, I must say that i thouroughly enjoyed myself and next year a Limo Bus or an RV is the way to go! It was sweet, a little bubbly along the way was a nice touch. But I have also heard good things about the 9-10 semi, poor Harjoe, GHB is some messed up stuff.  Continuing with the playoffs theme, I have heard from reliable sources aka Cowie (who is hooked up through the T-dot aka TO aka Toronto aka York) that Shayne Corson was forced to resign from the TML by Pat Quinn because of the distraction he caused by Suitable Engaging and eXtrenous chatting with one each other. Anyway Leafs in 9 is all I got to say.

      Hey Fifty aka ferrari...F-50 , i am sorry to hear that you will not be able to attend the Wham Bam "who gives a damn" Jam, this year because it has a suprisingly solid lineup thus far with more to come. Jigga and 50 will certainly tear up the stage as both artists always put on a good show....plus being able to witness their ridiculous entourages will be jokes all on its own. But dont worry pooh bear, u will be their in spirit and if u want i will wear ur bling for u....G-UNIT FOR LIFE !...man we are soo white, oh well its all good.  well as i sit in our school's terribly dull and bland library beside bishop, such a great fellow...i realize that this place can be terribly depressing at 9:30 in the morning... on a seperate note, i just want everyone to know that i OFFICIALLY called that the mighty ducks were gonna make a run at the cup before the playoffs started, confirmation of this fact will be given by MIke Murphy in the UCC sports shop for all of you doubters. The ducks are the shit, quack quack quack... enuff said...all they need is emilio estevez coaching and they would be set....  this past weekend i had the pleasure of working at the grade 9-10 semi formal in the creativity center, it was a splendid affair...tainted partially by one poor fellow passing out, the guy had to be taken out on a stretcher with 3 paramedics, a moniter and he was hooked up to something as well. i feel bad for the character, its terribly embarasing for him especially when his mom and dad showed up and hsi mother smacked him in the face, oh...he woke up then....he's in trouble i bet. nevertheless, the dance was fun, highlighed by horkypoo's appearance at the end, as well as the sight that a lot of us saw that i happen to notice,of a the young lady sitting with ted basinski on a chair in the northwest sector of the creativity center....she was indeed...not wearing underwear, it was a beautiful thing, i think john spence exploded in his pants but that has yet to be confirmed. To all of those who put the dance on..i congradulate u on another successful event.  bye for now and bish....good luck with ur science lab take it easy

      No dude, it's at the Molson Amplitheatre.  Today was GAS day (Go And Serve, pretty dumb name, it's the community service A-day pretty much.  I guess it was fun. I went to the Habitat for Humanity. House building for the homeless like Jimmy Carter does. But we just went to some factory and moved boxes. Me and Cowie were moving these hot water coolers that were apparently very expensive and fragile. There's a science to it. We actually got really good at it. They gave us these drinks that must have been a year old and were donated because there was no label. It turned out to be Apple juice. The barbecue back at UCC was nice. Free food good people. I'll be at GAS day next year.  And the Prep musical is tommorrow and the next day, so I'll probably go to that. Photo op, you know?

      Flounder, its at Canada's Wonderland, not the fuckin Amplitheatre. Anyway our beloved Leafs are out of the playoffs, well all I have to say is "At least we don't live in Philidelphia!" Honestly who the fuck puts cheese on a steak what stupid fucking cocks, I am deeply saddened that I did not recieve the Philly TP that was offered at Q107, but even my ass is too good for that. However the Canucks advanced to the second round, which is good news, but I have a special place in my heart for those Mighty Ducks. Curling Cujo's wings in 4 what a great upset, and it looks like those kids in Detroit will be getting some extra attention with Cujo's bum chums aka. "Cujo's kids" (The real reason he left Toronto). I think I speak for everyone when I say what a fucking Fisher Price Tool, and by saying "Quack, Quack, Quack!" Lets get Mckell out there to work the flying V and destroy those Stars (by the way watch out for the knuckle-puck).

      You know bish, he just might...  But let's not dwell on that. What we  shall  dwell on, however, is the fact I will not be attending KISS 92's annual "Wham Bam Thank You Jam" which usually has a pretty bad line up but this year they have managed to put together what will probably be the best rap show to ever come to the T-dot. The original Jiggaman, HOVA himself, H-to the IZZO V to the IZZAy, Jay-Z and The most prolific new rap artist of our time, no. 1 with 9 bullets, 50 CENT aka Ferrari.  I know I've made fun of Bateman for his Dave and Coldplay concerts but this is SERIOUS. Not only will I be at camp, but even if I weren't half the tickets are probably on Jay Maddog Michaels desk. Meaning Horkypoo, Toronto's biggest 50 fan will not be seeing him live with JAy Z on Canada day.  And it's at the AMPLITHEATRE!!!  fucking honestly...

      Well I am in history class right now in the library "doing a project." somebody smells so bad; like he forgot to cook something he ate and it died inside his throat. We just had the "Library" for the 10009834732872nd time. I put those brackets there because I have no idea if she is married or not. If she is, her husband must keep something in her mouth to stop her from ruining his life with that annoying voice of hers. I wonder if Tapscott would do her. He said today that he would do anything older than grade 8. A person qualifies then. She's right up his alley I bet. Well I gtg goet some ice cream. adios.

      It's one of those movie review posts so hang tight...  Rob Marshall's  Chicago  has been called "Best Picture" by the Motion Picture Association of America, and now, for all it counts for, me too. Having seen an excellent broadway production of the play not two weeks earlier, I came in with some high expectations. I can now say that I am a huge fan of this play, movie, whatever. I love  Chicago !   Chicago  is simply a great movie. It's just got all the ingredients that makes a great film. The great story is already there (I mean it would be hard to fuck this one up, I mean, it's Chicago for christ's sake...). But you can't blame it all on Bob Fosse. Rob Marshall brings such a great vision to how this story should be brought to the screen.  Chicago  is way more than just a great play on film. The best elements of the film are things you simply could not do on the stage. And sure, it's an all-star cast but who'd-a-thunk these actors could pull off such great performances. I was a little underwhelmed by Renee Zellweger but she was still good (her best performance by far was Jerry McGuire!). Queen Latifah was perfect for the part of Mama, just perfect. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere just had that "I never knew they could sing/dance/act so well" dynamic. And, wonderful as always was hometown favourite: Colm Feore. Bringin' the "Feore Factor" to his role as Assisstant DA Harrison.  Do I have to tell you the music was good? Because it was. After seeing numbers like "Cell Block Tango" and "We Both Reached For The Gun"(the puppet song) it becomes very clear that this is the year's best picture. Great soundtrack by the way.  The way the film switched between the "real world" and the fantasy "vaudeville world" was so appropriate and done very well. Kudos to director Rob Marshall.  Okay and for the real "big question" about Chicago... Yes, it might be "gay" for a guy who is overly concerned with his masculinity to see this movie while not on a date but hey, if you can appreciate a good musical as much as me it shouldn't matter. If you can't, then you better hope you can find a girl who hasn't seen  Chicago  yet because this film is absolutely not to be missed on the big screen.  5 stars. signing off.

      Whoa Bishop you should get that cough checked out. It doesn't sound too good, especially with exams fast approaching and with the recent SARS outbreak in Toronto. Flounder its ok that you editted my post, it is after all your website. Reading the past entries I have realized that no mention has been made of one, Steve McKell. It just so happens that today I have an interesting McKell story that occuried today... As I exited the library to attend history, he acknowledged my presence by saying "Bateman!......" in a low booming voice, eager to escape another one of his stories about UVM's (University of Vermont) basketball team or something like that, I hurried to class, and pretended as if I had not heard him. However I now feel sorry for the varsity badminton coach as I am probably the only person that will talk to him, the unfortunate thing is that he really dislikes me. Anyway more McKell stories on the way. GO LEAFS GO.

I am honoured to be invited to join this blog and to join the ranks of such great human beings like Christopher Horkins and *cough* bateman *cough*. I hope Hudson joins soon, such a great fellow. Maybe WT can post here one day soon. Anyhow, I have to go return my tux from the Batt to this really weird depressed dude that works at the tuxedo store. Kinda funny guy though. Might be funny to prank call some time (not that I do that or anything, pretty immature if you ask me). Check out the last name (so fitting):  Aaron  Grim  416/923-4611

      B to the man-dot: I hope you understand my editing of your posts as this is a public website. Keep your big secrets on the downlo, lowdown, no doubt, covert ops, you know'm sayin'! But so what if I drank half of Devon's coke. The boy had had enough and that sugar is not good for a young man. He was getting a sugar high and I mean "What's new Pussycat" was on the radio. I didn't want him to be too hyper to dance to it! And speaking of our good friends Bish and Hudson. They have both approached me about being able to post on Flounder Online and you should be seeing them around here soon. PEACE OUT  PS So what if I'm invincible and want to take on the world. The World thinks it's so tough... punkass world.

      No worries about the Burbs Flounder, its kool. I's already got one, but its always nice to have a spare. It appears that our dear friend Flounder has become some sort of vaccum. Not only did he pick up just about anyone's coke at the after party for 'Working' (great play by the way if you happened to miss it, and props to Flounder for the excellent job that he did). Yeah so Chris walked around taking other people's cokes seemingly undetered by the recent SARS outbreak that has swept through the T-Dot, he became quite full of coke. In his coke endused state he inhaled half of a $30 cube. This experience was deemed ''not enough' by our hero, he then went to New York, where he was given, what has been described as a nod of approvement by Geoffery Pringle, not to mention a Fitty Cent bling by Hudson Sullivan, so he know feels that he is near invincible and wants to take on the world. In other news, according to Alex Bishop, the 'hottest woman'  is on a little know site www.tubgirl.com, personally I don't think so, however if you have not checked it out you may think otherwise. I am now off to go blinging with Horkins at a dumb play so take it easy and lay off the chems.

I'll ask hoody. We're seeing Chicago the musical tonite. It'll be sweet.  Cool Links to see now!!!!   urlLink 50 Pence- In Da Pub  - a british version of "in da club"... hilarious  urlLink Ludikrishna feat MC Vikram- Welcome to India - ditto with Ludacris' and JD's "welcome to atlanta" but an indian version... brown people are funny  PEACE OUT it snowed today but George, you are stilling missing a good time!

      The first two nights of  Working  are over and tonight is the last night of the show. So far we've had two amazing shows both ending with a Standing Ovation (!!!). I've received rave reviews from Barter, Hudson, AKi, among others so it's not just a show for parents to see their kids. The band is amazing, we've been nailing every song and monologue dead on and let's just hope we close on a good note so we can just forget it all and PARTY!!!!!!   And then me and George have to be on a bus at 5:30 the next morning for the NYC trip. Which despite the unfortunate departure time looks sweet, but the weather doesn't look so good but hey, weathermen can be wrong and the weather is just screwy now... SNOW, in april... honestly.  That's all I got. see working. peace.

      Just came back from my end of year hockey team go-karting party and it was amazing, came second to some guy on my team that actually does go-kart racing.  One guy on my team almost killed one of the guys working there.  The guy was moving some tires when this guy (Rob Citrullo) comes around the corner, tries to swerve around him, but skids and takes out all the tires and forces the guy to jump over the kart.  The worker landed flat on his face and had to jump up and run off the track to avoid being hit by anyone else.  Stupid worker. Anyways the reason I am posting is to avoid being labeled a hypocrite.  For those of you who remembered, I lashed out at Bateman for his gay jokes.  Unfortunately, in my last few stories I forgot about my rant and made gay jokes about Bateman and Horkins respectively.  So I am just apoligizing for my hypocritical ways.  By the way go-karting rules!!  Although I hit my elbows on the damn tires and burned them both up pretty good.  These things are just not made for tall people.  For those of you wondering where I get all my quotes that aren't from songs, well I get them from "The Official TMNT Web Site" which is the homepage of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!  Cowabunga Dude!!  "A fair face may fade, but a beautiful soul lasts forever." some guy Cooplander keeping it real in the 'Tobes   P.S. Chris, Coldplay? I don't know man, ou est Gob, ou Linkin Park?

      The updated version of H-kins's top 5 favourite bands/artists of the moment:  1. Coldplay 2. The Tragically Hip 3. Ludacris 4. 50 Cent 5. Radiohead  Now remember this is the "what I am feeling right at this very moment. 50 drops from no. 1 to 4 because well, he hasn't really done anything in a while, his last single was 21 (or Magic Stick depending on how you look at it) and I'm just not feelin it so much any more. He really should put out a video for Many Men... Luda leapfrogs fitty due to his hot new song from the 2fast 2furious soundtrack "Act A Fool". Radiohead, a newcomer this week on the charts due to a conversation between me and my friend Bateman about what makes a great song. Recalling an album I loved from Radiohead, "The Bends" I downloaded "high and dry", "creep", and their new one "there there", all quality tracks... The Hip move up to 2 just because they are like, eternally great and other artists fade and grow but they're always up there. And the big thing your all probably going "what the...?"  about is the new number one and new on the chart, Coldplay. Well, it seems after James Ricci's performance of "The Scientist" in assembly, I became very interested in Coldplay and listened quite a bit to tracks off Rush of Blood such as In My Place, Clocks, and yes, The Scientist... and it just seems that they are the band that I'm feelin the most right now, I'm just feelin it, know'm sayin? And yes, Bateman Simple Plan is off the chart but they're still cool in my books...

      Bateman, while I was on your "panel", I have to admit, I have some grievances with this "Tool of the Year". True, Vons probably does deserve this award, however, with something like "Oompa Loompa factor" being a major criteria, it's kinda rigged in his favor. And we can't blame the  entire  set project fiasco on Ricci, the scale, yes completely his fault. But I blame myself for being generally lazy and not doing any work on it, but yes, that Dove play was quite lame, and toolish. Didn't you make up the nickname Nescafe? He also deserves mad props for having the guts to sing up in assembly. Luca, in my opinion as I said when we came up with this at Starbucks yesterday (mmmm Vanilla Creme Frappuccino), is not deserving of being on this list. I think your dislike for him might stem for the fact that he has his own car... that his parents bought for him. Anyways... Sang Ik? Yes, a major tool. For his general brown nosing in English, as well as his ToK presentation. You should have seen this shit, it was fucked right up. About conciousness or some shit. Nobody knew what the fuck he was talking about. When Justin started to ask questions he just flipped out and started going "that's your opinion, that's your opinion!" I was like I DON'T CARE!!!! Torokvei, yeah I kinda agree with this one. He is a tool, but not that much of a tool, so the 5 spot fits him pretty well.  Canella should be way higher on this list. The whole WAC thing, I know I'm just a bitter little f-ck about it, but it's just effing ridiculous that he ended up Deputy Chair. What a tool.  And I kinda see a pattern here Ian...  Ricci- driven around in H2 by 'driver' Luca- parents bought him a brand new Mini Cooper Torokvei- parents bought him a TrailBlazer after he drove around in his mommy's X5  I think "car envy" should be added to the criteria...  anyways the list is jokes, keep it up!

      Well the academic year has come to an end which means it is time to announce the winner(s) of "  The Tool of the Year  ". The Tool of the Year is based on the following factors, sheer toolness (trying to be cool to other people, the longevity of their tooliness, etc.), stupidity, and of course the Oompa-Loompa factor (on a scale of 1-10). By the way if you are on this list, do not complain or do anything like that, you brought it upon yourself, and I did not come up with this list, it was a judges panel, we feel that these people embody all of the characteristics that tools stand for. So if you are offended, sympathy is in the dictionary between shit and syphallus, now shut up!  Here they are:  1. Michael Stephens 2. James Ricci 3. Luca Corrente 4. Sang Ik Song 5. Max Torokvei 5. David Canella  Normally we don't have a tie for 5th place, but this year we've been forced to make an exception. Ok Heres the run down:  1. Michael Stephens: Is this any great surprise? Cause if it is you need to be slapped across the face (after all he did take the award home last year)! His Oompa Loompa ranking is a 16, the only person more Oompa Loompa like than Stephens is the Oompa Loompa god himself, he is the epitome of the Oompa Loompa species itself. Now the infamous Clothos incident was one of the worst incidents of the year, and everyone knows about that. However, the worst demonstration of his tooliness was way back in September/October, when Dr. Churchward was casting KR2. Apparently Stephens thought that he was 'the best actor' who auditioned and therefore would get a major role. He believed so firmly in this that he quit First Football before he had been cast, it turns out that our beloved director, Dr. Churhward had heard from Angie Silverstein (of BSS) of how Stephens called her a bitch and how she cried. So, no part for Stephens, no First Football, and now, Tool of the Year!  2. James Ricci: Some of you may ask, why Ricci? Well first of all his has an Oompa Loompa factor of 8 which is no Michael Stephens but pretty damn high, plus he has nickname like Nescafe, which is just weird. Anyway if you had been in our theatre class this entire year, you would now be acquainted with this huge tool. Plays like, Richard Corry (which AK insists that Ricci wrote for him, and I believe AK cause he isn't a tool),  The Day They Killed a Dove  (the gayest play known to man, ever, I mean what the fuck is up with those falcons!), his messing up of our set design project, and his Hummer H2 driver, 'Driver'. Now I had suggested that he be the tool of the year, but it was deemed by the judges panel that he sheer toolness had only been at its peak for a maximum of two terms. But what a fucking tool!  3. Luca Corrente: One word, GINO! I mean the guy keeps saying that everyone will buy his car once they see the Italian Job! The kid knows nothing about cars and makes up the biggest automotive related stories ever (a big no-no by the way). Nevermind the Oompa Loompa factor (which is a 5), Luca is just a big fucking tool.  4. Sang Ik Song: Not only one of the most annoying kids in the school, but just an all round tool, mostly for the shit he does in English class, but basically he smokes alot of pole. Table Tennis, Ping Pong? I don't give a fuck! To top it all off he has an Oompa Loompa factor of 7.  5:  Max Torokovei: Why Torokvei? He changes his mind so much! He can be a nice guy to you one minute, but then he'll turn around a be a complete dick to you the next minute. Oompa Loompa factor; a 3. Sorry man but if you see this, you brought it upon yourself.  5: David Canella: Not only did this skater punk piss the fuck out of JJ for the WAC shit he pulled, but he actually tried to become Head Steward. Now everyone is allowed to run for Head Steward, but he went around saying to everyone why he was going to win, and to top it all off he tried to 'bribe' people for votes by letting them push him around, big tool! Oompa Loompa factor; a 7.  Well I'd love to here your responses to this list I think it embodies all of the thoughts of our grade. Let me know what you think.  "Man what a tool!" "You call him a morron and he just sits there grinning moronoly!"

      The big day has finally arrived!  I have kept you all in suspense through the first three parts of the Birth of Cooplander, now let's see how strong a pay off you will all receive.     Cooplander: Birth of a Legend   He enters the room shuts the door and quickly strips his clothes off, eventually he is naked as the day he entered the world.  He is about to start the tanning bed when he remembers all of the signs outside that said to keep his underwear on while tanning, so he just locks the door.  He starts the machine, jumps in and closes the top of the bed.  He puts in his cd in the stereo and just relaxes.   	Man this is just so damn calming, I could do this all the time.  Suddenly, it didnt seem so hot anymore, actually it felt extremely cold.  Even though his eyes were closed he could still tell the lights were on.   	What the f--- is this?  At that very moment he was overcome with extreme pain, a pain he had never felt before in his life.   	SHIT! all of the veins on his body were bulging at the surface of his skin, and as the pain increased his eyes instinctively open leaving his eyes open to the harmful UV rays of the bed. 	HOLY SHIT!!  F--- SOMEBODY HELP!!!!  The girl from the front was trying to open the door, but he had locked it earlier to hide his nakedness from the world.  All of a sudden the pain and coldness is gone, but he cant hear anything on the other side of the door. 	Miss? nothing, no sound 	Miss!? he suddenly realizes what probably happened and is about to get up when the pain returns at least three times as bad. 	HOLY F---!!!!  then everything goes black  	When he wakes up again the tanning bed is off, he gets out of the bed and checks his watch, he had been out for 15 minutes.   	What the f--- was that?  He scans the room and sees nothing out of the ordinary. 	Maybe I dreamed it.  Yeah thats it a dream. Then he notices the mirror in the room, and to his shock realized that he is changed.  His hair looked like it had grown.  He ran his hands through his hair and realized it had, it also had gel in it somehow.  Then he realized just how tanned he had become. 	This does not happen with just one tanning session.  No Way.  One more look reveals more changes, his thin frame had not become a very good-looking toight one.  His muscles were also much harder and larger, ALL of the muscles.  Finally he looked up for one last time and realized the drastic change in his face.  For one his acne was entirely gone, not a spot, there werent even anymore acne or chicken pox scars.  As well, his face seemed just a bit better looking than before.   	Damn, Im beautiful! 	Sir are you ok in there?  Suddenly he realized that the woman was still outside and probably still scared.  He unlocked the door and opened it up.  The womans face was extremely pale.  She looked as if she had seen a ghost.  He simply smiled at her and her face light up.  With his confidence high and his clothes off he decided to go a step further 	Hi my names Cooplander Adam Cooplander. Would you please step into my office she took his hand and entered room #6.  45 minutes later they both emerged.              THE END    Well finally it's over!  You now know the story of my emergence as the most beautiful man at UCC.  If any of you would like to hear about the further adventures of Cooplander please e-mail me at adam_cooper@ucc.on.ca  By the way if any of you find any of this scene homoerotic than you can go suck on a log.  "When I look in the mirror, can't believe what I see, tell me who's that funky dude, staring back at me?" - Weezer - The Good Life  see y'all on the flip side from the weird one  ps heh heh Boston Red Sux heh heh

      Last night in lieue of starting my exam studying (which I will do any minute now, i swear) I went to the Jays game with my good pals Eric Estey (who generously provided the tickets), Bateman, and Cowie. Fun times, my friend. Unfortunately we didn't find Jason Morris or Ian Harris (who we figured would have been blazing on the 500 level). But fortunately the Jays totally thrashed the Boston Red Sox. And our Bostonian friends in attendance (aka the old dude sitting right in front of us) were not too pleased at our constant heckling...  "Yeah, more like Boston Red Sux!" "Trot Nixon? More like Trot back to the dugout... cause your out!" "Johnny Damon? More like Johnny Lame-on!"  and various other comments including the ever present "more like, you suck at baseball" were yelled at the Sox players from our great seats pretty close to up front. No fly balls came our way though. I did get to help the Big E pick out his brand new Toronto baseball jersey and hat, as well I picked up a "pimpin" old skool Jays logo flat brim hat... i must say it's pimp toight.  Well, it's all about the TBJ, Jays rule, Baseball north and all that hoowah!  Peace out. (still tryin to find the origin of Peace Out for Wayne)

      Once again history class proves to be creative gold!  New ideas and new settings get ready for more crazy weirdness!  (Dr. Thomas' history class; Cooper and Banks are having a sleep off, Graham and AJ are staring oot the window, J-Rob is trying to look like he's paying attention, Spence and Brooker are arguing about nothing in the corner, Ricci is studying porn on his laptop and Felix, Cowie and Ashwood are having a discussion about history work)  Felix: Yo dogs! The Mexican Revolution was crazy dog! Diaz was all like "No way Bitch!!!" aand Madero was like "Just Bring it" dog it was crazy fosheezy!  Bishop: Oh that is so toight F-Dog! I want to have your babies now.  Ashwood: That was awful Felix, you are like so wrong! That was only 6 level argument at best, you are so stupid! And you suck because you don't play cricket! (Felix, Cowie and Ashwood continue babbling on about the Mex Rev)  (Suddenly a pounding sound begins to infiltrate the history classroom.  The sound grows louder and louder until BANG!!!  Through the wall comes Bateman, Horkins and Tompkins riding Prenay's elephant)  Bateman: If I could buy any car I wanted I would buy a ford focus, it isn't the fastest or flyest car on the road today, but I think Mckell wants one so I would give him rides in it and if I am lucky he will let me have his babies!  Chris: I didn't need to know that Bateman, you are now officially kicked off the blog because of your weirdness!  Tompkins would you like to replace our special friend here on my blog?  Tompkins: Since I'm on an elephant right now I will answer that question by crushing everyone (Tompkins kills everyone except Cooper who runs screaming that he wants to go home to his tanning bed)  Now I must have been on acid, shrooms, pot, coke, crack-cocaine, and heroin to write anything more f---ed up than that play.

      Sucked the jonga? weirdo coopster strikes again. Cooplander play was quite perplexing indeed. Cooked hampsters, fried cooplanders--my god what is going on? 4.25 klons.  So what about Ricci's presentation in theatre today? I do not know where to start. I fear that I will be too harsh. "The Day They Killed a Dove" complete with poster and fancy shmancy lighting and sound. Can I say more?  Well I'm watching the season premier of  The Amazing Race  right now. It is quite interesting. There is a team of NFL wives, models, a married gay couple, some clowns and other interesting people. This is one of the better reality shows out there and I highly recomend watching it. Thursdays at 8 on CTV I believe.  bish

      To echo J to the R-O-C, The Ducks are looking to rebound from a tough 3-0 loss in game 1. And let's hope they do. I so hate the Devils. The Ducks are a team of destiny. Let me fill you in on who is who from movies to the actual team:  Giguere=Goldberg Kariya=Charlie Oates=Banks Carney=Fulton Babcock=Coach Bombay Allaire(goal coach)=Hans (sketchy german dude) Pat Burns=The Evil Coach  So there you go... ah the Mighty Ducks, great flick. That Connie... so hot right now.  Go Ducks Go, kick some devil ass!

      Bonjour mon amis from Cooplander.  Just got back from doing some theatre presentation... man mine really sucked the jonga.  But to make up for those that had to witness my presentation is another really cracked out entry in the WT Challenge.  I wrote this in history class and if someone can come up with something weirder than this one i'd be surprised.  (Mr. Tompkins is reading his favourite poem of all time, Birches, when Doug comes running into the classroom holding something in his hands)  Doug: My Hampster! My hampster! I cooked it! I was drying it off but I fell asleep! It just started shaking and jumping so I thought it wanted to fly!  So I put a parachute on it and and the parachute didn't open!!! Oh Mr. Crazy pants say it ain't so!  Tompkins: I guess you could say the window opened but the parachute did not. (Douglas looks shocked and starts to leave but trips and his deceased hampster goes skidding across the floor, Doug picks it up and runs down the hall) Ha Ha Ha, Oliver is quite the character. (Tompkins closes his eyes, but then suddenly sits up) Why don't we join Mr. Reid outside. (The whole class gets up, except for Cooper who is starting to construct his portable tanning bed in the english classroom, as well Horkins and Bateman are furiously getting down material for the WT challenge.  Finally they all get outside except for Cooper who is still in the English classroom bronzing himself and Doug who is burying his beloved Mr. Crazy Pants.  Horkins: ...And I was all like, I don't want anyone in bed except for Wayne  Tompkins: Stop talking to me Chris, I am not listening to your constant babbling. (Suddenly there is a large flash from WT's classroom and the fried body of Cooper comes flying out of the window and lands in front of the class, because he did not construct his tanning bed correctly)  Horkins: (runs up to Cooper) Oh no Cooper! (looks at the body for a second then sees that this is his chance) Well now I need a new poster on my site now (looks at Tompkins with his big puppy dog eyes) Sir? Would you please join my blogging site flounder.cjb.net?  Tompkins: Well Chris, you've been left in quite a tight situation by Cooper. But I have to say no because if I post I might mistakingly waste some of my precious, expansive knowledge on you. (Then he sits down leans against a tree and falls asleep)  THE END  Wow even for me that story was cracked out!  This makes less sense then the Birth of Cooplander coming on Saturday (shameless plug).  Oh and by the way Bish I think you should come out of hiding to try your hand against Horkins.  Yes I am calling out the legendary Fishy Bishy the toightest of them all, come my friend out of the shadows!  We could have the G-Team leader Horkins rate your story.  I await your response.  A strong performance could give you acceptance in the G-Team (genius team).  A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials. unknown  Arovoir mes amis et bonne chance sur les Examens

      Hahaha Bishop, Horkins deserved to win all along, 4.49 klondikes? What the hell was that? It's Horkins' website and I feel he deserves to win. An excellent query by Bishop on the theme to rice rockets. THEY ARE THE LARGEST PIECES OF SHITE ON THE PLANET. Luca think's they're good, and so does Torokvei. Need I say more? Speaking of Luca, and therefore Will, I feel that they should be removed from the blog, just based upon their lack of involvement, I mean Cooper posts more in a week, than they have since (Well since they've been on the site). An interesting story about Torokovei btw, he has ordered a Chevy Trailblazer, because his mom thinks that a car is 'too showy'. Well last time I checked, getting a $40,000 anything when you are 16, is pretty f-cking showy. In response to Hudson's query, the new Maserati is amazing. Having been purchased by Ferrari's parent company Fiat, the new Maserati is essentially a Ferrari. It has the same transmission as the Ferrari 360 Modena (the paddle shift dealies), enough room for a few sets of golf clubs, and a small backseat area. No doubt that you will see more of them once they get their GT Racing program off the ground (they just got a Formula 1, engine developer to help them out). They say that the 3200 (the Maserati) is targeted towards owners of Porsche 911s, so you should compare it to that. My personal opinion is that it is one of the best cars on the street today.

      Top Ten Reasons Why This Year's WAC Theme Sucks Absolute Wang:  10. It's not the Environment. 9.It's mired in radical political rhetoric, and people don't like to see aborted babies, which is what the anti abortion speakers will show you... (shudder) 8.The "Executive" are tools. 7.It's not The Environment 6.Farouk and Felix think they run the show, but the Branksome chicks completely own their asses 5.What the fuck is "Ethics in Health" anyways? Oh yeah, a bad WAC theme... 4.It's not The Environment 3.Brandon Soraro is Derrick's bitch, I bet he would take a bullet for him, or at least a tv with a picture of him on it 2.Bateman didn't vote for it, neither did Goldman, Ryan Adams, or myself (the only cool people left at WAC), how could it be good?  1. It's not the Environment.  As you can see... pure bitterness about WAC.  But I really can care less now that I am the highest mark in the play writing contest. As Cooper so eloquently put it I am part of the g-team (genius team) now.  5 klons baby! I rule!

      "Who's coming into my lair? said the spider to the fly" God Tompkins is a genius Anyways the wait is over... well at least for the 3rd part of the Birth of Cooplander the 4th will arrive on Saturday            Cooplander: Birth of a Legend Part 3   We now return to our main character entering the tanning salon unaware of what awaits him inside.  He enters and doesnt see anyone around, he waits for a few minutes twiddling his thumbs before loses his patience,  	Hello?  Is anybody there? 	Coming! out of the back comes one of the most beautiful women that Adam had ever seen.  As she approaches the counter Adam says 	Hi I was wondering if I could purchase some time in your bed."                 "Huh?" The girl gives him an annoyed look                   "I mean tanning bed, yeah tanning beds.   	Yes, you can schedule an appointment in any of our many TANNING beds. 	Great, how much? 	Well actually we have a few deals if you look at this here.  We have 10 sessions for $60 and 5 sessions for $25. 	Those sound very appetizing, but I think Ill only go once then see if I like it. 	Sure those are only $10 a session, do you want to go in now? 	That sounds great! hands the girl a $20. 	And 10 your change and you can go right in to tanning room 6 for 20 minutes. 	Thanks!  Adam walks towards room #6, but doesnt notice the girls face go extremely pale as he enters the room, as if something had scared the crap out of her.    What's going to happen?  What scared the girl?  What is Kinkead going to do?  Is Cooper going to get a good tan?  All these questions and more will be answered next time in the finale of  Cooplander: Birth of a Legend   "If you want it, you can have it, but you have to learn to reach up their and grab it."

      Horkins is a genius! Brilliant play, a certain level of ambiguity with that hudson stuff in the changeroom (i can only imagine), the differentiating between locales, the characters, the mentioning of me playing PS2. I loved it all. SO TOIGHT! 5 KLONDIKES. I doubt anyone can top this. I really do. Cooper's was ok. the elephant shit was nuts. holy fuck. 4 klons. H-kins is the master. I bow down to him. I was laughing continuously. None of the same jokes- just pure goldness. I love it. You guys really have to work hard to compare to this one. It was just so good. Horkins, you are no longer just snuggleable, now you are a brilliant playwrite. Hot like a firecracker! Bateman, your bitterness is just overwhelming. Your play obviously deserved more than a 1 man. You can see that. I just graded it so low to make people laugh. It was still pretty bad. The originality of H-kins prevails!  Now about the cars--- bateman does know his shit so don't mess. He would love to be driving with Mckell in some mad rice rocket. His ultimate dream.  peace out --bish  PS. Hudson, I think we need to have a little conversation. It will not be spoken on here though. Mwa haahahahahaaha. (evil laugh)

      Thank You Hudson, I do like to think that I know a thing or two about cars, after all its practically the only thing I know about because as Bishop said I am a retard. Anyway, Horkins your play was funny, but if it wasn't for the Burbs I would never have gotten Torokvei's Mom's #. Lets just leave it at that, the weird and mysterious power of the Burbs works in many ways, you just wait and see. Anyway for all of you automotive enthusiasts out there who think that the Escalade is the best car out there, you need to shut up and listen. Justin Timerlake drives an Escalade, a Viper, a Harley V-Rod, and a Porsche 911 (brand new one), therefore all of these automobiles are condemned to the deepest pits of hell (except for pre-1990s 911s which are pretty good). If you want to show up in the 'flyest' ride on the planet I strongly recommend that you check out this website: http://www.pistonheads.com/tvr/cerbera/gt2_2.htm It talks about probably the ultimate road car on the planet (it is faster than a McLaren F1 and the Pagani Zonda) so therefore it kicks ass, the hottest British Export since the Spice Girls. Enough about cars, Chris I like your new top 5, nice choices there. Time to Sleep.

      Yeah Hudson, I'm sorry but Cody looked like such a flaming queer when he was doing his little dance "baby if you give it to me" the worst was that he kept doing it, thinking it was cool. Pooner's too nice to shut him down...  I'm just glad my mentee was not there...

      Okay Bateman, to clarify my list is my top 5 "of right now" meaning what i'm really into listening to at the moment. If I had to make an "of all time list" then yes, the Stones would be no.1, okay well let's do an all time list:  1. The Rolling Stones 2. Run-D.M.C. 3. Dire Straits 4. N.W.A. 5. The Beatles  happy? well i dont give a crap... and the Escalade rules, and some day I will drive one with fly ass 20 inch rims... (dreams of cruising in future Escalaaaaaaade)  Anyways I had a good, original idea for a six line, so here it is:  "Friday Night Idyllity"  Scene 1- (The streets of the Fo' Hill. Ian is decked out in Burberry Visor and usual gear)  IAN: (on cell phone) Honestly you are the dumbest kid... homosauce... what? Yeah well anyways have a good weekend if I don't see you. (ladies walk by, Ian straightens his posture and puts a wide smile on his face) Hey, how are you? (pause) (points to his visor) Yeah you like it? It's fake! (pause) Well... my mom thinks it's cool, and so does george... and cowie, they think it's hella tight... call me. (pause, watches them walk away) Who needs them anyways. (dials le numero d'une jeune fille on the cell phone, waits for answer) Hey there! It's Ian by the way. What's that? Your Waiting.. for what? Oh you hate me? That's not very nice... anyways, I was wondering if there was a party going on tonight? You're at your grandparents house? family gathering, eh... I'll bring the keg. (pause) hello? (she has hung up.) fuck. (another young woman walks by) Hey, I hear you broke up with that dead weight boyfriend, so I guess you'll be going out with me soon? Yeah? No? I'll take that middle finger as a yes! (pause) I wonder what Cooper is doing...  Scene 2- (Tanning Salon. Cooper Enters and approaches the front desk)  COOPSTER: Hey Megan, I see I've come during your latenight shift, funny how that always happens... even though you changed your shift hours about four times on me... that Craig isn't half the front desk attendant as you. So is my usual bed ready for my weekly friday night bronzing? (pause) okay, I'll wait. (sits down in waiting room. A fly chick comes out from one of the tanning rooms) Hayley, isn't this a coincidence, how we always come here at the same time? I see you're looking nice and tanned, the bronze delicousness is exciting! (pause) what do you mean restraining order? (she leaves) Whatever with her... there are way hotter ladies tanning au naturel just like the Coopster at this very moment. (Cooper gets up when front desk lady isn't looking. goes over to a tanning room marked "occupied by one of the hot ladies of tanning" opens door a crack looks in. We hear a female scream.) Free Tanned for life? Sweet! Oh wait that's a B... "Banned for Life!" Whatever... there are way flyer ladies at the other tanning salon i use, always carry a backup... oh yeah... The Coopster. Wonder what Bish is doing....  Scene 3- (Bish's basement. Bish is playing PS2 or something.)  BISH: Why does everyone think I'm a sketchball because I play Tiger Woods PGA 2003 in my spare time... i don't get it. What is a sketchball? A ball of sketch? Preposterous...  Wow. I think I'm going to give H-kins an unprecedented 5 klondikes for this very play of which I am a part. Or at least enough to edge out Hudson for the Ice Cream. So delicious... (dreams of klondikes) I wonder what Huddy's up to?  Scene 4- (UCC basement, changerooms next to the Lett Gym.)  HUDSON: (Opens door of changeroom from inside, peeks head out. Gives a thumbs up and an intoxicating smile as if to say "SCORE!".) Wait'll horkypoo hears about this... (Hudson then puts his index finger up to his lips and quietly goes:) Sssssshhhhhhh! (then he goes back into the change room for untold adventures. wink wink.)  (after a few seconds passing, a brown janitor walks by humming the tune to Punjabi MC.)  Scene 5- (Horkins's room. Chris is on the computer, his tangerine iMac, writing this very play.)  CHRIS: Hmmm.... I seem to have run out of creative juice, and this play has nothing to do with the subject matter it should... (Eureka! raises a pointed finger, lightbulb appears above head)  (Chris Picks up the phone dials an unseen number.)  Scene 6- (WT's House, Wayne is sitting in his rumpus room in a smoking jacket and bear feet slippers, smoking a pipe, perhaps even a bubble pipe. He has his usual look of "out of it-ness" on his face. His old fashioned, and i mean Alexander Graham bell probably made it, telephone rings. He answers.)  CHRIS (over phone): Sir it's me... uh... Auwal, yeah Auwal, from class. Do you, uh... like anyone in class, like more than a friend? What about that Horkins? I hear he has a blog that he wants you to post on... in fact he is sending you priveleges to post right now... yeah... as a token of affection... and he really likes your exam review package. I mean... yeah... wanna post?  WAYNE: Well Owl... I can't see why you're inviting me instead of Chris, I didn't know he was so shy. Well, Mr. Eeeesa Odeeedeee! Lovely name... like Samuel Taylor Coleridge... so many syllables. (drifts off, then wakes up again) Well then, If I really want to be a true scholar of the internet, Owl, I should join Chris's blog and maybe download some l33t Snes Romz from your own website. Alright then, don't think I don't research my classmates, and btw, I owned you in CounterStrike last night. (click, Wayne hangs up.)  THE END.  Okay, yeah, i think this will be the last one... cause, yeah. and it may seem like it has 7 lines but one carry's over two scenes, it's the same character. So yeah...   Anyways it's getting late and the ducks are losing which is totally not good.  And Simple Plan is quality pop-punk/emo/whatever and they're french canadian which only adds to the pleasure.  Peace out homeys.

      holy crap,  i fell off my chair when i read that prennay had his assignment handed to him by an elephant, that shit was hilarious....fuck cooper, i loved it! anyways besides that terrifc part of golden boy's impressive play, i just want to say to bateman that im actually with u on a few things in ur rant today for one, simple plan does suck....because i don't listen to them, thats right u heard me....jks. anyways about the porsche dont worry about offending me about the car thing haha cus my dad has one i cant even back that thing out of the driveway...but its not because im like a bad driver or anything......"just shutup hudson" BUT if u wanna talk about bad cars, specifically porsches lets not forget the infamous porsche boxter, i'd rather drive a cardboard BOX on wheels, dont get me started with that fake piece of shit.....(bitterness) but on a serious note guys, i for one believe that ian has a ton of credibilty when it comes to talking cars, he undoubtedly knows his stuff, so altho he may have a point of view u dont agree with, it might be worth listening to...so u can laugh at him afterwards...jks again....dont worry bateman, i'll listen to u....for a little bit at least anyways hope u have a good nite guys, bish i am looking forward to an intriguing review much love hudson  ps. for my fellow posters who were at the mchugh's wing nite aka horkins it is official that i did piss my pants after watching my mentee Cody Dolgay with the assistance of his pool cue do a rendition of Busta Rhymes ft. Mariah Carey "I know what u want" all i have to say is ....wow..what was he thinking..oh man

      Well Bishop if you're going to mark the stupid plays like that, why do I even try? I mean give me some credit I am not that dumb, and so what if I made fun of Cooper, I bet if Spence or Hudson did it you would be liking it up like some kind of likable gold substance. I heard alot of ppl wet their pants when they read it (like cowie and george to name a few), I don't care if you give me a bad mark, but if you give a 1 then it's pretty fucking obvious. Anyway, Horkins Simple Plan sucks, its for a bunch of pre-pubesant boys who haven't realised that they are going to get ripped off by buying their record, and if I recall correctly you said that Run DMC were the best rap artists of all time, and that you loved the stone's 40 licks. But hey it's your website and you can put whatever crap you want on it. Btw I have been taking a bad wrap lately because I have said that Porsche 911s suck, and in my opinion they do (no offense Hudson, i know your Dad has one), if you want to talk about cars, bring forth an educated and opinionated argument forth, and I will tell you why you are wrong/right. And yes the Cadillac Escalade is a piece of shit.

      You've seen the first two parts of Cooplander's Birth and now it is time to tell you all of the adventures in WT's English class, in a six line play.  I am not a literary genius like Hudson, or a comedic like Horkins, or repetitive like J-Roc, but I am weird so we'll see if that works in my favour. (Scene is Wayne Tompkins IBI English class.  The WT is currently taking attendance.)  Tompkins: OK everyone your Family Memoirs are due today, but I must take the attendance first.  Bateman hmm nothing, Bishop ah there you are!  Cooper Cooper (Cooper is sleeping on his desk) oh he must not be here! Ah well this takes too long Ill just do it after Tim comes.  Now your family memoirs are due today and as some poet said that I cant remember the name of Im coming for them. This wont be a problem because you all have them done, yes?  (collective groan from the class) I think I will collect from some random order, Prene? Do you have your family memoirs?  You do not?  Well Im sure you shall bring it to me soon  Tompkins:  Ah Mathers yours is complete!  Lets see the first one, How My Psychologist keeps me from going postman on everyone Seems interesting Robert.  And Awal?  Oh he isnt here.  Ha ha ha, that is funny! Nowers?  Nowers:  Yes sir this is a study into the idiocy shown by the Bush administration, and how we are all going to die because of the US.  I know I was suppoused to write a family memoirs but that isnt as interesting as how we are all going to die!  Tompkins: Yes Cooper where is yours?  Oh hes still asleep I shant awake him, Im sure he needs it, for we dont know why he is asleep. (at this moment an elephant hands Prene his assignment) Ah Prene your assignment how wonderful! (turns to chris) Chris shall we be receiving your essay today?  Horkins:  (chris squirms in his desk until he thinks up an amazing idea) Well no sir, but I think that a much better way of marking me would be to analyze my amazing site Flounder Online!  It is much better than any memoir assignment and if you like it you can join and post among the chosen few!  Tompkins:  Well that sounds splendid Chris!  I could finally give my knowledge to those who can appreciate it.  Id love to hear all of your opinions on the Silken Tent a masterpiece of a poem.  As well, I would love to see your Family Memoirs assignment on this site Chris because you cannot squirm your way out of this assignment.  Thats all Folks! If that didn't beat Hudsons then... it probably wasn't that good. Remember part 3 of the birth of Cooplander, be ready for anything. Just a few more days until the finale.

      Review time.  Bateman: yours was utter crap. 1 klondike. Be original. Don't just write the same sort of crap over an over again. Try a different setting, new characters, something please for the love of God before I go slowly insane.  H-kins: Pretty off the hook. Love the shit about WTs computer, the pronunciation of Awal's name, etc. Little things that we all think and never say. I love the attention to detail like titling your play. I'm deliberating whether or not to give you a mark as high as hudson's. I went back to read them both over and over again. Hudson's narrowly edged you out once again. 4.49 klondikes.  Cooper- write a play before i tell all the ladies u pick up at the tanning salon how weird you really are. Haha man jks.  bish

      Okay, we've had a lot of hate and theatre on the blog lately, so I though I would switch it up and give you my insight on music:  H-Kins's Top 5 Musical Artists/Bands Right Now:  1. 50 Cent 2. Ludacris 3. The Tragically Hip 4. Eminem 5. Simple Plan  So as you can see, my tastes veer towards Hip-Hop and Rock... I might take some heat from hardcore punk rock enthusiasts (ie AJ, Ihnatowycz) for putting Simple Plan up there (they just edged out Coldplay, but I was just feelin' there music a bit more when I wrote the list). Maybe I'll update this weekly/monthly/yearly/whenever i feel like it.

      Cooper man, where's the love? If you can't take a joke then get out of the firing squad man, or something like that some proverb, haven't you read some of Spence's old posts, he made fun of me alot. And yes Cooper, you may say that you are going to kick my ass, but where's the love? We were in the Phildephia together man. I think that everyone should applaud your efforts with the ladies at the tanning salon, but when you talk about male models its funny but very homo-erotic aswell. Thanks for talking about Pink Triangle, Pinkerton is a great Album. At least you don't eat dog, drive your mommy's X5 and have a 'Burberry Fishing Hat' [I am talking about Torokvei], or claim to be the best driver in the world.

      Bateman enough with the gay jokes man.  Come on it works the first few times, but come on I think you can come up with some new and interesting ways to make fun of me.  I sure as hell give you enough material in English class, just look at everyone else's plays, not many of them use gay jokes or innuendos.  The only reason I ran with this Cooplander gimmick (invented by David Riesman) is because I like to make people laugh.  People were entertained so I just thought what the hell.  So I tan who cares, its a hell of a way to meet women, you have no idea how many fine ladies tan.  I've picked up a few and damn are they hot!  I admit I like tanning, but the women is what kept me coming back.  If you can come up with an easier way to meet beautiful ladies, please fill me in 'cause I'd really like to know.  By the way Bishy I wrote this entire story in a couple hours because I was bored and I am aware that my story and the way I act is a little weird, but I do it on purpose, as I said I like to entertain people.  Sorry for getting on a rant guys, but I do have some self respect.  I ain't no dart board.  The quotes are for fun too, I enjoy putting them up, as I said I like to entertain you guys. Sorry Bish you just got caught in the line of fire, Bateman you can't say you didn't have this coming.  Be careful who you insult Bateman, one day someone's gonna kick your ass.  "Action may not always be happiness, but there is no happiness without action."  You thought I was gonna stop with these?  You will still see my next installment on Wednesday, I was just a little pissed off that's all, I just needed to get that off my chest.  Cooplander signing out and expecting a backlash

      Scene: WTs class.  Bishop: Ok sir, the following people don't have it done because I've been snooping around all day collecting names, Cooper, Nowers, Awal, Sang-Ik, Bosco, Horkins and Bateman.  Bateman: And just to add to that sir, Mathers is smoking at the back of the class.  WT: Bateman shut up, no one likes a tattle tale, you now have a 2. And, Bishop, it appears that we have a Caesarian Soothsayer in the midst, very good you get a 7. Ok Cooper, now that you have finally handed in your assignment, how about you read some of it for us.  Cooper: Ok, its called the birth of Cooplander. When I was young, I displayed many blattantly homo-erotic tendencies, I was placed in hockey leagues and eventually my parents thought that they had gone away. They were wrong. Everywhere I went, I felt like bending the cute waiter over, or flopping onto my knees in Mr. Arkin's class. It seemed that everyone in Toronto was commiting fashion crimes that no one seemed able to prevent it, except for one woman trapped in a man's body, Cooplander! My alter ego naturally. Suddenly there were accounts in Etobickoe (or however the f-ck you spell it) of a man, with an all over tan where in a thong, running around saving everyone with poor fashion sense. The secret to the Cooplander's magical powers is that he has to recharge them at the tanning salon. Now you know the full story of Cooplander.  Horkins: Sir, before you give us your eloquent comments about Mr. Cooper's piece, I would like to say this: If you were as appauled and revolted at this as I was, then please post your comments on my 'weblog', or 'blog' horkypoo.cjb.net, or if you prefer, flounder.cjb.net  WT: This is an interesting proposal Chris, but in truth I rather enjoyed Cooper's piece.  And Scene     Now Bishop the only reason you are mentioned is because you narked me out in class today.  Second, Hudson, there is no reason why ppl smoke, of the few butts I had, I found that I enjoyed the taste more than anything, but it is something that you will have to find for yourself, and yes it was a really big/bad f-ck up on my part. And Nowers, I don't smoke.  Third, Cooper, shut up about your damn Cooplander BS, it only inspires me to wirte plays.

      Play in a Play in a Play...  Scene- WTs Class, Wayne is droning on and on about a Robert Frost poem, probably two looking at two or something. As usual no one is listening to him. J-F Boucher pretends to listen, as does the Dougler. Prennay is being his normal weird self. Cooper is curled up in his golf shirt, lying back to the full extent on his crappy green school chair, head tilted back, eyes closed.  WAYNE: And you see, you have to know Two Looking at Two, inside and outside... if you want to be truly versed in the literature of Robert Frost, outside these walls at least. Take the word all (pause) ALL.... That must be all. (pause) see how powerful this is? Cooper, whats your take on this poem?  COOPER: Uuuugh! (still asleep) (everyone laughs at cooper)  WAYNE: Well I see this is rather boring for you chaps, so its time for a new approach. I got an electronic mail from my friend in the math department Steve Griffin about a website known as Flounder Online, where a number of you chaps post some six line plays about this class. And I thought we could give this website a visit so everybody gather around the computer, but dont touch it unless your name is Wayne Tompkins.  (everyone gathers around Wayne at the computer)  DOUG: Hey, Bateman! I made out with Meg McNicol, not Cooper! (pause. everyone looks at Doug weirdly) I mean... yeah it was Cooper.  AUWAL: Hey, no one ever mentioned me in their plays, alright! Kung Fu Kenneth!  WAYNE: Thats because you never come to class, Owl... which is why I cant pronounce your name correctly! (sneezes) damn this hayfever! Anyways, Ill be expecting posting priveleges from you boys soon. I hope my typewriter at home can access it...  END SCENE!  okay, if this does not cut it, then I quit....

      Horkins, your site has now lost much credibility after hosting the unfathomable garbage spewed forth by Cooplander. Don't get me wrong, I love it. Cooper's weirdness will forever make me giggle but WOW! I never knew there was such a level of oddity. Cooplander, you are a nut. The way you say shit like "snootchie bootchies" just makes me shake my head and wonder what the fuck your parents have done to you. I think though coopy, that you just stay up really late at night watching cartoons and wrestlingo And thinking up these brilliant ideas that you write of on this website. How in god's name do you come up with this shit? I have heard drunk, sleep-talking crack-heads speak more sense. Cooper why don't you give us a little window into the life of "coopler" as bateman the retard calls you.  H-kins, congrats on the tie. I'm thinking of becoming a theatre guru of some sort next year. On another note about the 6-line contest, the contest will be coming to a close at the very end of this month (Midnight on saturday). Hudson is in the lead so far. I know you guys have some left in you so come on and churn it out. Hudson's plump figure sure doesn't need anymore klondikes so im hoping for Christopher "pimp daddy" Horkins to aim for the top. Cooper might come up with some weird cracked-out shit and steal the prize.  Cooper is so frickin weird - Canadian proverb -   bish

      Hello all!  Just returned from an intense tanning session.  I'd like to congratulate myself for receiving a first team tie for golf.  But I think I know why all of you are reading this... to read PART 2 of  Cooplander Birth of a Legend !  And here it is the second installment of an epic saga.                   Cooplander Birth of a Legend Part 2   In the year of 1998 Harry Kinkead was the premier male model.  Magazines clamoured for his services, he fetched upwards of $30000 a photo shoot.  Considering that he did about 250 shoots a year he was very well off.  But he had become addicted to the fame, the drugs and the women.  He let his workout program tail off and as he grew older his world-renowned six-pack from heaven began to disappear.  As well, he had found that marijuana was not strong enough for him, he moved off into coke, than crack cocaine, then finally heroin.  Well this combined with his eating habits sent him in a spiral downwards.  By 2002, he could no longer fetch the $30000 photo shoots; he was now at max a $10000 per photo shoot model.  Angered at being surpassed by others and ignored by the major modeling labels he turned to the Italian mafia.  They were able to make offers that the major magazines were unable to turn down and soon Kinkeads modeling career was alive once again.  But being apart of the mafia was dangerous and Kinkead was never a very smart man.  He began to ignore requests by the mob and eventually they grew quite tired with his antics.  On the night of November 27th, 2003, he was ambushed after a party and murdered by Johnny hard hands Stamboli.  It has now been 6 months since he was killed.  Unfortunately, his spirit cannot rest, at least not until he achieves revenge on those who wronged him.  He has looked all this time for someone that he can possess that has the beauty to succeed in the model world.  He now knows who that man is, that man is Adam Cooper.  Thanks all for reading the second installment of my story.  Part 3 will be released on Wednesday and the end of our hero's epic struggle will be shown to the masses on Saturday.  A closed mind is like a closed book; just a block of wood. - Chinese Proverb -   Stay tuned Wednesday... snootchie bootchies!!  Cooplander garcon model

      live from Geo class:  I was shocked and apalled this morning to have been left of Dr. Churchward's list of Theatre Arts Tie Achievers. I had to settle for a more modest, non assembly presentation of the tie in Systems class with Matt "your lapels are too low" Cowie. And I still have to deal with this with DC... I wear this tie in shame almost now... Although I am happy I have the tie and I'm just content to leave this all too touchy subject alone.  And hudson, me and J-to the R-O-C over there have resolved our differences, but hey, this is  my  site, don't forget, our squabbles are free to be posted.  Cooplander: I speak for everyone when I say, I can't wait for the next installment of the Birth of Cooplander. great stuff.  Paice

      Hello all from the tanned man.  Hudson man u are right on about the cigarrettes, no point guys, although I'm not one to talk I've probably inhaled more second hand smoke in my days then both Horkins and Bateman have smoked.  Secondly, I'd like to join in the congratulations to the Flounder for his Hamish Simpson victory.  Unfortunately, I could not be there today because I was working at the ungodly hour of 5 AM!!!  I had to get up at 4 AM!!!!  I have not been awake at that hour in at least a year.  See I work at a golf club and for some reason people wanted to have a shotgun at 7:30.  Anyways I am tired beyond belief and to top it all off I missed Horkin's greatest achievement sports wise to date.  I can't deal with this lack of beauty sleep.  Anyways everyone look out for part two of  The Birth of Cooplander .  All instalments of this series will be released every two days.

      hey first off congrats to pooh bear and "the judge" for their victory on the links ...well done! BUT chris u and ian have some sort of ...i dont even know what to call it..we'll say "disagreement" going on here and u are making it public by putting it on horkypoo, this is a sight dedicated to interesting discussion and humour aimed at those goofy non-posters (exceptions: bateman and cooplander) nevertheless this site is not a realm that facilitates arguments amongst each other so if u two have issues about something than take it up in person and solve it, dont make it public and even more trivial and ridiculous than it already is. Thanks a lot guys, hope u had a great weekend hudson  and will someone tell me why people smoke cigerrettes anyways...please someone address this because i dont see what u possibly get out of it relaxtion? serenity? do u feel cool or accepted by ur peers? cus u shouldn't, its a dumb habit you'll all regret and i for one frown upon u characters....

      I'd like to clear a few things up here.  Okay Ian, so we're straight on this: -In English Nowers was all like "Is it true Bateman's taken up smoking?" and all I said was "yeah". I didn't slander you. I just affirmed his suspicions.  -And two, yes that is way behind us... it better be way the f-ck behind us? I thought this was over.  -and three, no frickin way have I done as much of the cancer inducing tar sticks as you...   Uh... that is all. Can we still be friends?

      Ah, so here I am, fresh off the famous South Course at Angus Glen in beautiful Markham Ontario (home of the 2002 Bell Canadian Open). Where the annual clash of the class of 2004 titans meet to battle on the grassy plain, the Hamish Simpson Golf Classic. In this, it's fourth splendid year, and penultimate outing in it's current format, the deserving team finally came out on top.  This year's low net (that's the big one) champions were none other than the team of yours truly, my dad (aka "The Judge"), John "J-Robs" Robinson, and his father K-Robs. How did we win? I have no frickin' idea. Maybe the fact that Kim was counting the scores up at the end had something to do with it... But anyways, seeing as that's the first sports trophy I've won in several years and probably the only one for a couple more years, I'm gonna enjoy it.

      Well Bishop, it wasn't that Horkins said that, infact Horkins has probably smoked as much as I have. It was another issue, that I think is resolved now. And as for this smoking thing, it was a phase and it is behind me (although i still have to hack some in the play Doug and I wrote) and yes it is a bad habit. Simply put, I was a victim of bad judgement, there you go.

      Cooplander, you are just too weird for words man. I loved your ultratoight outfit on friday's casual dress. T(o)ight shirt, two-tone jeans. So hot right now. So very weird right now.  Bateman, your play was very good man. Very different, a certain level of ambiguity left there. What the hell is this 'clean slut' business? And bateman, you feel a little violated because people know about your filthy habbit of hacking butts? It serves you right. Smoking to seem cool or for any other reason has never worked. Maybe if you are so embararrased about people knowing about you sticking slender cylindrical objects in your mouth, then maybe you shouldn't be smoking u fuck. I did love the line about hudson going to buy smokes for WTs wife: priceless. This play could have pushed the 5 barrier but just because u are a supreme doofus, i will lower your mark substantially. Stop smoking, or if not, at least admit to it and have a decent reason for it dimwit. 4.25 klondikes. (yes that's right. my first 1/4 klondike)

      Yo my homies what's up?  I'll tell you what's up the first part of the birth of cooplander.  Yes you will all be told in a four part series of my transition from Adam Cooper to Cooplander. So sit back and enjoy.  	                                Cooplander, Birth of a Legend   	It was a day like any other, the sun was shining, people playing in the park and there wasnt a cloud in sight.  Unfortunately, for one person this would not be a day like any other.  For him it would be a day with tragic consequences, a day that he would never forget.    	Our main character right now is sitting at home right now playing his favourite game, NHL 2003 when the phone suddenly rings.  He picks up the phone, Yello? 	Its Andrew  	Yo man wat up?  	I went tanning man  	Huh?  	Ya man, you know the fake bake.  	Why  	To look hot man, you gotta look super fine for the ladies  	Whats it like?   	Man you just lay there and sleep for like 20 minutes, its sick man, you should go  	Is it that good?  	Yeah man its amazing you should go  	Sure why not?  Sounds fun  	Yo man I gotta jet, gotta get artificially stimulated  	I see well Ill see ya later.  	Payce.  What Adam did not know about that conversation was that that was not Andrew.  Andrew had never set foot in a tanning salon before.  No, this was someone else, someone he would get to know very well in the future.  	Adam continues to play his game, but his friends advice keeps finding its way into his thoughts.  He had questions, but was unable to reach his friend.  He just kept thinking, would it give me melanoma?  What about cataracts?  Yeah, but I hate being super white, I do want a tan.  Ah f--- it Im going, whats there to lose, its tanning.  Adam shuts off the computer, grabs his keys and jumps into his car.  He pulls out of his driveway and is own his way.  Within minutes he arrives at a mall, this mall also has a small tanning salon tucked into the back corner.  As he walks to the salon he fails to realize how conspicuously few people there are in the mall.  This is as a result of the same person that called him over an hour earlier.  Actually to call him a person would be a mistake because this was no man that Adam was dealing with, it was so much more.  Well there you go guys the first part in the series.   By the way thank you Chris, I am a bronzed god. Bateman one question, who the hell is Meg McNicol?  "I love you like a fat kid loves cakes"  Fitty Cent - 21 Questions Signing out Cooplander, PAYCE!

      Scene: WTs class  Horkins: Sir, did u hear that I can't keep a single secret. Why can't the f*ck can't I keep a secret? I mean, why can't I find a clean slut?-  Cooper: I know a clean slut, the Coopster. I go to a tanning salon, ALL the time, the Coopster. I made out with Meg McNicol, the Coopster. My hairdresser says Im cool, the Coopster! I skip class ALL the time and never get in trouble, the Coopster! I masturbate-  WT: Cooper! Horkins! Shut up!  Hudson: Sir, I can I skip class to buy some smokes for your wife?  WT: Sure Hudson, go ahead.  Horkins: Speaking of smokes sir, do you want to post on my weblog?   And Scene  (I know this sucks (but it was the best I could do), and I did it to prove a point. And no Hudson does not smoke)

      Finally I'm a blogger!  I would like to thank Horkins for the opportunity, Bishy, Hudson and Bateman for keeping me in their plays.  The tanning salon for making me nice and tanned, my hair gel for making my hair able to stay in one place, and my hair "stylist" for making my hair beautiful.  Oh and thank the good lord for the strength to blog.  I am verry happy to have the privlege to blog here, I hope to uphold the (to quote Bishop) the toightness of the blog.  I will soon be an entrant to the WT challenge and you will all soon be privleged enough to learn of the birth of cooplander.  signing out,                     Cooplander  Everybody's a little queer, so why can't you be a little straight.

      Bateman. Yours was pretty shitty man. You can do better. 1.5 Klondikes.  H-kins. Very toight. The columbine references weren't so hot though. Not a big fan. You should probably remove them buddy. 3.5 klondikes now. with edits you could push it a whole cone.

      The past two days I have spent at the chillinest killinest Model Parliament in Ontario, the world famous OMP. Representing the fine people of Haliburton Ontario. I had a fun time with our honorable brown premier Farouk "Fa-Rule" Hussein. Anyways...  Okay, this is my new entry into the play thing.  "A Query"  Scene: (Tompkins's Class. Wayne has not yet arrived. Chris Enters notices on the white board a list of names "A. Cooper, B. Fan, G. Campbell" under "late assignments". Quickly he scribbles "post on flounder.cjb.net, a blog, post there!" and then under it "S. McKell" Chris has a laugh at his work and sits down.)  Bateman: (very upset, grabs Chris) JJ? What the f---? Honestly you are the dumbest kid. You dumb little f---! (Chris looks very sad. Ian suddenly becomes jovial, but still maintains his kung fu grasp on Chris's shoulderblade.) I'm just joking man, that was jokes man. (angry again) But look, that's my bit okay, you have to find your own shit, I started that along with "Aw-Yeeeaah!" and "From Russia with the Lovebone, Muhf-ckuh!" (happy) just jokes flounder, JJ, homosauce, softserve... (laughs hysterically at self)  Chris: Okay...  Nowers: Why do you do this shit Horkins, you're just like the f-cking US Government who are all evil Oil Barons with Oil rigs named after them. Why won't they legalise pot? Because they are evil and the only reason they are in Iraq is because they want to take over the world, but they can't... because they're evil. I am better than all of you. (spits on floor disgustedly.)  Mathers: (quietly on the phone in the corner) yes... hello? Kid's Help Phone? I'm seriously considering killing everyone in my English class a la Columbine because they're always mocking the way I speak, Mr Tompkins says I have a beautiful reading voice dammit, I also have a beautiful crazy voice inside my head telling me to KILL KILL KILL! (this last part is screamed very loudly... everyone stops and looks and Rob who's grip tightens on a formerly hidden handgun)  Wayne: (enters, removes beret, looks at board, looks at Rob) Ah, Robert, are you rehearsing a play for us? Puppy Months? (laughs hysterically in his breathless fashion, no one else laughs) And what is this nonsense on the board? Bateman? (Ian shakes his head no) I know it was you. Please erase it. (Ian gets up and solemnly goes and wipes it out muttering something) Well, I actually already know a lot about this "Flounder Online" being a fellow Irishman, I have Chris's Gift of The Blarney! I can read minds! And I can tell that blogging might also help our troubled friend robert here, yes? (Rob shakes head yes, reluctantly) I knew it would. Bateman, here's job for you, i want you to write me ten posts for Chris's blog for me to post. And Rob, I haven't received your Hemingfrost assignment, it's 50% off...  (Mathers gets really angry and fires a shot into the ceiling, it is very loud.)  Cooper: (awakens quickly) Whuh-what! (jumps up but falls over because his entire upper body is curled up in his golf shirt. Cooper lands with a thud.) oooowie!  (everyone laughs, including Wayne, who was so amused he gave the class a spare, and they all lived happily ever after.)  THE END

      Huddy,       Too toight for words. Wow! Great play Mr. Sullivan. And the fact that you aren't in theatre makes it even better. Noticing the subtle nuances of characters is quite the virtue. For example, seeing that bateman rarely can snarf out a few words of a sentence without laughing. The weirdness of preney is also something that no one else has yet to comment on. One question: who is this 'bert' that you speak of? I would love to know. Brilliant, hudson. 4.5 klondikes. (first one to make me laugh out loud for real).  P.S. Loved seeing your girlfriend out at house softball today. Great looking girl. Not such a good cheerleader though 'cause we demolished you tugs. Mo, mo, mo, motorious!  --fish

      My 6-line play, a little hack i know,  but expect better to come, here it goes  the scene: ( its a beautiful spring afternoon when all children should be outside playing but instead a dew find themselves situated in Mr. Tompkins English Class (even better than playing). Sang Ik" i swear i'll hit puberty" Song is reading in typical fashion....as usual no one seems to be listening....except for prennay for some reason...weird, even wayne seems to have drifted off into a world of his own...nothing new either, ...sang finishes reading, he looks around for a polite applause, none awaits him..tough luck, upon eyeing caesar asleep inside of his golf shirt, bateman decides to pipe up.)  bateman: (laughing..barely gets the words out)..lets see what cooper has to say about the passage ha ha ha  tompkins: (suddenly awakes): now Ian, we don't know what cooper is up to at night and thus what the ratioanle is behind his obvious lack of sleep therefore we cannot judge him. for all we know he may have been up late working on his family memoirs (not likely) ...right coop?....(no response) ....i'll take ur silence as a yes, i'll be excepting it any month now, -320 % as it stands so far, that is all.  (bishop and hudson snicker in the corner as watch horkins continually kick bateman, who won't stop trying to play footsies with him, horkypoo is fantisizing about someone else....chris continues to undress mr. tompkins with his eyes....he begins to squirm, the nude image of the physical specimen in his head obviously overcoming him, he poses a question)  horkins: mr. tompkins, if i invited u to...would u play with my log....i mean i mean post on my blog  (chris admires his smooth recovery...oh yeah)  tompkins: yes i have been regarding this "blog" woth curiosity since it originated, i keep tabs on such things in my spare time, i would love to post on ur site, perhaps draw some inspiration from my good friend bert...he looks like he had a tough weekend , would u straighten him out? ...now gentleman did everyone get the booklet that i stapled together for u last class..it took me over an hour...   horkins: nah i didn't get one mr. tompkins , could i grab ur package? ..i mean..... jesus....nvm ill just look at bateman's again..i mean...good god, um it looks like im gonna get the shaft here...(queitly to himself..) "i wish".....(horkins has freaked many people out)  tompkins: ok then chris, i don't liek to see u hard ..done by, i will go make a photocopy of mine for u, take a (2)5 min break  (ahh yess another classic english break begins  we all rush down to the ldh for ice cream as cooper launches into some strange story about what happened when his mom tried to help him with some practice techniques for his oral commentary.....yikes)

      Posting on the Blog; Revised Version.  A word of warning to the easily offended. The views of this play do not reflect the views of its author, it is a satirical depiction of English class and is meant to be taken lightly, and should in now way offend you. If you are easily offended then just turn away now, just don't complain to me about how you were offended or something like that.  Setting: WTs classroom on a hot spring day. We have started reading our family memoirs. Sang Ik is reading.  Sang Ik: Its when I was eating his dog that I realized that I shouldn't smyte him for confusing ping-pong with the artform of tennis. He then said, "Just get the hell away from me, you are so annoying!"  Cooper: (out of his sleep) What? Fuck you! I'm not gay, its perfectly heterosexual to go to a tanning salon and to tan in the nude. At least thats what my mom says.  WT: Very good Sang Ik, you said that you were from New Brunswick, yes? Alright then. (dramatic pause) in that case you get a 7++++. Your turn Scott and then we'll have Chris.  Nowers: Ok, I tool more of a narrative approach for mine. Here goes.... (reading from his assignment) My MDX rules! I wanted a Mustang but my girlfriend has one, and there's a problem with its Fuel Injectors so that if floor it, it messes up the engine and shit, which I can't have cause my summer job is going to be drag racing guys. I now can use my friend's Porsche 944-S2X5R77RR which is souped up beyond belief. It is tuned to perfection by some guy named Boris downtown. It now has over 7000 horsepower. I got pulled over by a cop once for speeding and I told him to fuck off because I am the best driver in the world and I can drive as fast as I want, no one can beat me!... Ok Im done.  Chris: Ok, I'm sort of improvising a bit cause I haven't handed mine in yet, so here goes... Its called a blog, short for weblog, it is so good it makes me crap my pants. I love it with my entire body (including my bum-bum). Everyone of my friends is a part of it. There has been one aspect of improvement that has eluded it for sometime now. Sir, Mr. Tompkins, we would be honored if you would join our 'blog' to post some of your insightful insight into the wonders of poetry and jazz.  WT: Well Chris that's a very interesting proposal. Unfortunately I am unable to do so, because of my damn hayfever.  And Scene   Well there you go Bishop, another revised edition, hopefully with ever passing English class I am able to create a new one that is even better than before.  Say it Bubbles, Say it! I ain't ever been so frisky in my entire life!

      Mr. Horkins,       I am becoming quit displeased with the lack of postage from luca and will. Luca has come up with two brilliant posts so I say we keep him around for a bit longer before terminating his rights to post if he doesn't contribute. Will doesn't post though. Maybe he is too busy smoking by himself on frybrook. We need to get circumcised -- CUT THE DICK! That is all for now. I'm going to eat dinner.  --bishy

      Bateman, great play. Suprisingly. You are a jerk but noticing all of the idiosyncrasies of our classmates. The only problem is that the play is supposed to be about Christopher Horkins asking WT to post. Not you, you insolent prick. Sorry I am supposed to gentle. Good show. 4 klondikes.

      Setting: WTs class on a hot spring day we are reading some Hemmingway.  Sang Ik: Gosh Sir, I think that this is some imagery about me being really annoying. Let me read, (loudly in a prepubesent voice) "Help me! Why am I so annoying?"  Cooper: No way I'm not gay.  WT: Very good Sang Ik you get a 7++++. And Cooper you are gay.  Nowers: (out of his sleep) Sir, I read this Sci-fi novel and it... well..... it sort of.... Its hard to explain.... Ummm.... (awkward pause) My MDX Rules! [he is refering of course to his Acura MDX]  Bateman: Sir I think it is a message about the complexity of the human species, how we are confined to the Earth and are never able to leave it. And on another note sir, there is a webposting site called a blog that several of the students are a part of and we would be honored if you would join to share some of your interesting insight.  WT: Damn this hay fever. Very good Scott you get a 7++++. In response to your query Bateman. Roses are red, violets are green, Bateman's a jerk, because he's hounding me like a fiend! And what are you talking about? You get a 2.  Well there you go Bishop. I hope that gives you another one to critique. Please be gentle, afterall it is a draft.  Say it Bubbles! I ain't ever been so frisky in my entire life!

      "A Modest Proposal" A comedy in six lines  Scene: R. Wayne Tompkins's English classroom just after his favourite english class has let out. Wayne sits in his big comfy chair looking lamentably at a pile of World Lit papers from one of his other less favourite classes. The class begins to leave as the "softcore" students (ie Bosco, Cooper, et al) rush to get to the LDH and score the last Klondike cone. The Hardcore students take the time to pack their bags and wish WT a happy weekend (it's a friday last period btw).  BATEMAN: Bye sir, have a nice weekend! By the way, are there any Jazz concerts or documentaries I would have no interest in but I'm asking you about to be a brown-noser going on this weekend?  WAYNE: Sadly no... I plan to spend my weekend writing poetry and perhaps listening to some old records of Neil Armstong... no one tickled the ivory plains like he did... mmmyes? Wait, that was Louie Armstrong. I should have know, I do have several paintings of him in my bedroom... and bathroom. Alright, have a good weekend Ian, I'll be expecting your Frost paper soon, myes? It's 50% off as it stands. Run along then. (Ian exits. Chris, the last student left in the class approaches him.)  CHRIS: Hey sir.  WAYNE: Ah, Mr. Horkins, my favourite student... ah it is a pleasure indeed. What can I do for you?  CHRIS: Well, uh... I was wondering. I have this website, a blog actually, weblog, It's like you make posts and stuff. A bunch of guys from class are a part of it. Like Hudson and Bishop, and er... Bateman... We were all wondering if maybe you would want to post sometimes. Maybe talk about what it's like to be a teacher, share some poetry, talk about jazz or what Jason Morris got on his Extended Essay... If you want the offer is on the table. Mr. Tompkins. For you to join our blog. So... do you uh... want to.... join our blog? Sir?  WAYNE: (rudely awakens) mwhat? sorry, drifted off there. What were you saying?  THE END.

      Giddyup peeps. What's goin on out in flounderville? I just got back from a weekend up at a friend's cottage with a few acquaintances. Much beer was drinken and much fun was had. That's all I can tell you for now. I want to very badly see the new matrix flick. And Wai is wai cool so i want to catch that trailer. I am so hungry right now. I could go for some LDH ice cream.  H-kins, I love you with all of my body (including my pee pee) because you put up that real ultimate UCC guy web page. It is so cool I feel it in my heart. I laughed at it without thinking twice. You have done us all a favour by making the site everyone has wanted to make. We are all just lazy except for you. You are so toight, so sexual.  I wonder how you would approach asking WT to post on this site? I now propose a contest. To the person who can write the bast six-line play about Christopher Horkins asking Robert Wayne Tompkins to join this blog, goes so muc respect and a great prize: Ice cream at the LDH from yours truly. The play can be funny, dramatic, cracked out or sexual, whatever gets u goin... So get writing, including you h-kins.   (for all of you people not in theatre, a six-line play is just that; a play with six lines of dialogue, and stage directions if you like. Make it toight and show us that u need not be a theatre genius like some of us to make toightness prevail.)  ---oh ma gad adios

      Yes, yes, yes. I am Ducks all the way right now. Disney is the new sports ownership titan. I predict that they will create a football team based on the movie "Remember the Titans" only it won't be called the Titans cause that names taken. It should be called the interracial superstars.  And the Matrix:Reloaded... wow. You all have to see this movie. It is sooooo sweet. I love it with all my body (including my pee pee). The fight scenes are beyond belief, and so what if the plot is complicated and hard to follow, it's the frickin' Matrix. And you gotta love the random, sex for the sake of sex, sex between Neo and Trinity. The scene where Neo is fighting like a gazillion Agent Smiths is (as my man Eric Estey would and did say) Fa'real. And they add a lot of depth to the plot, not just good vs. evil anymore. And that Jada Pinkett Smith... so smokin'. And the preview for the new Wai Choy movie FoolProof is worth the price of admission alone.   That's all I gotta say.

      oh horkpoo, i have really had to hold myself back from not rubbing it in about the Ducks win or more importantly.....the Wild loss, but after 2 days i can no longer keep it in. The ducks are going all the way, but i fear they may face their toughest opponent in the physical New Jersey Devils, it should be an interesting series. but hey "horks" (as luca so eliquently loves to call u) huge props for not jumping on the bandwagon with everyone else (besides me), u are truly a loyal fan....but ur with us now right?....u better be or else... Anyways on a separate note i am interested to hear how the new Matrix Movie was, upon attempting to see it at 10:30 on friday nite i found that it was sold out and went to catch X2 instead, which is a great movie, i enjoyed it. for any fellow x-men lovers like myself., its a good film, that story runs pretty deep especially if u catch everything that a naive x-men "fan" might miss. I would definitely suggest it. on a basketball note i was very happy to see the lakers fall last week and the mavericks prevail last night, the all texas - western conference semi-final is surely going to be a "dandy".  i hope everyone is enjoying their long weekend, the weather looks to be nice outside today finally so have a good day hudson go ducks

      Yo okay, so if you're tired of the  urlLink Ninja Site  (and I can't really see how one would be) then I have a new really funny site to check out.   urlLink HomeStarRunner.com - it's basically all sorts of funny shockwave flash stuff (cartoons, games, etc.) featuring a host of whimsical characters like Homestar and StrongBad. You just have to see it to believe it. You should check out the "Teen Girl Squad" shorts (f---in hilarious), strongbad emails, and "looking at a thing in a bag". All hilarious... and it comes reccomended by Scott "I hate everything" Nowers. So you know it's good!  Peace out

      JJ... I keep forgeting that my new nickname is Jumbo Jet because apparently I looked like a plane when I spread my arms out and ran across the street to catch the red light. So all you RJ (regular/regional Jets) better watch out.  Hey I saw the Matrix:Reloaded yesterday with Bateman, Will, George, and Estey and the rest of the school who were all in the theatre. And yes there is a preview for the long awaited Wai Choy movie FOOLPROOF. But no Wai was in sight, just a very suspenseful Ryan Reynolds and some chick in an elevator shaft... heheh shaft. Anyways we must demand more Wai! WAI!  Wai  more! get it? WAy? Wai? ah... africa.  And yes, for the first time since, uh... the leafs/flyers series of a couple weeks ago and the NJ/Tampa series, it seems I am wrong about the playoffs. But hey, you gotta admit that I did not hop on the bandwagon and abandon the Wild (and my buddy Dwayne). Now, however, I will be hopping back on the Ducks bandwagon. Wow. Can you believe this. The biggest market left in the playoffs is New Jersey. The Ducks are just unstoppable, like Kim Possible's sidekick Ron Stoppable. Two sweeps in one playoffs? All I have to say is this:  "What is this? The Oreo Line"- Racist Hawks player in D1 "This is a cardboard cut out of me. This is a fire in a barrel.   This is a carboard cut out of me in a fire in a barrel."- Coach Gordon Bombay in D2  "2 minutes for uh... roping."- Confused announcer in D2  "We're the Varsity. The only Hockey Team."- Preppy jock in D3  "Quack Quack Quack Mr. Ducksworth!"- Lawyer Gordon Bombay in D1  Wild in 9 and go ducks go.

      Yes it is true JJ. UCC kids can wrap their parents Jag around whatever tree they want! If you don't believe me, then you can ask Jamie McClean (when he gets back from Italy after failing the IB). And UCC guys always get what they want, even if it is being chauffered up to a friend's cottage in a brand new Hummer (aka H2 aka Rolo's ride) with their/his driver named 'Driver'. That is why UCC guys are so cool!  Well the wild couldn't get the series to 3-1 which means that they lost. Giggy once again with the help of Gordon Bombay, Hendrix hockey equipment, and Boney M's biggest fan defeated Dwayne Roloson and the Minnesota Wild.  I feel sorry for Minnesota, now that their hockey team lost, they have nothing to do. If you've ever been to Minnesota you would know that it is the most boring place in the world (not unboring as IKEA would suggest). They have a military base, an airport, a flat snow covered wasteland and now a mediocre hockey team who are out of the playoffs.  Say it Bubbles! I ain't ever been so frisky in my entire life!

      Well here it is, after probably the hackest scanning of my yearbook and cut and pasting of the view source window of my browser, I have created yet another parody of the wonderful Real Ultimate Power Ninja Site.  Check it out here:  urlLink Real Ultimate UCC Guys   And I'm adding Booth, if anyone has any complaints then you can trouble me for a glass of warm shut the hell up.

      You may notice John aka "J.Sp"'s name has disappeared from the FOL cult list to the left. Our literary genius has decided to take a leave of absence, a hiatus if you will. They say if you love something let it free. Hopefully our favourite sexophonic delight will be back in a few weeks, if not then: good luck and we love you.... in a totally platonic sense.  Take it easy.

      Wow, some cool dude from my mom's office (I bet he was a ninja he was so cool) came and set up a wireless cable internet deal in my house so now I have a super fast ultimate power internet connection. So anyways I just downloaded Bateman's favourite song "F---ing in the Bushes" and it is sweet. And yes, I spent most of French class drawing Ninjas and writing Ninja propaganda on a worksheet Mme. Lowndes gave us. It was pure hilarity.  Watch out for this week's Bluepage where I shut down Bobby Mcgarva...  Lates.

      Dude, seriously, that Ninja Site is the shit! I love the picture of that kid shoving a frisbee down his mouth to committ seppuku. And the letters from like real Ninja's that are just stupid like Sensei Richard or some shit and they say like "you dumb shit, Ninja's are not totally sweet as you claim. They are actually very gay and stupid. You fucking dumbass." Those are funny to read because they're just dumb. Ninja's are like totally sweeet.   So anyways...yeah. I just had English with WT-$. Apparrently Frost's "The Silken Tent" has no Phallic imagery eh bish? Honestly worst suggestion about Frost since Mike Stephens made up that shit about Clothos! CLOOOOOOOOOOTHOSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!  And no. Just no okay Hudson. The Wild will win (or at least score a goal) in the next game okay. Once it's 3-1, they will win. They've recovered from impossible situations before and they'll do it again. Dwayne is just having a little cold streak is all. But it's cool. He'll come back. He's like, a ninja! HIYAAAAAAA!  peace

      OK that post just before was totaly made up but also totaly sweet. Sometimes I look at horkypoo's website without thinking twce. One time, my friend was at this restauraunt and some dude dropped a spoon, and horkypoo snuggled the entire town.  So the ninja website is making me crap my pants. I can just picture some idiot like bateman sitting in his basement, naked with the heat turned up really high, just drinking coolaid and rubbing grease on himself while making a stupid website. God bateman why do u do shit like that? Fuck! Bateman why do you piss everyone off?  So John Spence loved the website so much that he crapped his pants. He has THE REAL ULTIMATE POWER for sure. Spence is cool, and by cool I mean totally sweet! Spence has no ass though.  bye

      A short story in Ms. Gravlejs TOK class ....(before reading this i strongly suggest u check out www.realultimatepower.net and read some of the "pump up" stories)  Hudson: Man having laptops for TOK is awesome  Bish: Yeah its soooo awesome  Hudson: Man that ninja sight is hilarious  Bish: More like totally sweet, i felt like "popping 16 boners" when i saw it.  Hudson: I know dude, as if u were looking at some totally hot babe, so hot that smoke was coming out of her ears.  Bish: Yeah dude, thats like sooo totally sweet ......Man i feel like folding a frisbee in half and shoving it into my mouth  Hudson: Thats just weird....  Bish: No man thats just seppuku, the art of killing oneself. let me explain Step 1    Get a frisbee from the store or friend. Step 2    Clean the Frisbee. Step 3    Make sure your parents arent around Step 4    Put something slippery on it, like butter or cream. Step 5    Get really super pissed. Step 6    Fold the Frisbee hard (this is crucial) Step 7    Keep folded and insert Frisbee into mouth hard. Step 8    Push hard until you cant see it. Step 9    Wait. Step 10  Die  If you succeed, everybody will be like Holy Crap!   Hudson: hey bishy, ur scaring me man....  Bish: im a ninja...  Hudson; No ur not  Bish: hudson.....HI YAAAA   hudson just lost his head

      Yeah, DC-Unit... I guess he falls in under the "anyone but brooker category" so enjoy his posting insight.  So anyways today has been probably the hottest posting day on this blog in recent memory (I think this is my 4th today). The Blogometer is off the scale! So I thought I would take some time to announce a new thing. Bish came up to me today and suggested the next step in Flounder Online evolution:  merchandise!   I took a gander over at  urlLink a little site called Cafe Press.com . And apparently we can create and buy and sell all sorts of cool stuff with a Flounder Online logo on it for free (well if you wanted to buy it it would cost some money... but the set up is free!!!). And I'm not just talking T-shirts, there is a lot of cool shit we could get. Who would not want a Flounder emblazoned Beer Stein? Or perhaps an FOL lunchbox? What's the perfect gift for a special ladyfriend? A Flounder Online Thong of course! (okay maybe not that last one). Dude, this is serious man... SERIOUS. Intense. We are definitely setting this up.  In other news the lucky ducks will run out of luck tonight and lose to the mighty Minnesota Wild and the power of Dwayne "Roli Poli the Goalie" Roloson and Marian "I have a girl's name" Gaborik. Dude the Wild will pull this off. If they can get down 3-1, they  will  win the series, it's a garuantee. I love the ducks and my homey Uncle Al (who btw is the greatest) lives down there in anaheim but man, the original Ducks played in Minneapolis and wore green sweaters and as much of a fan of the ducks I am, I refuse to jump on that bandwagon and abandon my Wild. Go Wild Go. Wild in 7. Goodnight.

      Hey Guys, DC-unit's in the house,  First of all I commend bishy fishy for his amazingly accurate and insightful list of UCC's most beautiful men.  However I would like to use my first post to voice my one displeasure with the list, there was a certain lack of minorities present on this list.   I just think it would have be more representative had the list included people of races other than caucasian. Surely beautiful guys such as the Asian sensations Charles "Chuckles" Chung and Shu "The Shoe" Xie should have at least been in the top ten. And perhaps the greatest oversight of all was not putting aspiring actor Wai "I've got my own website" Choy.   Come on guys, these people are too beautiful to be left off the list, DC-Unit.

      Yo what up?  Okay so I have to talk about the play that went down last night starring myself, Matthew "Theatre my life, and Gucci makes it worthwhile" Cowie and Alex Richardson. LONESTAR. Part of the BSS One Acts 3 night play series put on by the lovely OAC drama students over at the Maroon castle on Lonsdale Road. But seriously this play was the shiznit, it was off the heezy fo sheezy, one Will Dick (theatre coinnosseur with unruly hair) it was "The best High School theatre I have ever seen, and better than a lot of professional theatre". Of course a big big big big BIG UPS goes to our fabolous director the lovely Carrie Smith, and my fellow actors who made it great, and our biggest fan the big westizzle himself Eric "The Big E" Estey.   Speaking of Plays, I just had the privelege, and honour I might add, to read a play written by one Thomas Bittner. Full of a splendrous vocabulary of "nigga"s, "fo shizzle"s and "yo whattup"s it was a work of art. I suggest you all read it ASAP.  Spence has apparrently signed up our "cult" as a team for his bowling against wifebeater tournament as "Team Horkypoo" sponsored of course by Flounder Online.  Okay as for the peeps who may be posting here soon.  Tapscott- could be fun, maybe, might require some censhorship Stephens- er... no (malice is not appreciated here) and I don't want any "I'm a good blogger!" Jack- well if I put him here he'll just ramble on about how I'm a "non personis gratis" (basically latin for shithead) because I switched parties at OMP Schnackary- well, yeah, he's been known to uh... cybersex... nuff said Teddy G- my biggest Rap Nemesis... online rap battles, I can see it now, a definite yes Harris- He's got me shook, so he should get in this blog and get ready... to post Brooker "Busy Hands" Belcourt- apparrently he "doesn't want" to post anymore... yeah... sure Brooker, I know you would sell your soul to post! YOUR SOUL!!!!!  That's about enough for now. Laaaaaaaaaaatees

      What up to all my flounder online pals, the posts continue to exceed my expectations....except for you...bateman, your's fall short on a consistent basis, i agree with bish, people are gonna start asking questions if u keep that McKell act up ...a la Doug Brown....."what is ian trying to cover up with his seemingly "funny comments".......hmm intriguing... anyways on a seperate note my Ducks keep winning and to be honest i am growning tired of people jumping on the bandwagon, altho horkins has been criticized for his stupid decision to ride with the Wild and Dwayne Roloson?..."yeah cus u knew who he was before the second round.." ..AT least horkins stays loyal to his squad and doesn't start to roll with the ducks just because they keep winning. enough said. word up to bish for his "toight" (love it) suggestions for new possible posters, i like harris, tapper and jack....ted might be a problem....shakes, affects typing but i love the guy and would love to have him on board. its up to u tho horkypoo, but most importantly Busy Hands Brooker should not recieve privledges, why is he so selfish anyways ...oh brooker when will u learn.  i just realized something, there is a bunch of people that i wouldn't mind bashing on this site....but don't u think it's awkward when u see them at school afterwards? spence aka the probabation king....are u with me on this? i guess u gotta be careful these days what is the deal for u, 13 strike rule, 5 more and ur out buddy. Bish, i feel u on those horkins stares, i think he is definitely undressing u but consider urself lucky, u should see the ones that he gives poor Mr. Tompkins, no wonder horkypoo cant stop smiling during that class, in his mind, WT is practically naked at the front of the room, and on a seperate subject, do u have the sneaking suspiscion that mathers wants to kill all of us?...yikes well thats it for me, oh by the way has any one seen Adam Cooper ? missing in action...gotta get those assignments in there coop see ya hudson

      Unfortunately, Bateman is right for once. The ducks will win. Horkins you are a big doofus. But Bateman, your oddly homoerotic affinity for Steve Mckell is starting to scare me. You know pretty much everything about the man, down to the colour and type of his skivies. You keep talking about this 'emaciated kenyan runner' line like it is some sort of profound proclomation by jesus who has finally come back to earth. Mr. McKell is definately not jesus. Maybe moses, but definately not jesus.   In other news, I am finding it very difficult to write a play ing this playwriting unit. John 'ponton prize' Spence is as dry as my last turd. Chaffed my bumhole badly. Neither of us can come up with any gold. Maybe a play about ovaltine. Hey maybe I got something there. Anyhow, Horkins keeps giving me the looks across english class that I don't know what to make sense of. It seems like he is undressing me with his eyes. It makes me all hot and bothered. OK so homoerotic references aside, I would definately like to snuggle with Horkins. I do not know a mmber of the UCC community who wouldn't. Speak now or forever hold your piece. I guarentee Spence is holding his right now.   I am also wondering about who h-kins should add to this blog. A few ideas have been floating around in my noggen.   1. Tapscott  2. Stephens (so we could make fun of him)  3. Jack (weirdo in FY)  4. Zach Schwarz (ditto)  5. Teddy Gotlieb  6. Ian Harris  7. Anyone BUT Brooker "busy hands" Belcourt   Feedback is definately welcome. Let's narrow it down to a final three and then make them fight to the death, or arm wrestle etc...   That's all I got.   --adios

      Well I went to Norval today and spent a good three hours freezing my ass off (wait sorry, freezing my behind off). Anyway, the funniest part of the trip was in the morning, when Greatest Big Bertha (aka Tapscott) could not fins his permission form on the bus, he was told to leave by Mr. Turner because of this. When we arrived at Norval Mr. Alex Ferchette (aka the benchwarmer who is on an athletic scholarship to UCC) opened his binder only to find Greatest Big Bertha's permission form. The truth is, its only funny cause its Tapscott. And as general precautions prior to our departure to Norval, we asked Michael Stephens (aka Clothos) if he had gone to the bathroom (you never can be too careful).  Anyway Horkins (aka Iced Cream (softserve naturally)), the Wild will lose to the hands of the Anahiem Mighty Ducks because the power of J.S. Gigure combined with the offensive and defensive pairing of Gordon Bombay (aka Emillio Estevez aka EMILLIO!) and Steve McKell (aka Gordon Bombay aka Goodyear aka 'the man who does not look like an emaciated Kenyan runner' aka Boney M's biggest fan) is incredibly hard to beat.  Anyway Spence, that should provide enough 'cannon fodder', as you so eliquently phrased it, for your blogging needs.  Ok say it Bubbles! I ain't ever been so frisky in my entire life!

      So... apparently after our amazingly excellent studies teacher (who is btw, the best teacher ever, wink wink) Coach Dr. Steve "the best teacher ever" Griffin called me "horkypoo" about ten times in class and informed me of his surfing of the "horkypoo site" it appears we have entered the knowledge of the UCC faculty who are all amazing people and we salute you. What up G-dog?  Anyways after my amazing 11/14 on that pop quiz (I know I am a genius, I didn't even know how to do most of the questions... hahaha) I am prepared to take back my crown as bestest studies student ever, maybe I could be better if I started doing the homework? You'd like that wouldn't you Mr. G? I'll consider it.  So anyways the posting will be super ultra censored from now on a la Hudson's last post. Maybe we should get some posting priveleges for the faculty? Who wouldn't want G-Prime and WT on the blog?  Well, All I have left to say is this:  WILD IN SIX... I'm sorry the Ducks are a bandwagon team and I cheer for the underdogs. Dwayne, if you're out there, I want you to know I am your biggest fan. You rule.  peace

      Yeah, Go Ducks Go indeed! And now that the the Mighty Ducks (my favourite remaining team) has won their conference semi-final, and Ottawa (hate those bastards) have beat the Flyers (the team I hated least of the two) I have but one team to cheer for as the conference semis come to a close:  Yes my friends the Minnesota Wild. It's time to get WILD, the crowd goes WILD, Minnesota totally raped Vancouver like some kind of WILDman in game 5. Hopefully they can become the first team to come back from 3-1 Twice in a row! Wouldn't that be WILD? yes it would. A certain Matthew Cowie would love if his fave Canucks would win. But I beg to differ. Aside from the "cheer for the closest team to you" rule, and the fact that Brent Sopel looks like a girl, Minnesota is clearly the better and more physical team. "44 it's called the Todd Bertuzzi and looks like he's gone lose-y."- new lyrics to Todd Bertuzzi song. Dwayne Roloson is my hero.  And speaking of the Sens. Look for "The Cup Will Never Go To Ottawa" next time y'all are on KaZaA (sic?). It is a hilariously clever dis of the crappy Ottawananian hockey team to the tune of Adam Sandler's "The (C)Hannukah Song"  "Hossa and Havlat-awa will soon be playing golf a lot-awa, what the heck else rhymes with Ottawa? Not much of a lot-awa. They think they have a shot-awa but they must be smoking pot-awa. Cause the Stanley Cup will never go to Ottawa!"- just one clever lyric from the song.  English assignment eh Hudson? Yeah, I'm not going to be handing it in tommorrow. Maybe I'll do it a day late a la my Field Study, or perhaps several days late a la most of my assignments this term... 3rd term laziness... there goes my point total...  Well... take it easy folks  catch ya on the flipside. whatever that means.  And yes, buy that man some Axe (preferably Phoenix scent, so scentilatingly sumptuous...) a leaving class gift perhaps?

      Greetings. Well tomorrow I am going to Norval for a glorious systems field trip. It shall be grand; led by the grand pubah, Dr. Hamr and Norm, resident psychopath. John Spence who is on super-ultra-high-conduct probation will be there as well. I hope he doesn't do anything to further his probation.  On another note, I'm not going to leave that horrendous theatre project alone. It's crapiness shall be eternally remembered. The only reason I like to bring it up again, is that Ricci is such an annoying keener at school and the fact that his groupl did so shittily on this project makes me laugh until i soil myself. Haha soil.  I really like the word 'loins'. It's brilliant. Can you say "My loins are on fire" without cracking a smile? Didn't think so. Something also hilarious is Johnny's new solumn in  Convergence , 'Joe IB.' Very amusing. Very toight. Very sexual.  I have to appoligise to people for continuosly saying toight and stuff. I'm trying to quit cold turky but i crave it, i need a hit every now and again. I'll try and drop the smack soon i promise. Ahh i need a hit right now. Toight like a toiger. Ahhhhhhhhhh it feels good.

      Okay, let's just leave that theatre project alone. Yes, me bateman and ricci's Set Design sucked. Yes, Ricci did totally fuck up the scale, and yes we didn't really act as a team, and yes to the max I slacked off and did as little work as possible on this project (hey, I did our research package, that netted a respectable %73, which is more than what we'll end up with overall, and i provided the glue gun) because my work ethic has gone to absolute shit in the third term. But hey, do I deserve to fail this project? No. Then why hasn't Bateman gone and changed my percentage of the mark? Because he's a stubborn little bastard. Now go change it before I kill you!  Just jokes man... except I  do  want you to change the mark... PLEASE! (I deserve a bit more than 20%)  Anyways I plan to move on and get a 7 on the playwriting unit which I am doing with Matthew "I am the theatre program... and I wear a gucci belt" Cowie. Seriously our play will rule. But I can't tell you anything else because you will all steal our genius ideas. Speaking of plays, John Spence has agreed to post an interesting six line play about me and the aforementioned Gucci-sporting individual. It is hilarious. Almost as hilarious as that great show, Clone High. Loved by TV coinosseurs like John Spence, Adam Cooper, and Alex Hood the kid who is on Arthur and Beyblade.  And yes The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim freaking rule. J-S "The Man" Giguere last night earned his first ever in history playoff shut out as the Mighty Ducks beat the Dallas Stars 1-0 to go 3-1 in their series. Now all the Ducks have to do is put it away for good. Let me just say "Quack Quack Quack" I'll see you at the pond.   "You look like you just got out of zee shower" -The Old dude from D2 to Coach Gordon Bombay of Team USA hockey upon seeing his new hairstyle.  PS Oh I forgot to mention, a certain Brooker Belcourt has requested posting priveleges on this blog... and I was going to give them to him... HOWEVER, it seems he has some very let's just say  busy hands  which he cannot keep to himself. So unless he can refrain from assaulting my person, then he will never get posting priveleges on the world famous Flounder Online. That is final!

      Yeah WT's comments were a little harsh, he said that it seemed as if I had not prepared for my oral exam.  But his chillness factor makes up for the harshness, I still hope he's my teacher next year.  Anyways this is just a quick post.  Yeah the Cooper nickname poll was just a joke, I'm surprised no one commented on the shitiness of my rap/poem the second half will still come tonight, all students in that class that i can remember will be rapped even myself. Well got to go to "chill" with my homies at the club.  Payce!!!!!!!

      Well I got my report card today, and the comments that I got from Wayne have pissed me off. But since most people on the blog like WT, I am just going to say this, why don't you make like a tree and fuck off.  Yeah something interesting to pass your way, Dave Phelan has been spending a rather large amount of time with my fellow lifeguard Megan (the one from North Toronto) during extended care, which is nice of him granted, however I wonder if Dave knows that she has a boyfriend, in which case (if he does not) he has wasted massive amounts of time. Another interesting bit from UCC this summer is that ex-employee Mr. Barton (I was told who he was today, remember him vaguely), first the guy has really let himself go, he is now McKell sized to put it into preportion, and not only that but he is a pretty big dick to all of the councellors in Jr. Basketball (ie. Morassutti, Barter, Phelan, etc.) and bitches to us lifeguards about what should be done and all this other shit. I'll bring him some nutri-grain bars next, dick.  Cooper, you should have doodled on the guy, like "Tell your husband not to pick up our employees when he comes to Cheaters" (or some other Etobikoe stripclub). I will not start a new poll about which nickname is better dude, come on you can do much better than that. The Fourth thing is that you have ingested more crap in the past month than I have in my entire life, and the fifthe thing is that you shouldn't drive while masterbating (just playin man that story was jokes).  Well I hope tomorrow turns out to be better than today, I seem to have problems on Mondays.  "And I fucking, need you more than ever......" - Old School

      First off, I'm sorry and I feel shame.  5 days since my last post, since my entrance into the blog I have been able to update on a consistent basis, but over the last 5 days I have no excuse for not posting other than creative bankruptcy.  But never fear my friends for my mind has hit upon a mine of information as large as Harris's private stash.  I am going to talk about 3 different things, firstly: a near accident with my car (not the old lady, I have no recollection of that event), some rap/poem rhyming and lastly and lastly a hillarious story from work :)  Look at the format boys!  Give 'em somethin' that they want to see and hint at it in the intro, oh yeah!  English baby. WHOOOOOO!!!  Oh it's true, its damn true. (KA best ever boys)  I have no idea about this old lady incident, sounds more like my friend GC (just think about it you'll know who that is) I'm never getting in the car with him.  Anyways, this story starts about 1 month ago or so.  So far on this day we've inhaled our fair share of a foreign substance (just guess) and there were about 7 people in my car and I was driving them all home.  I'm driving along Eglinton and I'm trying to figure out which way to go and I finally decide to take the 427 South to drop off my friend's girl.  As I'm heading towards the on-ramp and I kind of phase out (side effect of my favourite substance) and I did not realize the speed that I was taking the ramp, I did not think about this until I see the suggested speed for the ramp...   40 kmh and I look at the speedometer.  "OH SHIT!!!"  I am going 80 kmh and I'm in a 2000 explorer (flips easily) I'm not thinking too well so as I'm turning on the ramp i try to brake and slow down, but this just causes me to skid.  I'm thinking I'm gonna roll the car off the road and kill everyone in the car, but suddenly the tires catch again and I'm back on my way.  I am able to calm down and take every one home, safe and sound (luckily) and I found out that a couple of the guys in the car were not wearing seatbelts.  From now on when I'm not at 100% I use cruise control constantly.  Better safe than sorry from now on.  I'm just happy I survived that.  Now to head to a more upbeat topic,  THE RAP STYLINGS OF COOPLANDER!!!!!!  The Class by the John  Take a look down the hall There's some shit goin' down y'all Better turn right or you'll hit the crapper The john's for the playah haters  Take a look in Who's that? Horkins What the hell is he looking at? Shit is he illin'? My bad, he's just chillin'  Yo Masterbateman let me hit wat u smokin. Hey wait that ain't fo tokin!! That shit is just wak! You some kind of hack!? Quit that shit or u get whacked  There's khristianson and balint Can u imagine them yellin' They can talk like a mute bitch  Don't miss Nows and Wals, they the rowers They sleep like Da Vinci, an hour a day for these workers  Can you see Fan the Man? He Uh knows how to uhh.. sleep, uhh...  part 2 coming soon boys I still have to get to sleep and this is all off the top of my head don't worry Tompkins will have a rap about him  My funny story from work occured last week, it was about 2 o' clock and I was waiting up top for people to come in for their tee times and for people to come off the course.  Well this guy comes in driving his cart by himself, swerving from side to side coming within inches of the wall.  He gets out of his cart and tries to take his bag off of his cart but cannot.  I come over and help him and he starts talking to my co-worker.  He goes on about how the ball was evil and was cursed by Damon the devil's son.  That was about all I caught as his sluring kept him from talking intelligently.  We looked in his cart and saw about 8 cans of Canadian and 4 smirnoff ices.  This guy was trashed.  We asked if we could call a cab for him but he said no and took his bag and stumbled to his car about halfway through the parking lot out of my view.  About 2 hours later at 4 I am taking the limo (extended cart for driving lots of people around) and I see his car still there.  I drop off the people at the clubhouse and I drive back out to this guy's car.  It appeared that he had passed out.  From his waist up he was inside his trunk while the other half of his body was outside of the trunk.  Apparently he had passed out while changing as he had no shirt on and his pants were only half on.  He was breathing, just not moving.  I tried waking him up.  I nudged him... nothing.  I tried to say something to him... nothing.  I slapped him... nothing.  I threw tees at him (ok now I was just having fun)  Eventually I left, because I had to get back to work.  I was closing that day so I didn't leave until around 10 o' clock that day.  The parking lot is empty... except for two cars... my car and... the drunk guy's car.  He was still there, passed out in his car.  I drove away and he was gone the next day.    See you boys later, I will never leave you for that long ever again, by the way Bateman a good poll would be which one of my nicknames is the hippest: Cooplaner, Coopster, Coop, Rock (co-workers nickname for me) and Ceaser, if you think of any more you can add them.  Just a suggestion.  By the way send your feedback to bateman, make up some imaginative topics for polls or lists we can always use your help, sometimes everyone hits a roadblock creatively.  "That's some bomb shit, Forcheesssiii!!!" A friend (it's not me seriously)  alkjfal;kjjajfakljfkjbyejkajf;lkja;lkbyejaklsjf;lkseealksfayafsafas (can you find the goodbye in there?)

      Ok I am sorry that no one has posted in a while, basically I've been hanging out eating chicken fingers and getting drunk, but it is a two way street guys come on. Our third lifeguard joined us at the pool earlier this week, and apparently she is """hot""", now I find Megan cute just like most of the other guys, but Bishop you gotta tell el-dawg and all the other Baseball negros that they can't stop by the pool whenever they want just to say hi man, we've been getting in so much shit with Badali lately it isn't funny. Now I just came up with a way, way, way, awesomer idea than anything I've ever done before. Since it is summer, and that usually suggests long weekends, ice cold beer, and last but certainly not least, ladies in bikinis basking on the dock/beside the pool, this is why I have decided to start the   Babe of the Week  . A weekly feature, profiling one of the ladies of summer once per week. So without further adeiu, the woman we love this week is...   Cameron Diaz   Is this any great surprise? The star of this summer's hottest movie (except for The Shape of Things, and The Day They Killed a Dove of course) Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. If you did not see the first Charlie's Angles, you missed out, I just say it again on Citytv this week, and I must say that it is on the top ten greatest movies of all time, and Cameron Diaz makes the entire thing. Yes the movie is an utter piece of crap, but it's essentially Baywatch with guns and fast cars, a win win win! (just like Fastlane). Personally my favourite piece of theatrical drama featuring Ms. Diaz, is The Mask, so hot, so hot. Anyway tune in next week for 'the babe of the week.'   Now for some particularlly interesting feedback....   Someone who knows Cooper writes....  With Horkypoo gone, the site is dying. According to the dates, its been 4 whole days without any posts. I don't know how you expect to keep your readers if you don't keep posting. Come on Cooper, tell me about how you got high and ran over an old woman with your explorer!   Cooper......... (and yeah, my bad about the 4 day shit).    Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny - Jack Handy

      As our beloved JJ departs tomorrow morning for camp, I have decided to exercise my admin powers to the max, by doing that feedback thing.... yeah.   Cowie says.....   Bateman (thats me),  What's up man? It's Cowie.  I would have posted, but my computer at the cottage is screwed up - I can't log in and post, so therefore my only contact is through the feedback system. Here is a funny (and true) story Our good buddy, Nick "punching bag" Kypreaos (or however the hell you spell his last name) had all of his game worn jersy's stolen from out of his car. Some of them (specifically his Rangers jersey) is valued at $1,300. It's true. I read it in the National Post. Also man, I haven't voted for myself at all in the poll - I honestly just got on the the computer.  Take care buddy, I hope work is going well. Cowie  Well Cowie it is nice to hear from you, being up there in the northern paradise that is known as Muskoka (bastard). Well thats what happens when you don't put the anti-theft deterent device known as 'the club' on your 1982 Pontiac 6000e, you get your hockey jerseys stolen. And as for the job, well lets say that yesterday didn't run as smooth as it should have, lets leave it at that. Seven down only 43 more to go, payday is now only three days away...   Next caller....   This site is not funny anymore. All you talk about is golf, nobody cares about how you shot? ok?   I must admitt I agree, hopefully this will be a wake up call to people to stop saying that they crossed the street and arrived ok (i did it 17 times today by the way, think about it) come one, I know the FOL members can do a better job than this golf shit. However JJ can still do it cause it is afterall his 'online diary'. Or some shit like that.   Insightful writes....   I have a feeling 353 people haven't actually taken the poll....Maybe you fools should make it so you can only post once.  Cooper has the best job because all he does is tan and "d"-"rugs"   Well the Coopster has been known to abuse Vagi-clean now and then, but you probably know more than I do. But in all seriousness, don't abuse the polls, I am trying to get rid of this new one but it's pretty hard, and we all know that Cowie's job is probably the "pharealest" cause he gets to party with Rachel Howse (so hot right now and probably will be for a very long time to come) and makes an insane amount of green, yes even more than Rosie O'Donnell, Cal.   Well keep sending it in, and stay off the chems.

      Well guys, this is it... unless I find time to post later tonight or tommorrow morning (doubtful seeing as I'll probably be watching the BET Awards), my last post before leaving for camp. I'll probably watch my last episode of Train48 for a month in about an hour... that is truly a great show. I'll miss it like I'll miss posting on the blog. But you guys have to make sure of one important thing: keep posting and keep the blog alive. We have a good thang goin on here, dont let it die. And Cooper, whatever man just save me some of Roy's favourite stuff. Bateman will be a good admin. Spence and Hudson should start posting again because they've fallen off the the face of the earth as far as I know. Don't forget to send me cool stuff (not innapropriate stuff!), the address you may find at  urlLink ponacka.com  just add my name at the top of the address. I hope you all have a great summer if I don't see you. Shout me out in August if you want to jam. Until then, my peeps, it's not goodbye just So-Long.  peace

      Sooo close!!!  So god damn close!!  I had my best round of golf today and I was this close (hands inches apart) from doing something amazing.  I shot a 75 today!!  That's 4 over par!!  If it wasn't for a double bogey on the 2nd hole (the easiest on the course) I would have shot a 73, a score I can only hope to reach (for now).  I had some problems in that round tho'.  I pissed off some old ladies in front of my group because I hit into them. I tried to explain that I don't usually hit my 3 wood 300 yards but they were not listening.  I felt shame.  Anyways I actually birdied the hole that I felt shame on and I birdied the toughest hole on the course # 7.  Also birdied #11.  I'm surprised I didn't even birdie a par 5, crazy cooky.  I went 37 38 for a 75!!  I played again at 4:00 from the back tees and I almost did as well, I shot 79, but I shot 41 on the front nine, that means I shot 38 on the back, why can't I put two of those together?  Front really sucked ass, but on the back I went: birdie, double bogey, par, birdie, bogey, par, par, bogey, par.  On 15 and 16 I lipped out for birdies, but my putting was pure gold.  This is just to let you boys out there know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, a nearly perfect round can be had.    By the way Geoff Mcleod did win his Canadian Junior Golf Association tournament in Cambridge at Whistlebear, with a 71 - 75 on a par 72 course.  Good for him.  I can't say that I'm the best of friends with fire hair (red hair joke), but I respect all the work and time he has put in to become a better golfer.  Once again congrats to him for setting the bar for all us hacks.  Horkins I'll see what I can do, but my opening for a party with no parental supervision is small.  Only two weeks and during those two weeks I think that you are at camp, but I could throw you a little homecoming jam when you make your return.  I'm sure the blog fans will be starving for Flounder posts.  There may be a party while you are gone, but don't worry, you'll get your just desserts afterwards.  Very comfortable right now because I just put in my air conditioner and I love it.  With the weather like it is right now I need it, just don't think that I'm complaining, I love the weather.  Peace out

      Cooplander, so true... playing well through a whole 18 hole round is a doozie of a challenge. Usually by the end you'll be getting tired and start fading off, and then there's just the dreaded inconsistencies we all face (I shot 10 on a par 3 once...) But you know I am not playing golf for another month... which could be seen as good or bad. And coop, y'all better not be thinkin of havin' a jam wit'out me! If you can hold it til I get back.... do it.  And Bateman sure makes my camp seem like some kind of Ashley Chivers adventure island but it's not. Okay there may be all guys, but it's like the male bonding (in a good way) and friendship you know and like that dude just likes to skinny dip it's what he does. The kids don't have to go naked or whatever. I got nothin'... that dude is pretty weird when it comes to that aspect of camp life, and most others actually. He's like... the 50's or something. I heard when Dave and Jamie Mclean got kicked out from camp like 2 years ago he gave this big anti-drug rant and was like "there will be none of the dope here!" Ah... I cannot wait to go to camp. 2 days gentlemen.  "Can you quiet down lady? I can't hear myself slurp!" -Cal from UnderGrads (a grade A show, coopster)

      Hello boys and gals!! Sorry for my absence over the last couple days, but I had a post written up on Thursday, and then my computer froze and I could not recover the material and as it was 2:00 AM I did not feel like rewriting it.  I was dissapointed because it was a pretty good post.  I might rewrite some of it at the end of the post.  Anyways, with golf seemingly taking over the blog as the new cult subject (similar to the 6 line plays.)  I'd like to put in my two cents on my current golfing situation.  I golfed Saturday and for 11 holes I ripped up the course.  I'll give you a short run down of my best drives.  1st hole - 255 yard 3 wood.  3rd hole - 290 yard driver.  4th hole - 290 yard 3 wood (its off a cliff).  6th hole - 283 yard driver.  7th hole - 260 yard driver.  9th hole - 230 yard 3 wood.  11th hole - 270 yard 3 wood.  Now it starts to go downhill, 13th hole - 230 yard 3 wood.  16th hole - 230 yard driver.  17th hole - 240 yard 3 wood.  Now these may mostly look like good drives, but every hole that I did not mention was a very dissapointing drive, not succesful, like sand traps, rough and the dreadful OTHER!  Anyways I was 2 over after the first 9 holes, then it was a scramble with my mother, who is usually a very good golfer with a 17 handicap.  Unfortunatley she was battling a swing change, a sore shoulder (past torn rotater cuff) and a sore wrist.  This resulted in us placing mediocrely in the junior/senior tournament.  Too bad because we have placed very well in this tournament in the past.  Too bad.  If I'd played well in the second half of the round I could have carried her on Saturday.  Ah well. I tried to show in this paragraph to show how difficult it is to have a round where you play well for a full 18 holes.  Just to join in the group frustration of everyone else with golf.  Bateman, the pro golfer/hockey player was AK's character.  You know, the one about the guy with the perfect life who kills himself.  So you just insulted AK.  For shame.  AK is untouchable cool.  It seems you have a problem with Ricci, since you're insult was aimed at Ricci not AK.  Keep your venom to yourself J-Roc.  You still cool tho'. Forcheesi!!  Cool jam at my friend Lawson de Jamie's house.  There was a supreme lack of chickitas, but there were many things to entertain us though (you know, things that Roy likes to have fun with :)  We ended up running around St. Georges which is in his backyard.  Jokes boys.  Place was like two minutes from my house so I didn't even need to hook up a cabbie for me and my homies.  OK.  I said I would do and I will.  This is the best part of my erased post on thursday.  Here we go.  Taken straight from Thursday's post.  Yeah we had this tournament at Royal Woodbine today (Wednesday), and it was a lot of the sports media in Toronto.  People like Hazel Mae, Jim Van Horne, Jim Hunt (the Fan 590), Greg Sansone and a bunch of little jockeys from Woodbine Racetrack.  The funniest thing all day though was my interaction with Steve Kouleas (I don't care how his name is spelt), anyways, he pulls up in his BMW and I come up to his window to find out who he is and to get his clubs to get them on a cart.  I come up to his window and say "Hi sir! How are you doing today?"  "Great"  "Can I get your name sir?"  "You don't know who I am?" (Look of confusion from me) "I work for the Score?"  (Still don't know who he is) "I'm Steve Kouleais, sports anchor for the Score. I can't believe you don 't know my name!"  I'm just sitting there with my mouth hanging open wondering what the fuck (sorry) was wrong with this guy.  I say fine and I take his clubs and I hope I never see him again.  He was probably the most egotistical guy I have ever met.  At least Jim Van Horne made up for Not Kooleaius.  Van Horne was totally Van Damn Good!!    That's it.  I'd like to give a shout out to our fellow student at UCC Geoff Mcleod.  On Saturday he was leading the CJGA event at Whistlebear after shooting a one under 71, hope he wins.  So early congrats to the Mcleodinator.  So hot right now (in a totally pletonic way)  I think I may throw a party in the next month for all of the Flounder peoples.  A cool pool party with lots of Roy's favourite tings, (we'll send a helicopter to pick him up from camp)  I'll keep y'all posted on the p to the arty.  Time to sleep now. I have to be up at about 7:30 today to work out to get some abs, play some golf and then tan so I don't get the dreaded golfers tan (you know where you're arms and head are red and the rest of your body is pasty white, nasty ugly) Its just like "earth to ugly tan guy." And then he's all like "earth to me guy I need to tan."  "Earth to guy, yeah you do."  "Earth to me, ok"  "Hey guy do I look more naked like this?  Or like this guy?"  Cal - Undergrads   I had to bring the quote back from the dead since I had yet to include an Undergrads quote. For Shame Cooplander.  For Shame.  Catch y'all on the flip side.     FORCHEEESSSSIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Wow, once again the FOL readers prove to be of the highest degree of intelligence. They can actually decipher that I am a complete dumbass. Wow, when I grow up I wanna be as smart as the people who say that I am dumb, or a worm, or a professional golfer/hockey player who ends up killing himself and change my name to Richard Cory (aka Ricci's bum chum character dude). And yes, if you haven't figured it out yet, I am really dumb. Thank you JJ for the admin privaleges,  hoinestly , I never expected this honor. It is that time of year again when we are able to seperate the hardcore Torontonians from the not-so hardcore Torontonians and the cottagers. Matthew "Bateman's Furberry Visor is so out its in" Cowie left for his cottage this previous Friday, and now JJ is leaving for his beloved, albeit strangely homo-erotic, all boys camp for the majority of the summer. Apparently the camp owner goes skinny dipping with the young kids in the morning and in order to entice them to go skinny dipping they give them cake and ice cream, its like Hansel and Greddle but they are at camp, they're not lost, and the old lady's house is some horny distgusting old man. Sounds like a top notch episode of "are you afraid of horny old men", he's not a catholic priest is he?  Anyway, no one has drowned or even needed to be rescued yet, el-dawg (aka Elliot) is a chilled dude, so are Davy Crockett and Bishop, the Baseball councellors, and Bishop's group of half naked wart riddled children were like 15 minutes late and it was Erin's fault (aka my flirty fellow lifeguard who does as little work as humanly possible).

      Okay guys, today I had a better day on the course, I managed not to shoot any triple bogies and actually come off the course with a decent score (105) unfortunately, my score from yesterday prevented me from taking home any hardware, but hey, I won the 3rd place low net (thank you to my unproportionally high handicap) which got me a beauty new hat.  I'm leaving for camp in 2 days so soon you'll see Bateman take over as admin of the blog. I've set it up so he receives the feedback now and he'll do the answering.  I just read this poem here by Tompkins (they spelled it with a "Th" how dare they dis Wayne with a horrible mistake such as that) in the yearbook and it's called "Family Cars" and it is crazy! It's all about like picking fiddleheads and giblet soup and shit. Where does this guy come up with this? What a great guy, that Wayne... I hope I get him next year.  And that's all I got. Take it easy folks.

      Bishy, that sounds awesome... the counselorness not the being almost naked with two teachers...  I just played like the worst round of golf ever in my life. Let me just say that it was three digits, and one was a 1 and one was a 7 and I won't tell you the middle one but it's probably higher than you think. Ouch. Why does God choose to let me shoot like some great rounds all week, when no one is watching (including a Chorkins record breaking 100) and then when the tournament comes around he smites me with this crap. I just hope I play better tommorrow.  Yo, I just got a crazy feedback that I feel the need to answer RIGHT noW!  anonymous terminator lover writes: "FOL I have a question that perhaps you could answer.  How come I have to see all the movies my girlfriend wants to see (Finding nemo, dumb and dumberer, Charlie's Angels 2, Identity, etc) but when I tell her I want to see Terminator 3, she tells me to go with my brother??  Whenever we are watching the tv and the preview comes on, I burst out laughing at Arnold's line: "The t-x has corrupted my system!" and SHE says it kills the mood! what is going on here? do chicks not dig arnold movies as much as guys or something?"  I'll tell you what's going on here. You are unable to pick a good date movie. In fact I would go as far as to say you don't deserve to see movies with chicks, but I'm nice so I won't. I'll just say that you need to get in touch with your feminine side and read this list:   The Top Ten Reasons "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" is not a good date movie   10. There is no romance 9. It's full of violence, special effects, and large austrians 8. you will spend the whole time ogling the chick terminator 7. it severely lacks any presence of Leonardo Dicaprio 6. Honestly, what are your chances of making out during this movie? 5. The number "3" in a title, usually means it isn't a good date movie 4. Ask Will Dick what happened when he took a chick to see DareDevil 3. just what are you getting in the mood for while watching terminator previews anyways...? 2. There are more explosions than love scenes 1. It's just not a chick flick dude...  There you go. My advice? See T3 with your bro, or better yet with the boys (I'm assuming you have a "posse" of boys to see it with). If you want a good date movie try showing off your intellectual side and see a more intelligent movie... like The Shape of Things maybe...

      Wooooooooooord. Yo flounderland. What's poppin? I am so sorry I haven't posted lately guys. I have been super busy and super drunk and super tired all at the same time. I have been working at UCC baseball camp for a week now. The characters that come to such a camp amaze me. Oh and by the way, I was in a towel (just a towel) with Dr. G and JDT$ at my health club the other day. And with the recent scandals at UCC, someone else should finish this sentence for me.     UCC Baseball Camp Counselor - Week One    Ok gees, well I was happy to see that all of the staff was super cool at my camp. The two directors for the time being are supercool hotrod baseball players. Both on scholarships to Canadian and US universities respectively. The one dude that makes it so easy to wake up at 7 something every morinng is this fellow, Elliot or "El-Dawg" as he is known to most. John Spence will vouch for me that he fully could be a ghetto ninja. He is a piiiiiiiiiiiimp. haha el-dawg is a jokester who says some of the most lude, disrespectful things that I have ever heard. I witnised John and an unnamed varsity hockey player "put some greenery in the air" as the el-dawg would say. He also says stuff like "fa real," "woooord," and "holla." I love it.  OK these kids that come to this camp are nuts and freaky. I have this one really cute kid who is all over me and the other counselors, the only problem is that he has 20+ warts on each hand. This is super gross. On wednesday, one of his warts started bleeding and I had to bandage him up while my co-counselors laughed and made barfing gestures and noises. There's also this other kid that leaves ninety percent of the food he eats on his face. The kid's also like 12 or 13 too. He is retarded. Other than that, the others pale in comparison. Except for this fat annoying kid who always taunts me, thus I nailed him in the nunchucks during dodgeball.  Well guys, that's all I got. I've been staying up late at night, then waking up early for work and then napping after work. Buring th candle at both ends, as my dad calls it, is catching up with me. Well fuck that cuz I wanna go out.   PS. Bateman is a grand lifeguard. Except when he doesn't show and I have 10 half naked kids running wild in the basement. Friggin get ur act together.  Peace.

      Cooper and Bateman do not look like Hayden Christensen... speaking of which I saw him on The Famous Jett Jackson recently, yeah he was this bully pushing around Jett's fat unpopular friend and Jett was all like "beeeeyatch". Anyways, I've been told I kinda look like Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys (not exactly complimentary but...) by one Jeffrey "Varsity Badminton" Morash who always calls me Bubbles.  Wow Goose I have to say I'm extremeley disappointed you deleted your whole rant. I was left in suspense. And hey dude, your little brother and/or cousin, who I met at golf camp, is a big "sk8r boi". The only relation between you and him I can see is a love for the Hip and a certain similarity in facial appearance and voice... or something. But I asked him if he liked Lenin, and he was all like "John Lennon?"  I got to play golf with good buddies JRobs and Cowie. I managed to lose all the balls in my bag before the round was through... and played pretty crappy throughout the round, but ah well. JRobs noted I wasn't sporting the Invicta gear, however when I pulled out a book4golf.com golfball he was more than pleased. From the excessive milkshake drinking at the 9th hole to the Froster (thanks JRobs) on the way home, it was good times all round lucky I caught them at the range there.  Golf camp is now over, and the tournament is tommorrow let's hope I put up some good scores... And REAL camp is only 5 days away...  peace

       This feedback thing seems to be getting out of hand. Bateman can be "dumb" and "weird," yet attractive at the same time. Myself, along with the majority of the FOL Cult find J-ROC to be neither stupid nor odd.  Hoinestly , I'm getting confused.    Well, following a seemingly flawless round yesterday, I made my way back to Rosedale for another game of golf. Yesterday I pronounced my game "no longer bad" or something to that effect...How wrong I was, my score nearly 20 strokes higher than my earlier escapade. Horkins, a puppy did not just cry...it died.     As for my personal finances Horkins, they are absolutely none of your business. Besides, that only happened once...Those shoes were so nice...And worth every penny...    God I love the elipsis...    Cooper recently brought up the fact that he "resembled" actor Hayden Christensen, of Star Wars fame. This sentiment is not just restricted to Cooplander, as Bateman is also under the impression that he looks like this guy. I cannot see any resemblence between the two of you, and my good buddy Haydes (as his friends are wont to do), but then again, what do I know? I have been told that I am the spitting image of the actor who played Tadzio (the perfect specimen of human beauty) in a film adaptation of Thomas Mann's  Death in Venice ...So HA!    Anyway, The Head of Jackson's House, Ian Craig "I'm a Steward" Wildgoose Brown is currently in my family compound and would like to post. Hmm...Someone is using a computer and posting on the internet using my name. The last time that happened it certainly went over well (remember, Bateman?).    So here he is...GOOOOOOOSE...    ...    Wow Goose, thanks for your engaging rant. Gooser actually had somthing written, which took him about 20 minutes to compose, but in his typical enigmatic fashion, he deleted it upon completion. In fact, one could draw the comparison to Buddhist monks, who toil for years creating complex works of art...and then burn them, destroying the completed product.

      C-money, I concur, some "serve editing" was in order (severe?) and I have removed the Mckell bashing... Ian, I know you like to bash him but that last one was just downright insulting. It is funny to make fun of McKell but that was just heartless... Anyways, this doesn't harm you in your running for the blog administrator and actually, I'm a kill the suspense right now and say that you got it buddy... Bateman is the new interim administrator, you'll find that you have the admin powers now but don't abuse them... don't go changin other people's posts or setting the background to a classic burberry beige check... or something.  Anyways, Day 2 of Golf Camp was just as fun as Day 1. Highlited of course by a visiting Matthew "Hermes Golf Wear" Cowie and Ian "I know two famous Downie's" WildGoose Brown. I actually found out that some kid I knew was related to Goose and I never even knew... for one and a half whole days! Crazy...  Anyways some feedback for y'all to enjoy....  anonymous nerd writes: "Everyone knows that Terminator 3 is gonna be the the best movie this summer. I have seen the first two Terminators more than any other two movies in the history of seeing two movies.   ----Arnold's Great lines----  "I'll be back" "she'll be back" - That's genius! It speaks to my heart in ways that no woman ever could.  "I know who I am" 6th day, robbed of an Oscar...bastards..  "because I'M going to kill YOU" ahhh, classic quote  As you can see, there are countless Arnold quotes.  ------Shape of things quotes----- uhh "you're so mean for pulling a trick on me that has been done by sooo many movies already"   That's another thing- the plot of The shape of things has happened tons of times. BulletProof by Adam Sandler, The Truman show with Jim Carry, that one where the guy gets paid to take the ugly girl to the prom or whatever.   Anyway, the point is, your poll is lying to me, and its making my summer vacation the worst one ever.....good thing Terminator 3 is coming out soon!!  P.S. Leave cooper as admin, hahaha, it would be soooo F***ed up by the time you got back, haha. He'd let all his tanning buddies get posting privliges, it would be grrreat.  P.P.S Flounder Online Rocks - cept for the recent poll results"  Well... now that the shape of things solidly has about 100 more votes than any other movie on the poll, I would say someone (I'm looking at Spence) has done some m4444d repeat voting... But your terminator fanboy-ness is to be laughed at. I bet if someone went up to you and was all like "I'm looking for this boy" you be all like "aaaaaaaaaah! it's T1000 yo!". Keep reading the site.  anonymous dude writes: "Ian Bateman is weird."  Yes, yes he is... wait a second! That's prejudice foo'! And Mr. T would pity you! You can't judge a man by his classic beige check burberry visor. Now go learn to respect a brotha...  anonymous playahata writes: "what is up with bateman's last post? hoinestly that kid is so dumb."  Okay, enough with the hatemail on Bateman...  Hoinestly !! Learn to spell dumbass.  anonymous fan of bateman writes: "I can't wait to see Bateman in his bathing suit while lifeguarding.  My friend says she's gonna pretend to drown just so he'll give her mouth to mouth."  First off, why is everyone so obsessed about Bateman? Oh right, he's the ultimate paradox, he can be calm and precise or totally awesome. And you stole that off the sandlot, I hope you know you're now obliged to actually do that... obliged i say!  anonymous homey writes: "I asked my mom about poon shivers, and she told me that the internet was evil and I should stop reading your site - what does this mean? "  It means that... your mom is evil and... you should stop reading... her... advice... er... yeah.  lil_lilly rabbit writes: "katie was sooo right on about poon shivers, which my friends and I refer to as she-boners.  it's the time when ya know your feelin it, and if you were a boy you'd be pictching a tent.    speaking of pitching tents, do you pitch tents at golf camp horky-poo?"  er... no. both literally and figuratively.   And that's the end! Keep sendin' it in... or not because I'll be away and you wont get an answer... or something. I'll check in tommorrow or later tonite or maybe in a couple seconds. I go to camp in like... 7 days! peace out homeys

      Horkins, some serve editing of this website is needed.  I promised I made my "last post" a few hours ago, but a post by Bateman caught my eye: Ian, your rants against McKell are unwarrented and cruel. McKell is a nice guy (maybe he would be nice to you if you didn't insult him all the time) with extremly bad luck. You should feel sorry for him, as he could have been making millions in the NHL, but due to an injury of some sort he now has to teach bratty little rich kids. J-ROC, you may never stop ranting against this man but please, for the sake of other blog members lay off stevie.  A few quotes, J-ROC style  "A flute with no holes is not a flute. And, a doughnut with no hole is a Danish."  "So we finish 18 and he's gonna stiff me and I say: 'Hey Lama, hey how about a little something, you know, for the effort?' And he says: 'There'll be no money, but when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness.' So I've got that going for me, which is nice."

      Thank You Katie for that valuable post about the legendary 'poonani' shivers, I didn't know that there were so many ways for a woman to contract them, interesting....... indeed. Well I can officially say that I am tierd of my job after just two days, but on the bright side I only have 48 days left, man Ricci's little brother is annoying, and so are 90% of the other screaming kids. Thus far I have been in the company of such great men as, Alex Bishop, Jeff Taylor, Gregory Lowman, the Space camp councellors and Brett "age is just a number" Moffat. Who says that I have to be cooler than the lifeguards they had last year. Anyway enough of my bitching and complaining about my job, at least I have one. Another guest I had the pleasure of seeing again was Sebastian Borza, our beloved school's former Athletic Steward and First Hockey Captain, he told me some interesting stories about one, Steve McKell....... which I will save for next week, but here is one that I already knew....  [Insert a long rant about how McKell drinks a lot (sorry edited for content...)]   "Ahh yeah! Welcome yall to the dopest party in the nation! kno what im sayin? Yall wanted a licensed bar up in your trailer park, now jroc and the rocpile are proud to present our licensed crib! You kno what im sayin? Open for business, my boys down front throwing the shyt down, come one come all we talking about bustin this shyt open!"

      Matt, I just read your last post... and shut up about sucking at golf... because I actually do suck and when people like you shoot 91 and be all like "I suck" it hurts my feelings and a puppy cries.   and you will ALWAYS be in milan with massive credit card debt.  jokes... but seriously thanks for removing yourself cause i would have picked you over a probably more deserving bateman because of the best buddy thing. Anyways we all love you here. And we all know you have the magic powers, blinding utility (gucci) belts, the ability to make a room of girls at BSS have poon shivers just by a less pretty man mentioning your name to them, and the back to back 97% effect.   PEACE

      Wow... a long time coming Katie, but I think it was worth the wait. Who knew girls watched pr0n... or that Reisman provoked orgasmic reactions with his glare (okay... I actually did know that one... jks). But seriously, while this is cool (I guess the rating of this blog went from PG-13 to like... R) I really would rather not have any of the guys (that means everyone else besides Katie) on the blog talkin about like, the male version (if there's a bulge in a dude's pants...) not cool.  Cooper, I think the General Mills logo is just a stylised "GM", you're probably thinkin about Quaker (or as ricci put it in grade 10 history "the wakers"). They have a quaker, which is like a pilgrim but different. And that executive just proved the existence of lookism in the workplace (oh yeah... ToK presentation).   I started golf camp today and as always it's a fun time and good practice for "the tournament" the jr. championship which is this weekend. Gotta work on that swing you know?  So anyways that's what's up with me. I'm just chillaxinatin', playin a lot of golf, waitin to go up to camp (it'll be sweet). Til next time...

      Horkins,  Although I sent you the application to be blog administrator, I'm afarid I must retract my interest in obtaining that position. Their are several reasons why I have made this sudden, and seemingly random about-face. For one, although I have been an avid reader of Flounder Online ever since it's launch in May 2002, I did not begin posting until recently (about two weeks ago). Secondly, although I have access to the internet at my cottage, the laptop computer that I use is often taken back to the city for work purposes, making my administrative powers effective only when the computer is available (most likely to be on a weekly basis). Although I will continue to post from my locale on the Lake of Bays, it will be on a reduced schedule, (I apologise to all 2 of my fans) and if I was blog administrator, it would be impossible to keep up with the blog on a daily basis. Although I am Horkypoo's best buddy, and I could blind him with the sun's reflection from my Hermes  or  Gucci belt if he didn't choose me, the fact of the matter is that I lack senority and a computer - no way in hell do I deserve this job. Who the fcuk am I kidding.  Regarding who should should get the job, it should, without question, go to Ian J. Bateman. Not only is J-ROC a good buddy of Horkypoo, but he has been posting the longest (sorry Spence, Bishy, Hudson et al). Cooper should, however, deserve serious consideration for the position with his extensive resume, including his skills at being a Goalie Coach  and  for beating up Michael Stephens. Seriously, Stephens gave Bateman a concussion and Cooper beat up Stephens - this deserves serious thought Horkins. As for the rest of the crew, none of them have submitted applications so it is difficult to say who should get the job, but if other people express an interest watch out Bateman and Cooper.  By the way Hork-Dog, I played at Rosedle today in preperation for my match with Ian Wildgoose Brown, his dad and his grandfather tomorrow. As you are well aware, I have been struggling with my game for quite a long time - not anymore. I carded a solid 88 and no longer suck at golf, although "suck" is a relitive term.  This could be my last post for a little while, as my post's are dependent on the arrival of a laptop at my cottage. So don't worry. I am not sick, dead, or stuck in Milan with a massive credit card debt.   See y'all in 3 months.  Cowie

      I must say Katie, for weeks we have all waited in suspense for your poon shivers article.  Expectations were high, so high I did not think that they could be met.  But you know what?  You have exceded all expectations!  Congratulations on a succesful post.  I know that I enjoyed it.  The Coopster never knew how many women received poon shivers from my piercing stare before.  If only I had this information before my encounters with the oppisite sex would not have taken so long to result in success.  Thanks for the snazzy tips Kates.  Much note taking occured.  Your knowledge on poonani was informative and I absorbed this information like a sponge to water.  Remember the poonani is always a welcome subject for the flounder online. Its no wonder that you received more votes than me in the dopest blogger poll.  Funniest commercial I ever saw in my life:  Bored in your current relationship? Stuck in a rut? Trapped by marriage? No worries!  Just go to www.ashleymadison.com and find someone who can help you out of your duldrums. Finally a service dedicated to those who want more than one partner Ashley Madison Agency: When monogamy becomes monotony.  OK I mixed up parts of the commercial because I forget parts of it, but DAMN!  What a jokes site!  You think that they can't come up with a service for everything and then you are amazed by the depths the internet will go.  What's sad is that they are probably making MAD money.  Really, what percentage of men do you think can remain with one partner unless they are COMPLETELY in love.  Too many fine bitties around to have just one.  God I wish I was Islamic or whatever religion allows more than one wife.  The second commercial that blew my mind was one of those MADD ones.  This one is jokes.  First the guy, maybe 16 years old if he's lucky comes to the door to pick up his date.  He is met by the girl's dad and an imaginary conversation insues.  Long story short, the guy says he will probably date rape this man's daughter, because he will be drunk.  He calls the daughter down and the two love birds leave.  OK... What the hell was the point of this add if it is for Mothers Against Drunk Driving?  It has nothing to do with driving except that he has a car.  The add is based on the guy's future actions at the party.  So what's up with that?  Secondly, what does it prove?  Nothing except that these mothers are not very creative.  I will not elaborate as the commercial proves that point.  Thirdly, who the hell does it target to change?  What?  The dad should not let his daughter leave with any guy with a car?  The girl should not go on dates with guys with cars.  Really, this add made zero to little sense.  There was no point to the add and all it does is confuse you.  Its a good add for anti-date rape shit, but not drunk driving.  This commercial gets  Minus 5 Klons out of Five!!!   General Mills has to have the smartest, yet most sexist staff ever, and I like it.  Explanation:  Today General Mills had a shotgun (that's a lot of people playing golf at the same time for the uninformed) at Royal Woodbine (I work there).  There was an inordinate amount of super hot bitches out there!!!  I mean I could hardly do my job!  I was just like staring at the stuff... and the... me like women... Sorry about that.  Good flashback.  Anyways, I talked to one of the men running the tournament from General Mills and the topic of the extremely hot women came up. When I asked him about it he said and i quote "Yeah I know.  I made sure of that when I hired them."  I'm like wow!!  Ummm...  That's sexist right?  I'm not saying that I'm not happy that they were there but... that's wrong right?  Anyways, day still ruled because I got to check out the hot bitties for a couple hours (these chicks were hotter than the chicks at my tanning place, thing)  The general mills logo shouldn't be some pilgrim, it should be a big group of fine ladies, having "fun."  Just joking.  The pilgrims cool.  Cooplander signing--WAIT! I forgot one thing!  I left out something in my application for king of the blog. In grade 9 I beat up Michael Stephens the two time tool of the year.  This happened as I was provoked beyond my limit as those who witnessed it could attest to, even Stephens has admited it.  He bent in my fucking tailbone!  I was allowing Durbin (I miss him) show some guys a special headlock, when Stephens took a running punt at my ass!  He connected with the bottom of my tailbone, and I was forced to take him and ram him from locker to locker, until others pulled me off him.  I still feel the after effects from that attack today. So if you're reading this Stephens... (in a dark voice) We're not even yet, always be careful, I am quite sneaky.  Just joking!  I'm a gentle giant, it takes the most extreme pain to provoke me (that includes kick to my tailbone).  I don't like beating up Oompa Loompas.  Last thing, some guy at work thinks that I look a bit like the actor that played Anakin Skywalker in the second one (before I grew my hair) Anyone see the resemblence? (only those who know me)  Anakin Skywalker signing out (Join the dark side of hair gel)

      Okay, so first things firstlets clear up this ugly rumor that brooker has started (he will pay for it by the way!) I am still posting, I was just away for the past 4 days in Boston with the girlswhere we did happen to have many poon shiver conversation, from which we gathered the following information:  Welcome to Katie, Winks and Sarahs explanation of Poon Shivers.  Please have a pen and paper ready boys because you will DEFINATLEY want to take some notes!!    1. Introduction: Poon shiverswhat are they?    Poon- derived from the stem word poonani, can be defined as the female sexual organ  To many of you out there, poon shivers are a very new concept to you, this could be for 2 reasons a) you dont in fact have a poonani to experience them or b) because Katie (me) basically made it up.  Poon Shivers can be described as the feeling one can achieve from receiving cunnilingus however no physical contact is necessarily required.    2.  Full explanation    How one gets them:  It is a common misperception that to receive poon shivers you need physical contact, this is very untrue, and it is quite easy to receive poon shivers by merely looking at someone or a specific action (e.g. Dave Reismans look. good work duvie!!OHH yes and also can be achieved when girls watch porn, yes we do watch it, AND enjoy itnow theres a fun fact!)  Poon shivers dont necessarily give you the big O, however it can be a good stepping-stone to it (though it is NOT guaranteed!!)  The intensity of a shiver depends on the visual or physical interaction.  Visual-    Reismans look, bishops OH MA GOD, and all of the horkypoo blog members your ability to give poon shivers is rated a high 5 klons (ahhh how I try)   Physical-  dry humping, kissing, massages, holding hands (yes brooker, holding hands gives shivers too (that was a personal note from winks)), a nice hug (we all know that you have the potential for amazing hugs, but some experts are, tapscott, Pete Irwin and AK.   How to control them  We all know girls have the ability to have multiple orgasms but what most do not know is that the same goes for poon shivers- they can last for hours.  Enough said.  Long live the poonani.   How do you know when she is having one? Because poon shivers are normal for girls, there are some very common signals you can pick up to indicate when one is having a poon shiver. SIGNS: -Subtle crossing of the legs -Slow and firm squeezing of the upper thighs -Twisting of the hair -Biting the bottom lip (Our personal experience and expertise on this topic has given us these signs, however, if you know of any others, we would be glad to hear them!)    3.  Who gives poon shivers?   Anyone and everyone is capable of giving a girl some poon shiver lovin you know who you are and if you have doubts, youd be surprised. mua ha ha ha     4.  How this can benefit you   By knowing how to five proper poon shivers, you can be benefited in numerous ways a.	You can give poon shivers to everyone- not only your girlfriend but all girls the toight amount of pleasure they deserve b.	If you are truly talented at giving poon shivers, you will be discussed in the Gr. 11 common room at BSS (A tip to all you boys:  This weekend in Boston, we had the pleasure of meeting the MASTAZ OF POON DISASTAZ.  Although you dont know who they are, we know that you have the potential to live up to their skill.  We are still feeling their effects right now if you catch my drift!! We have faith in you!!    5.  Closing   We hope that you all walk away from this a little more knowledgeable; so that next time you see a girl squeeze her thighs together or bite her bottom lip, remember what we taught you!  Happy poon hunting to all, and to all a good night!   xoxo Katie, Winks and Sarah             -Your poon shiver experts!! -

      Yello, hello, hello!  Haven't posted in a while (2 days or something, probably a new record for me), but I'm finding out that life after school is not perfect.  Just to defend those attacked by "anonymous."  Yeah Bishy and Hudson don't post often anymore, but when they do their posts are pure quality, remember I may post often, but how often are these posts Fishy quality?  Now that the self-hating has come to a close, its time to submit the Cooplander application for king of the blog. (It'll probably be crap)  Skills: 1. Master of all that is lander 2. The ability to turn all that I touch to tan 3. I'm funny. (maybe) 4. I can lift heavy things 5. Uhhhh... that's it I think  Past Experience 1. Former goalie coach for the Etobicoke Dolphins (that's girl's hockey) 2. Goalie coach for Jon Elkins (2002) 3. Currently working at Royal Woodbine Golf Club (I'm open to visitors at all times of the day) 4. I took Computers in Grade 9 with Narkin Arkin (I really don't like him) 5. This one time I saw this guy and I waved (that's an experience)  Others 1. I experienced Tompkin's Class for one year, something Cowie, Spence, etc... cannot say 2. King of hair gel 3. 7th most beautiful man at UCC (determined by Bishy) P.S. I should have been much, much higher 4. I've posted more often than everyone except for Mr. Flounder 5. Most of my posts are after 1 AM so I can work at all hours of the day 6. I can quit my job at any time to take over here 7. I'm down with the hip hop too JJ (Sorry but P Diddy does suck) 8. Uhh... I am Cooplander!  Premier Male model at UCC!!  I must make everything beautiful like me!! (Sorry for the outburst)  Well, that's it.  Not very good mind you, but I did post it on the site unlike some people cough MCow cough.  Now Bateman, work is not as good as you think.  Yeah you're making dough, but... it really SUCKS!!!  I work 5 times this week and 4 of those days I do not get out until 10:30.  I'd rather have a Summer like H-Poo, it sounds damn toight.  I would love to still be able to be dependant on my parents, but unfortunately they have informed me that that will not happen anymore, so I'm working. God damnit!!  Not all bad though, I was able to get drunk at work with my co-workers before getting a ride home with the sober one (I think).  I guess that means I might still be drunk, ah well, I do everything better under the influence of something anyways.  By the way, I hope that that is just a nasty rumor about Brooker's opinion on Katie's blogging privileges.  How could he keep the Poon Shivers from us?  It is simply beyond my realm of knowledge.  Lastly, I don't think I'm drunk.  My last drink was 4 1/2 hours ago, so I think I'm okay. (Maybe)   (By the way if anyone wants to golf at Royal Woodbine, call me and I'll play with you and get you on at half price)  See ya ma homies (Time to get some sleep)

      I am so sorry, Ian, that I'm going to "golf camp" for 4 days... And Matt, I'm sorry I played without you, you should have called I would've played with you. Anyways, interesting Rosedale G.C. story. While waiting to tee off today (played 9, shot 54) I saw one Dave Peppall picking up his clubs for a trip to the cottage in some very fly attire. A few moments later while asking the coolest starter ever, I am of course speaking of the Shelley Mon, when I would get to tee off he asked me where "my friend, dat David Peppall" was. Apparrently Shelley was upset with his dress. "You can't dress like dat round here" he said. But Dave was nowhere to be found. "Disappeared on me".  I go to camp in 10 days!

      Sorry I haven't posted in a while, ever since I've been out of school the days have flown by.... JJ, these anoynmous people who post (J Chong(s) [btw I am not drunk]) need to abide by the same rules as the rest of us, who you have in your dreams is entirely your own personal, albeit bizarre, business ...damn Leprechauns thinking they can call the shots. Anyway, I have to start work tomorrow so it seems that as soon as I am out of school I have to go back and tend to little kids, which sucks. Man some of the people who are working at UCC this summer are sketchy, especially that thug guy with the white dewrag and yankees hat. Anyway it should be ok cause I am raking in the dough (make raking motion with hands) and while some kids are off at golf camp, h-kins, they are not making any money this summer and are dependent on their parents for the rest of the year. Now I am sure everyone knows that Bishop had a nice little jam on Thursday afternoon, but what people don't know is that a certain person was so very inibriated (aka fucked up) that he requires no introduction, Robert Downey Jr. if you're out there, go back to the Betty Ford Centre, they miss you.

      nananana Feedback!  It's that time again...  anonymous writes: "will dick was in my dreams last night."  Okay... I think you should seek professional help. I'm just glad you said "will dick" and didn't add a certain apostrophe s in there...  anonymous writes: "I think that you should get rid of J-ROC Katie and Bishy and Hudson and Farouk (who iss he) because they never post"  First off, Farouk is a very very brown man who likes to hit kids in his Jeep Liberty. Secondly your suggestion would leave me, cooper, spence, and Cowie, and while that's an interesting suggestion I like our current set up. And hey dude, lay off all those people post. But Hudson's been kinda AWOL lately...  anonymous writes: "Chris, Whilest at a party Friday night, Brooker informed me that he asked Katie to "stop posting" on your website. "  I am shocked and appalled! Could this be true... will we never know the joys of "poon shivers". That Brooker... one day he wants priveleges the next he doesn't want priveleges, one day he's telling me he wants me to give his girlfriend priveleges, the next he's off at some party telling you he told her to stop posting. So he can have all the poon shivering info to himself. That's great Brooker... just remember this isn't the CIA your messin with, it' Flounder Online. And when all the trees and mammals are gone, you can't eat your money... and and... uh... nyaah (throws something at brooker)  -Okay MC squared has submitted his application for interim administrator and since he's the only one, he is currently in the lead. Get yours in other peeps! His was really good and I'd like to post it but he asked that it not be posted.  And that's the feedback for today.

      There are a lot of "Shape of Things" fans out there... I personally hated the play of it we saw (sorry Amy Price-Francis... I like Train48 though...) except for the excellent Allan Hawco. But get this, the movie version was a top prize winner at the Sundance Film Festival, which is annually put on by Robert Redford, father to Amy Redford who starred in the Canstage production of TSOT... creepy eh? I never really liked Neil Labute that much.   [excerpt from a theatre class]  Horkins: Well... then... then Neil Labute is just a crappy playwrite! Hoodie: Yeah, sure Chris, and that's why he's only the hottest new playwrite in New York...  ah... the memories. Oh yeah, school is over! I played my first summer round of Golf at Rosedale today and shot my best score this year (or maybe ever, I have to check) at 108... I know it's not that good but it's good for me. I'll be doin the golf camp thang next week, always good times. then I'm off to real camp!   Okay, this is the last music list for a while...  The Top 6 Hottest Hip-Hop Collaborations Ever!  1. The Realest N****s (remix)- Notorious BIG feat 50 Cent and Eminem 2. Still D.R.E.- Dr. Dre feat. Snoop Dogg 3. Thugz Mansion (acoustic version)- 2Pac feat Nas 4. Guilty Conscience- Eminem feat. Dr. Dre 5. Magic Stick- Lil Kim feat 50 Cent 6. Ain't it Funny (remix)- J.Lo feat Ja Rule and others  explanations: 1. If you thought it was a hot track with just Biggie and 50, wait till eminem busts in after 3 minutes with a whole 'nother 2 verses! 2. A classic track. Dre and Snoop back together again. Great rhymes, you know the words its so good. 3. Off of the better dayz double album after his passing, this song is not only one of the ultimate chillin' rap tunes, but also has a deep and profound message which is made more powerful since his death. And Nas is there too... 4. The hottest new rapper collaborating with his seasoned veteran mentor in one of the best storytelling tunes ever created. Very contraversial. And it gave Eminem a lot of cred. 5. This track is hot. Great beat. It won the "big beat battle" on the former Kiss 92 (RIP) on May 2-4 weekend beating out favourite "in da club" also by 50. Great rhymes, great beat... and would you listen to those lyrics? 6. Okay okay, I know what you're sayin'... Ja Rule is quite the "wanksta" but I want to represent all genres of Hip Hop on this list and Hip "pop" is one of em. This is however a great track, even Ja's Murder Inc no name buddy (Caddy?) has some good rhymes. Overall it's a great track.  My final order of business is this. As you know I'll be away for most of the month of July starting on June 25th. And I was thinking that I shouldn't just leave the blog without an administrator. So I got to thinking... I should grant one lucky member of the blog administrator powers during my abscence. I could give it to bish because he's so toight and threw a heckuva jam. I could give it to Hudson because he's such a fly guy with his Phoenix gear. I could give it to JROC because he really was the first guy, other than me or that little post by Will Dick, to join the blog. I could give it to Cooplander... because... he'd tan the blog (it is kinda pale huh...). I could give it to Spence because he kinda won the dopeness poll. I could give it to Katie because the blog would have collective poon (Ashley) shivers. I could give it to C-dog because I spend so much time at his house. I could give it to Farouk cause he's brown... or I could not give it to him... for the same reason. Or I could give it to the blogger who writes the craziest application to me using the feedback system... lying is encouraged.  i'm out

      That Roy...  The Italian Job was quite the flick if I do say so myself. An excellent movie, never boring the whole way through. A Heist movie rivaled only by the upcoming FoolProof starring Wai Luon Choy. And Charlize Theron is so hot right now... But the highlight of seeing this movie I must say is the fact that who should waltz in, in full Indiana Jones gear (beige suit, pink shirt, straw hat), but Dr. John D. Thomas. That's right, the JDT was at the same movie as us.   I'm thinking of changing the poll soon. In fact right now. Here are the final results:  The Dopest Bloggers:  1. J.Sp 1. Bishy (tie) (5) 3. Katie (4) 4. Flounder (3) 5. Cooplander (2) 6. J-ROC (1) 7. Hudson (0)  other options: None of them are dope... (10) Are any of them ninjas? (5)  Spence and Bish, all I can say is... you cheated and I am so doper than you.

      Bishop, you seems to have misenterpreted the intent of my post earlier today. I never once criticized Roy for his actions yesterday. I only commented that he "abused" various substances. I never once said that Roy made the "incorrect" or "wrong" decision, nor would it be in my position to do so. In fact, I commended him for his ability to seemingly be uneffected by said substance abuse, even going so far as to say "Way to go Roy" in my post. If anything, it was you who expressed disapproval at Roy's actions, stating that he "hacked [butts] like never before," and that this smoking "dissapointed" you.  I saw the new film "The Italian Job" earlier today, and although it was not up to par with the original (what is) it was still a very good film. The Mini Copper chase, as predicted by Luca was of very high quality, but it did not make me want to buy one of those cars as he also assured would happen.  Cooplander: Much kudos for being to tend the goal while under the affluence of incolhol. Now I know why Patrick Roy has done so well over the years...(just jokes Patty).   On a final note, I would also like to encourage those who have posting privilages to continue to post on this website. Posting is a sacred right, and we have had too many of the one post wonder variaty, DJ Lucky Lukes and DC-Unit to name a few. Do not go the way of Luca and Dave, and post!

      Man yesterday was jokes!  Bish you threw a toight little jam.  Cooplander consumed his fair share of "stuff" and yet still was able to remain the designated driver (says a lot about the status of everyone else).  I'd have to say the highlight of the day was my miscalculation of (Drunko)'s inebriation level when I let him drive a couple blocks.  Let's just say it was not a smart decision (he almost crashed more times than I can count)  (Roy) man, someday you will be able to handle your substances better. Be patient young jedi.  The drive over to (Buddha)'s house was quite funny, with many unique characters in my car.  The usual suspects were (Drunko), (literary genius), Walshy and uhh... someone I forget.  Anyways I had advice raining down on me from all corners of the '99 Ford Windstar (I hate that car/minivan)  (Drunko) beside me saying to take him home because he wanted to change into a clean shirt (weird when going to (Buddha)'s) and the trio of guys in the back yelling when to turn where to go and to ignore the ranting and raving of (Drunko).  Eventually we got there and I hope they all took the HIGH road back home.  If I didn't have to be back for hockey I defenitley would have joined them in their escapades.  I can't think of any parents I would rather have then (Buddha)'s.  They are the King and Queen of parents.  Speaking of hockey... I learned that I play better in net when I am half-drunk.  In the 60 minute scrimmage, the collection of 30 year old plus seniors failed to score on Cooplander.  Huzzah!!  I stop all the shots!  The Coopster!!  I am invincible (on the ice) The Coopster!! Boing, snootchy bootchies!!  Last few points, things I need to buy for an enjoyable Friday Night  1. Beer Bong (I did enjoy bonging my beer back) 2. Beer, Bacardi, Smirnoff, etc... 3. Ladies (I don't buy these)  So far it looks like my Friday night is going to be killer.  Notice I didn't mention my car.  This is because drinking and driving is not cool...  unless you're drunk, then everything's kool.  Have a good Friday night and drive safe  stay tuned for MAGNUM   TOODLES!!!!  P.S.  I did my own censoring, didn't want to fall under the jurisdiction of good old Jumbo Jet  PAYCE!!!!!!!!!!!

      Well, thespians and the like. Yesterday was our end of year theatre jam. Non-theatre students Willy and Walshy showed up. They were welcomed with open arms. [Roy] and [Frank] hacked like never before. This dissapointed me. The fact that [Roy] got a little sauced-up was no big deal though Cowie. Everyone needs to learn where their limits lay sometimes. [Roy] had a great time, needless to say. He didn't harm you, Matt. If you don't like seeing him like that, that's completely understandable but young people like us need to experiment and see what's doin. Just as long as he didn't go too far (which is really hard to do with some beer and a little smokaging). We all had a great time and Cowie, you really need to let loose buddy. Let the good times roll.  So after our little diggity shin, a lovely man, Peter Irwin, helped me clean up. Man I though theatre guys were classy. You dudes messed up my house h-core. Who dropped the bottles? No worries though. It only took a little bit of cleaning. After this, we went to a couple of fine establishments, ingested some food and drinkstuffs. I then walked home. Begging cabbies to drive me home for free didn't work. After attempting this many times, they all shut me down and then I walked home very late at night, through a scary park in the rain. Adventurous night to say the least.  Rumours have been floating around about spence's night. I missed him at these aforementioned establishments. I heard that it was a good HIGHer level theatre exam for him indeed. Horkypoo rocks on. Where is katie? I'm ansty to hear about the poon shivers. Nice seeing everyone yesterday. And, as Bateman's mom often gasps to me in ecstasy, "Let's do it again."  --bishy

      First off, many thanks are due to Bishy for hoasting a truly glorious jam yesterday. Bish you are the man, but [Roy], following the episode yesterday, I lost a very marginal amount of respect for you. Now [Roy], I love you and that's why I am only slightly pissed, but you made substancial abuse of a number of substances yesterday. As a certain professor would say...  "You're level of [awesomeness] [was] shocking."  Still, some credit should be given to [Roy], because even though he was servely under the influence, he was still walking (and [expelling the excess of his afternoon]) down Yonge Street. Honestly, I was shocked/awazed that you managed to stand up following that epsiode. Way to go [Roy]!   I must also give a massive shout out to my good buddy and fellow theatre pimp William David Dick, who, beleive it or not, said that he "likes" what I post here. Thanks Will! At least I have 1 fan. Although my post's may not be up to the calibour of Horkins, Bishy et al, I can honestly say, without exadduration or hyperboyle that I am better than Farouk. Sorry F-Dog. You are a good guy and dress well, but that last post was awful.

      I FIXED IT!  haha.... I truly am the greatest guy.  Before I begin with the final exam update, I'm gonna say a few words about yesterday: Bish, it was a good time at your place thanks buddy, but afterwards let's just say it wasn't my proudest moments so let's not talk about it. Booth, I can't believe I was in that car with you... those poor Quizno's janitors.  But enough of that...   UCC Exam Marathon Update 2003: Final Edition    Theatre : We did some sleuthing before the exam and found out that it was a play about a play in a play. It was Sam Beckett's Catastrophe and basically we had to put on paper, how we would put on this play. This exam went pretty well, I can't really say I had difficulties in writing how I do it. I was a little concerned when Cow-Dog wrote 4 books and I only 1 and a half. But really, the thing with this exam was that it wasn't really a review of the year. I could have probably more or less written the same exam before the year had started. And because of that I can't really say I am very confident of the result, but it was still pretty good.  Chillness Factor : 3.75 klons out of 5

You might also be familiar with the front bumper of my car if you were takin a stroll near the victoria terrace driving centre on March 5...  I decided to blog it up to balance out Flounder's cracker factor. Just like Katie's female touch, I'll be adding some colour to this site.   I gotta bounce but Horkins, mad props for the sick site.

      I've decided that from now on the feedback answering will occur more or less every monday at the beginning of the week, and I don't think I'll be putting up any psycho emails like the last one... whoa man that was just weird.  Today, I was cruisin around town with Fa-Rule (who will soon be posting here) and the WAC boys to the meeting we had at the B to the H-S (branksome for those who don't speak thug) pumpin some ill tunes. Phat beatz if you will. And speaking of phat beats I just can't get over this song "Where is the Love" by Black Eye Peas featuring Justin Timberlake. Get it. It's quality.

      Horkins, what's up with this crazy feedback? Although it's great to have Rice and Jeffy on our side, I not too sure about this "Daisy" person. I don't know about you, but to me, it looks suspiciously like somthing Ian Harris would write. As great a guy as Harris is, he is a little nuts with his random bursts into Shawn Desman songs. Who will ever forget that history class during the pinnicle of UCC Idol mania where we were treated to the musical stylings of Alex "healthy scratch" Frachette, Wai "Zoolander" Choy, James "He fell victim to the falcoms" Ricci, and of course, Harris. Cooper you proably missed this one, as it was likely that you were either sleeping and or skipping.   Bish thanks for you're warm welcome to the site. I'm happy that I turn you on (I saw the way you were looking at me from the reflection in my shoes). As for my blogging skills, cut me some slack Bish. I'm new to the site and am still learning the ropes. Give it some time and they will improve.

      An admirer. How Wonderful! Finally my intellectual prowess has become as attractive as my godlike body. jokes  It was only a matter of time before the ladies (I hope that my admirer is a she, 'cause I don't want a gay admirer... not that there's anything wrong with that) could find me on the website.  Now that my short little ego trip is finished, I'd like to commend H to the orkypoo for his amazing job with the flounder merchandise.  That thong, so hot right now. I wonder what the front office lady will think if you receive the 5 Klons Thongs. Oh La La!  I am so getting the mug.  Welcome back Bishy!  The Judge is back!  Your toightness was sorely missed by the blog in your short absence.  We still love you with all our body including our pee-pee  (he heh he... pee pee, i said a nasty, he he he...) You will have to give us a time for the presentation of the klondike to Horkins for his 6 line mastery.  He surely deserves it after a 5 klons performance.  I was thinking about posting some photos of myself on the web, but... I decided against this, for the legacy of Cooplander must be shrouded in a cloak of mystery and weirdness.  BLUE STEEL!!  FEEL THE BEAUTY!!!  Sorry about that. Got carried away. Late photo shoot. heheh hheh  Lastly, don't worry about Cooplander the male model.  If you want more stories they will come.  The adventures of Cooplander and his alter ego Henry Kinkaed will continue if the demand is great enough.  If it is stories you want then send feedback to Flounder and I will do the rest.  Last thing (I swear it is this time) its fun to yell at people from a car when you are drunk. Such intellectual phrases as "WASH MY SHORTS!" or "WHICH WAY TO NEW JERSEY?" or "MAKE MY BED!" I'm even a little drunk right now so... "EVERYONE WASH MY SHORTS!" he he he....  See y'all at the test of our theatre skills. And where are all my fans?  I only have 2 votes in the dopest blogger contest and I know who voted (hint: I have two computers in my house) FANS OF COOPLANDER, UNITE! SHOW YOURSELVES!!!!!!!  All I have to say is... TOODLES!

      Ah muchachos. It feels good to be back. As h-kins suspected, I was taking a little exam break from posting on this beloved website. Horkins is a blogging god now. We should paint him gold, oil him up, fan him with palm leaves, and feed him peeled grapes. He added a poll, merchandise and feedback. I love it with all of my body (including my pee-pee (that will never get old)). This site is now super-intense. Like camping (get it? IN TENTS) haha I stole that from Spence.  The additions of Cownog and Stonedawg skew my boner a little. I love it. Cowie turns me on sooooo much. His gorgeous features, his golden hair all mix together with a little 'south beach-chic' clothing makes me have male poon shivers. (Do these exist katie?) Cowie, you need to work on your blogging prowess. Your posts are choppy and full of things that some people on the blog do not understand. Rock on though, you are the fashion man, man. My loins are on fire.  I am going to buy some thongs (aka ass floss) for my entire family. My dad loves them so much they make his jimmy all hot and crazy. YUCK!  Horkins (aka blogging budha): We are not worthy! We are not worthy!   --bish

Be sure to check out the Radiohead TV link. You can watch the video for There There, which is actually a pretty trippy video... and check out the Coldplay link too. Good stuff. If you don't have quicktime, like, download it (it's an apple software but it works for PC too...)

      J-ROC, It is unbeleiveable that we forgot about Switzer. How could we? God that was stupid of us. What were we on? Oh yeah, I remember. Coffee. Maybe a republishing of the "Tool of the Year" list is in order. I enjoyed your classification of said individual; ("He is like the Craftsman Bolt-Out of the tool world") however, I beleive Switzer best fits the Fisher-Price plastic saw, or Atlanta Braves Novelty Hammer classification in terms of his tooliness. In addition Baty-man, you discuss the virtues of the show fastlane and others. Even J.Sp discusses the prowess of Train 48. I for the most part disagree with J-ROC's taste in television (Miami Vice, Hunter, Rockford Files, A-Team, et al), but I have watched Train 48 and found it to be somewhat humorous, these posts (for some reason) bring to mind Canadian television shows I once watched, namely Traders and Power Play. Ahh Traders. Who could forget the omonous opening sequence, with the sun rising and setting over the financial district of Toronto to the tune of nun's singing, and random bursts of techno music. From it's wobbly camera angles to the compelling acting, (namely Patrick McKenna of Red Green show fame as Marty, the crazy floor trader) Traders was a great show.  And of course, one cannot forget Power Play. The intreguing drama of the Hamelton Steelheads Hockey Club, who were always strapped for cash, but still managed to defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs to win the Stanley Cup. It's theme song, a hard rock version of "The Good Old Hockey Game" may have even satisfied J-ROC's picky musical tastes. Honestly, this show was great. With Rod Black doing hockey commontary, Parker the hockey agent getting into all sorts of carzy mishaps, and Don Cherry coaching the Philidelphia Flyers, who couldn't love this show? By the way, open the College Times and read Pudelsky's leaving class resume. 250 words of things like "ska-rilla fa-rilla" and "flip the script." Spence would (and proably will when he sees it) shead a tear at this blatent butchering of the English language.

      Okay, the blog has just experienced some general weirdness as a result of me trying to implement a "better feedback system" (suggested through the current feedback system) which caused the blog to get all messed up (look it's a frickin template, I suck at html) and as a result I'll be sticking with the feedback system I have now. It'll apear on the blog when I answer the feedback I like I did earlier today.  Ian, if Hugh and Chloe ever had kids, they would have a hammer... because they are tools. Get it? A Hammer! I love me.  I've decided that the poll will be a more or less weekly thing. I'll basically change it whenever I want to... and vote for ME ME!!!!

      Ah...nothing's better after a long night of...thinking...than waking up to some solid horkypoo postage.  Except enough with the ducks and devils, all right!  I was at a bar last nite and when the devils won, absolutely no one cared.  Maybe everyone was just too...deep in thought...i know i was.  Anyways, word up to horkypoo for his appreciation of Train 48.  And what's up with that na na na na na na Train theme song?  It's catchy.  I completely agree with you about Liz.  She is so hot and I can't believe she is resorting to artificial insemination a.k.a. turkey baster (Thanks Shannon, you bitch.)  I got a turkey baster in my pants, if you know what I mean.  (Hint:  It's my junk.)  And the dude who scored in the GO train bathroom was "Lucas".  He is a really cocky rich womanizer sorta guy.  Nicole (Amy Price-Francis) really hates him and accuses him regularly of being "full of crap".  (Terrible language.)  One more thing though, Johnny McLaughlin, hoser extrordinaire, is so far removed from a caricature I don't know what you're smoking, eh bud?    I'm a little offended/flattered/disturbed by an aspect of Cowie's most recent post:  Cowie: Hey Brooker, I just saw an ugly version of you.  Brooker: Who? John Spence?   I quickly disagreed. Spence is not only a beautiful man, but also one of FOL's best writers.  I am offended by Brooker's adament maintenence that I am an "ugly version of him".  It's not the "ugly" that bothered me (I am secure in my gorgeouseness)  but rather the "version of [Brooker]"  To be compared to Brooker Belcourt in any manner is obscene.  Brooker is the goofiest kid on earth who didn't know what cunnilingus was until he looked it up on  urlLink Dictionary.Com .  What a maroon.  Furthermore, I am flattered by Cowie's defense on my behalf, however slightly disturbed as it sound like he may have a small to medium sized boy-crush on me.    Anyways I need some brekkie.   Vote for "J.Sp." as dopest blogger of them all.

      Well another season is over and tis the time we regretfully say goodbye to Sunnyvale Trailer Park for another year, but luckily 'studying' for exams has brought another great TV show back to my attention.  Fastlane ! Possibly one of the greatest shows ever made/created (next to trailer park boys and clone high). It is a combination of VIP, Miami Viiiiiiiice, Baywatch, the Rockford Files, and Hunter. And it has to meet their quota of some kind of controversial scene every episode, my favourite was the lesbian kiss between Jamie Pressely and Tiffany Amber Theissen, as I am sure many of you will agree. Not only that but the boring plot is jam packed with car chases, shootouts, and scanditly clad women. Yes it is truly the marvel of modern day television.  Softserve, thank you for reminding me of Hugh 'needle dick' Switzer. How could we forget this grand tool! He is like the Craftsmen Bolt-Out of the tool world. Hugh and Chloe, for those of you who were fortunate to view that 'Satire' site, you are oh too well aware of Chloe's antics, and the ladies at BSS are no doubt aware. Now Hugh during that little play called KR2 kept bashing Chloe calling her this that and the next thing. But then what does he do? He decides that he'll supress his homo-sexual urges by going out with her (although i think that that is encouraging them, sorry Will). So now Chloe was going to the Batt with Hugh and Hugh to the formal with Chloe. But when I proposed the question to Hugh if had engaged in ye olde Josh Farr anal dry humpty dump with her yet, he told me to Fuck off. Sorry Hugh but the public has a right to know. By the way, your children will have hooves. Have fun kids, ya fucking tools.

      OK J-ROC let's get one thing straight...I am not a Devils fan by any streach of imagination...Just an accurate hockey game predictor. The trap lulls me to sleep, and Ken Danyko is honestly the slowest skater I have ever seen in professional hockey. Granted, their are some people on the team who I like (Neidermayer, Broadeur) and I was happy that Pat Burns won a Cup (Why didn't you do it for the T-Dot in 1993) but I hate most of them (Stevens, Lamerello, et al). Honestly, Lou is such a tool, and should have been on J-ROC's list. Oh, and by the way J-ROC, we forgot a guy on the list, and I can beleive that we did so...  Hugh Switzer  Honestly, the whole Chloe situation deserved top three. First he bashes her, then he goes out with her??? What a tool!  Anyway, back to hockey. Although you're proably right about the attendence figure - no one goes to those games - I not so sure about the pre-third pep talk. Maybe Babcock threw a giant cardbord cutout of himself in a fire bin, or Hans told him he "just got out of the shower," or maybe the team was so dissapointed following their trip to Compton where, to their chagrin, their is no street-hockey gang that they lost (no knucklepuck to elude Broadeur). On a more serious note, after walking accross the Quad yerterday morning on my way to my history exam, I noticed, emerging from Seaton's House, Brooker Belcourt. I walked over, hoping that UCC two most beautiful men could have a chat, but it turned out this wasn't Brooker, but instead a kid that just looked like him. Sure, this guy had the physique and the wavy locks...but he was ugly. Upon entering the school I was fortunate enough to run into the real Brooker. Here is an exermpt from the conversation...  Cowie: Hey Brooker, I just saw an ugly version of you. Brooker: Who? John Spence?  I quickly disagreed. Spence is not only a beautiful man, but also one of FOL's best writers. I informed Brooker that his ugly version was not Spence, but instead a border. Other FOL members please comment on this ugly version of Brooker (if you have seen him).

      I was wondering why the Ducks lost... You f-ckin' jinxed 'em SoftServe! You and Don Cherry! Honestly how could anyone be a Devils fan... they're the Devils! They're just so... evil. That Scott Stevens, him and Gary Bettman are pals. I bet they had to pay people to wear Devils Jerseys and sit in the stands last night with their Thunderstixxx. That Grant Marshall just looks retarded... I bet he is too. Anyways it's really too bad the Ducks lost, it's good that they gave Giguere the Conn Smythe but that last game made me doubt that he really deserved it. I can't believe they booed him when he got it. He just took it right off to the dressing room. Way to go Giggy!  I guess Bombab-cock's pep talk in the second intermission didn't work. Ah...  "Steve Thomas, Scarborough Ontario" "Adam Oates, Markham Ontario" "Jean Sebastien Giguere, Montreal Quebec" "Alexei Cheesetov, Cheeseburg, somewhere in eastern Europe" "Rob Neidermayer, Cranbrook British Columbia" "Wayne Goldberg, Minneapolis Minnesota" "Charlie Conway, St. Paul Minnesota" "hey, get out of the fucking dressing room, you punk kids!"  Anyways. Spence, you are very right. Train 48 (or as I call it "the nananananaTrain show") is a great show. First of all they, write, act, and film it all the day they show the episode. So it's full of timely current events, and it reeks of improv. Sure the acting might not be so great, but hey when I watch this show I say "hey, I could be on this show". Some of the characters are horrible caricatures of society (the redneck dude, "Johnny") and some are just normal people, but it all comes together. The show is SO Toronto made programming it ain't funny which is good for Global, usually they rely on Traders and Ready or Not reruns. And Liz is so hot right now. I can't believe she has to resort to artificial insemination... she's fine! And that dude, can't remember his name, he had sex in bathroom of the GO train.... and he conspicuously looks like Andrew "B.Fleck" Kennedy, Cowie you know who I'm talkin about. And it's on EVERY (week)DAY. Great Show 5 klons.  "So, you seen her play, then you ate some vegetables... boom." -Johnny, Train 48

      Shame on you Rook. Didnt you see that splendid movie D2. There were down like 9-0 to Iceland, but then the old German hockey old timer came in the second intermission and gave them new jerseys, and then they kicked ass, especially the other black kid who wasnt the goalie who did that weird shot, and he dressed up like the goalie and went out and scored the tying goal, and then in the shoot out they like had the Iceland guy go up against the girl goalie, not the black one or the other black one, but the girl one, and Emilio was like this guy is fancy hell go glove! and then they won. Aaah Good Times.  Man you wanted a kiss but instead you got butkissed! Ah, kiss, butkiss, I just totally rhymed! I rhymed! Rhyme, rhyme! Ahh. I did it again! Whats so great about accidentally rhyming? There are no accidents in rhyming dog. You see rhyming is a god like force that chooses people for stardom. It happened to Bubba Sparks and now, it is happening to me. You kinda rhymed kiss with kiss Ghandi. Please! Call me G-Spot!   Check it out. G-spot rocks the G-spot, G-spot rocks the G-spot. Wow you just totally rhymed! Say hello to the next Bubba Sparks!  Clone High, If God had a clone and his clone watched TV, Im sure he'd watch that show.  Ducks In Nine all I gotta say.

      Spence, you beat me by 3% in December and will proably do so again, but I'll try my best. Additionally, I will concede that Sex and the City is a well-written and well-acted show based on the number of awards it has won; however, the only episode I saw involved an 8 month old pregnant woman going out to buy high-heeled shoes, which would undoutably result in intense pain. A little unrealistic, no?  I'm sorry Duck nation, but there's no way they are winning tonight. For one, Boradeur is a dynamite money goalie and secondly, the ducks are terrible on the road. Sorry boys, I hope I'm wrong but I'm sticking to my original prediction - Devils in 7.

      eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee - I am so happy - only one exam left and it's theatre.  Hopefully I can improve on my 94% December exam.  (Suck it Cowie, Horkins, Bishop, Bateman, Cooper, et al.)    Okay I gotta get something out of the way:  Sex in the City.  Our beloved cooplander has been taking a lot of heat lately due to his affection for the program.  I admit; I own the first three seasons on DVD (my mom and sis bought em) and I've probably watched a total of 3 or 4 episodes.  By any objective standard of measurement, Sex in the City is a cleverly written, well-acted and ultimately above-average television series.  Admittedly, it may be a tad pretentious for some, and others may feel their masculinity threatened by watching the show, however, this auhor has enough security in his sexuality to admit to watching and enjoying Sex in the City.  For one, these chicks are big sluts who basically talk about sex nonstop. - that's pretty cool.  Second, there is a lot of nudity, especially coutesy of that sexpot Samantha.  Third, there is this one episode where Carrie dates this stoner.  They sit around and get high and eat fried chicken and in the end the guy turns out to be a scrub so Carrie takes his weed and her and all her slutty friends get stoned and eat fried chicken together.  Yeah, so I really enjoyed that one.  So guys, lay off Cooplander, have an open mind, and have Sex.  You won't regret it.  Oh and also I got to give huge whattups to new Flounder members Katie Stoneman and Matthew "Diva" Cowie.  I sense the sexiness factor just went up a few notches around here.  Anyways, I'm really anxious to find out more about these poon shivers and I think the world is also ready for more information on Brooker's hideous body rash.  I'm just kidding; like any mammal, Brooker can be an annoying fairy OR magically delicious.  Be careful, Katie.   urlLink Careful and precise.   One more important thing that should be brought to the attention of all FOL members.  TRAIN 48.  It's this toight new show (Global (ch.3) weekdays at 7pm) about 10 commuters and their lives.  It is filmed that morning, edited then shown in the evening.  All the dialogue is improv and often sort of mundane, but captivating nonetheless.  It features Amy Price-Francis (Shape of Things) and a bunch of other no-names.  Check it out though - "Liz" - twice divorcd career-woman = so sexy.  Anyways, it's on in like eight minutes so I should wrap this up with a patented Cooplander quote:  "All I want is a girl to dry-hump, leave, then brag to my friends about." -Gandhi

      I hate posting this many times in one day but i forgot this and  I wanted to talk about it seeing as C-money is now on the blog. The "Exam Beard" can be seen on such individuals as Matthew M. Cowie and David R. Steinbach and most probably Adam H. Louis. Is shaving during exams really bad luck? Has anyone noticed me sporting the "Exam Dirty Sanchez" with matching "Exam Peach Fuzz" cause frankly it's kinda looking kinda weird right now (I'm Irish, we don't grow facial hair well... ask Conan O'Brien), I'm keepin it cause I made the "exam beard pact" (with myself) but I tell you one thing I'm bringin my shaver to the Theatre exam...

      Cowie, I never thought you would actually ACCEPT my umpteenth offer to join the blog... seeing as you reminded me many times how you didn't want to post. Maybe you could comment on the Tony Awards (both our version and the real ones). If only the other random guys who have been invited would join (thats you booth, AK, George). Welcome aboard, best buddy!  Cooper for the last time, Sex and the City is not a good show, the dudes (if there were any) who voted it for the emmies were all either gay, or had a nagging wife/girlfriend who wanted them to vote for it. If you want something late at night on Showcase perhaps try Oz or Trailer Park Boys or even The Red Shoe Diaries, you would take less heat for that.  And dude don't worry, the more the merrier I say! Except when we get the DC-Units of the world... ah well. As for Bish and Huddy. Hudson told me today that he had somehow lost the ability to post, so I just reinvited him and hopefully he'll be back up soon. Bish, if you're just takin an exam break, then come back soon, if the same thing happened to you, you have my ICQ gimme a holla. And you owe me a klon!  Without further adue....   UCC Exam Marathon Update- Penultimate Edition    English - This year we were treated to the privelege of having an oral (and rectal) english exam. Basically you get a poem or a passage, 20 mins to prepare notes, and then 15 minutes between you, a tape recorder, and your english teacher (WT!) So anyways I was lucky enough to draw a poem I had studied (The Tuft of Flowers) and I was able to get down some notes, and tried to organise it as best I could on the actual page they gave to us. Unfortunately, this commentary is no easy task. I'm not quite the impromptu speaker as Antony Dobrzenzky, so my impromptu commentary was riddled with "uh..." pauses, words I'm pretty sure don't exist (bewilderment?) and drawing blanks. I finished, in my opinion, WAY too early ("well we still have a lot of time left...") and WT basically took over and brought all sorts of crap I had never even thought of. The man is a genius and all I could do was be like "yeah" and just be like "it's definitely a metaphor... uh..." In the end he said it was short but concise, and overall, i think I remember he said it was "good" or maybe he said "very good" but I sure didn't feel good about it. A very different and tough exam.  Chillness Factor : 2 klons out of 5  Coming up on Exam Update: Theatre, can you really study? Is that an excuse not to study? Don't you think Mr. Dick Hood's name is synonymous with foreskins? Will I crash and burn like at Xmas? Did you know that Harvey Fierstein was actually a dude before you saw his picture in the paper today?  One word about the... er... contest. When you get a big package at camp they make you open it in front of the office lady to make sure there ain't no candy in it... so keep that and the fact that this month is one big job interview for me in mind... I want kool stuff not embarassing stuff. And klondikes will melt...  1 left and I'm free boys!

      Wow!  The Flounder is expanding by the day!  Careful Chris we still want to have some sort of fan base or whatever it is we call people who read our blog.  But lt seems that they all find the fact that I watch Sex in the City a little "weird."  As a defense (I can't believe I'm doing this) the series has won a large amount of emmies and I don't think the panel that decides this award is all women, it can be enjoyable.  Once again I can't believe I'm defending THIS!  'Cause if I'm watching this show its because my day probably sucked, because if I'm at home on a Friday night at 12:00 AM then my day probably sucked.  I don't think anyone should judge someone by what they watch on television.  Even if someone watches "Queer As Folk" (I don't, I don't intend too, and if anyone says anything about me mentioning that show I'm just gonna...)  I find it weird that I have to keep defending myself every day, maybe I should just quit tryin.'  But anyways that's just my opinion.  Hmm two debates in one week, guess which one contained more knowledge (hint, hint, Spence's).    Anyways since Horkins cannot comment on the History exam I will fill in for him.   History:   What can I say?  Well paper one was amazingly superfly easy in everyone's opinion, not one person was concerned about that one.  The next two papers were a little more concerning, the first essay I picked was about econmic reasons and military victory in Mexico, viva zapata! (inside joke for dr. t students).  Not too difficult if you studied, but... yeah.  On paper 3 I  picked the one about Villa and Zapata, anyways this was the hardest exam so far in my opinion.  I took a giant bite out of my ass (ignore the homoerotic stuff there)  Anyways, history bitched me for the last time this year, 3 months till it can strike again.  Chillness Rating:  1 klons out of 5  Heading to the golf course now.  By the way where the hell are Hudson and Bishy?  We miss you guys.  Cooplander signing out

      Well Horkins, after several offers to join the blog, I have finally accepted. Yes, it's offical...Cowie is now on the blog. I want to thank Horkins for being relentless to get me on here, and it's an honour to be surrounded my such great people as Bateman, Hudson, Spence, Bish, Cooper and Katie; however, a recent post by Cooper got my attention where he described Sex and the City as a "funny" show. Cooper, I (along with most men) disagree with you on this one, because Sex and the City is a show about 4 single women who live in New York City -  a difficult situation for a teenage boy in Toronto to relate to - and the comedy is derived from the various "comedic" situations these women get into. The fact that you could relate to women who spend the majority of their day drinking cosmopolitans, and talking about or having sex is downright scary.  But that's just my opinion Cooper. I assure you that the falcons are not ganging up on the dove.

      Cooper, we love your weirdness (or at least I do...) RIP to the daily quotes, we knew thee well... You certainly provided the needed craziness to the blog. And just because you like Sex and the City does not necessarily make you a flaming queer... not  necessarily .... jokes...  JROC: I realise it seems rather hypocritical to give best play to Working, and all the acting awards to KR2... but the thing is KR2 was in itself a really boring play, what made it good was the actors. All in all, we came to an agreement that Working was indeed the best play of the year, however the acting honours just all seemed to go to KR2 people. And it seems you don't want to hand out your "Hottest Chick Award" and finish the show so we'll leave it open...  UPDATE: My fellow judge, C-money has conceded the Best Team award to Working... so yeah we have that one.  Brooker's Girlfriend: Hey, I want to know about what it's like to date Brooker... (so hot right now) and I'm sure anything you want to post will be appreciated. Although that is sure to be... uh....  interesting ...  But how cheap was that hit on Kariya by Stevens the other night... should have been illegal... anyways the Ducks are winning the CUP tonight! IT'S ON!!!!! And go Spurs Go! New Jersey is gonna be flooded with tears by the end of this month!

      It is only fitting that the blog's number 1 fan becomes a poster, so I think I speak for everyone on the blog when I say welcome to the Flounder Online Katie.    Just gotta clarify a few points.  Someone's taste in television should not be something to be ashamed of.  I simply find Sex in the City to be a funny show  Oh, if I was worried about what people thought about me then many of my earlier, actually all of my posts would be different. 'Cause you know what when it comes to what people think about me, I just don't give a fuck!  Really I don't care. jks  Wow. The blog has changed so much since I came on everyone seems to have created their own personal style now. Flounder: Lists, Awards and jokes by the boat load. Hudson: Guy who likes to laugh at other people's posts. Bishop: The revered judge of six line plays. J-Roc: Uhhhh... Cynical maybe?  I'm not sure about him. Spence: not sure about the style yet, but I am certain his genius will put us all to shame. Katie: No clue, but the addition of the female sex is never a bad thing.  Man work sucked today!  I got soaked from head to toe and I mean SOAKED!!  The only good thing about it is money and one of the funniest pick up lines I have ever heard.  "How would you like to come to my place for some cock and pizza?" (Assuming girl looks pissed, shocked, annoyed, etc...) "What you don't like pizza?"  Might not be as funny as I thought but I liked it.  Might even try it out for fun... or not.  Last thing, I was not branded a tool because of my acceptance speech to the blog, it was becuase of the increasing weirdness of my posts, the weirdness is sligtly down at the moment, but the weirdness works in a cyclical fashion.   Try reading that last paragraph and not be confused. It sure cements my status as the Weird One.  Unfortunately, the quote to go with every post has died.  I think it's gone from original, to a little stale, to weird, to toolish, to just annoying.  And now a bunch of people copied me with quotes.  So the quote is dead and gone. RIP.  The tool (apparently) signing out

      Hi-Di-Ho Neighbours! (get it?! the whole ucc/bss thing...riiight)  Anyways, i can't tell you how much pressure I have been under in trying to make my first posting worthy.  It is quite the honour to be the first female with posting privileges- however it does come with some concern.  I don't know all of you that well, I don't go to ucc, and therefore cannot partake in all of the inside jokes (Klondikes?!, theatre studies, Adam Cooper etc.), so it begs the question "What am i going to talk about?!!?".  I have been thinking about this continuously and the first thing that came to mind would be to introduce all of you to me, Katie Stoneman... However, it was then brought to my attention that "Cooplander" did something similar, and ever since has been branded as 'a tool'...So ex-nay on that one.  I was now in need of some major wisdom, so i talked to Horkins, and with his extreme wisdomosity, he suggested on elaborating about dating ucc's most beautiful man...this is quite a good idea, however, the majority of people who read this blog happen to be male and in turn would become bored and slightly creeped out about hearing what it's like to go out with another guy.  Sooo, throughout my postings, i intend to inform all of you about important female things that i think most guys would enjoy hearing about...Kinda like Carey Bradshaws newspaper article in Sex and the City (CooplanderI wouldnt tell too many people that you like that show!!skkkketch!) So get pumped! Next posting"Poon Shivers" What are they and how do you get them?  Go Ducks Go!!!

      Go Ducks Go, Seventh Heaven tomorrow (Monday). It s good to have Spence back, I think everyone agrees with that. Btw I found an interesting article this weekend that discusses the very point that Spence was arguing. Did the US, by giving the rebels weapons during the Afghan-Soviet war, bring 9-11 upon themselves? A really good article Spence let me know if you want to take a look at it. Now JJ, what the f-ck happened? The Thespian's Guild Awards is supposed to have the "Hottest Chick Award". Second, 90% of the awards go to KR2 (set design doesn't even count because the only play that really had a set was the young comp.) yet Working is the play of the year (which i agree with). I think that you have sold Working's actors short, or maybe you need to re-evaluate some of your awards. Fourth, I think that "The Day They Killed some Bird" should get something, just watch out for those damn indoor Falcons.  Anyway, I am looking forward to Spence's comments about Nescafe Frothy (aka Ricci)'s play, "The Day They Killed a Duck". (In my opinion one of the worst displays of theatre, ever. Even worse than my set design.)  GO DUCKS GO

      Hey, this is weird, I'm listening to the soprano's theme song right... right... "Got yourself a gun" by like Alabama or something and then the next song that iTunes (great program btw... go macs!) randomly picks out of like 1000 other songs is "Got Yourself a Gun" by Nas... where he samples the previous song... WEIRD!  Anyways... this is another "awards list" thang that me and Matt "Cletis T. Fullernoy" Cowie come up with every year and he suggested I post it this year so here it is. It's basically an award show we came up with for UCC/BSS theatre. So we can give ourselves awards... great isn't it?   The Second Annual UCC Thespian's Guild Awards: The Tony Awards! copyright 2003 C. Horkins and M. Cowie    Best Play   Working (italics denotes winner) King Richard II Young Company  This is one that Matt (our Senior Show dude) conceded to me. We both agreed that the most energetic, hap'nin', git up and dance, show of the year deserved this year's Best Play award.   Best Actor   Matthew Cowie - Bolingbroke in KR2 Rich Ly- Roberto in Working Will Dick- Duke of York in KR2 Zach Sniderman- King in Henry X part 7 Dan Bernhard- Mike in Working  Was there ever any contest? Matt's performance as Bolingbroke blew any other leading actor's Mamet handbook out of their sorry hands. We even added Will and Rich to give this category some more credibility... honestly! MC-sqaured takes it.   Best Actress   Julia Cameron - King in KR2 Carleton Eckhart- Pam in Working Mercedes Grundy- Queen in KR2  Again, yeah there was really no question as to who should win here. With the whole chick playin' a dude thang pulled off with ease and just the general amazingness of her performance, Julia Cameron takes it (two years in a row btw...).   Best Supporting Actor   Curtis Westman - Aumerle in KR2 Ben Lewis- Conrad in Working Dan Goldbloom- Joe in Working Antony Dobrzenzsky- Gaunt in KR2 George Lace- Charlie in Working Chris Horkins- Rex in Working (there you go Matt, i totally do not deserve to be up here but you wanted it...)  With so many great performances by actors (so many we just HAD to nominate them all!) in supporting roles this was a tough decision. However, the great Curtis Westman, practically a Little Theatre legend these days, proved that with experience comes a really freakin' awesome performance. While some claim he was  shafted  this year, Curtis stepped into his role as the dark, rebellious Aumerle with an almost natural ease. As WT would say: "Good on yer"   Best Supporting Actress   Kate Whitelaw - Green/Fitzwater in KR2 Maya Janikowski- Roberta in Working Megan Loach- Grace in Working  We both agreed that Kate's performance was the best of any actress in a supporting role. The chick playin a dude factor was in effect as was the offstage death factor, the glove throwing factor, and the yellow glasses factor. A truly great performance.   Best Set Design   Working  King Richard II Young Company  Seeing as the KR2 set consisted of a throne, and a coffin, and the Young Co. was basically some furniture, and some painted screens made by Dave Steinbach (they were awesome Dave!), we decided that Working's awesome scaffolding deserved the set design award. Way to go James Weeke's and his physics class!   Best Breakthrough Performance   Jon Polubiec -Northumberland in KR2 Zach Sniderman- King in Henry X part 7 Dan Cheddie- Anthony in Working Clifford Chiu- Al in Working  Our annual award for the best performance by an actor new to the Little Theatre scene (for all intensive purposes this means first Upper School Play) was a surprisingly older award this year with several new seniors breaking onto the David Chu stage. However in the end it would have to be cleanliness advocate Jon Polubiec's performance as the badass Northumberland in KR2 that would take it.   Best Onstage Team   The Office Scene - Working  Bolingbroke and Northumberland - KR2 Ross and Willoughby- KR2 Ralph Werner and Charlie Blossom- Working  The funnest award this year (borrowed straight from the MTV awards) ended up in a tie! That's what you get when only two people vote on this... Matt's vote was for (surprise!) himself and his and Jon Polubiec's performance (of dubious teamliness). And my vote was for (surprise surprise!!) myself and the other 5 actors and actresses making up the hilarious, serious, office/cubicle scene from Working.  That's all of 'em. But wait, there is  one or two  more awards... the Award for "Hottest Chick" which was J-Roc's idea so I'll let him handle it if he wants to elaborate on who he decided deserved this year's honours. And as for the... worst actor award... i don't want to put any more hate up on this blog so I won't elaborate  best, cheddie   Till next time take it easy...

      In response to Horkins' maintainence of "Terrorism is real":  Terrorism is as real as Communism.  As real as the drug problem is now.  The War on Terror is as arbitrary, superficial and manipulative as the "war on communism" and the "war on drugs"  First, Communism:  After the second world war and before the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in 1989, the United States was at war with communism.  The read scares of the 1920s and 1950s are oddly similar to the terror scares of the 2000s.  The United States would assist knowingly corrupt and abusive regimes as long as they weren't communist.  In fact, starting in 1979, the United States supported and trained Osama bin Laden and his Taleban regime in order to fight off those scary Soviets.  Funny how things change.  Second, drugs:  Prior to 1937, smoking weed was legal in the states.  From 1919 thru to about 1929, drinking beer was not.  Despite the clear failure of both prohibitive initiatives, the government persists in their war on drugs.  More people have been incarcerated for drug charges in the United States that in every other country in the world COMBINED.   As Dennis Miller once said, "You can take away the drugs, but people will still spin around 'till they fall down and see God."  Terrorism is about as dangerous as pre-1989 Russia and as combatable as the kids smoking weed on frybrook.  Honestly, U.S. policy is so fucked up I can't contain my frustration.

      Spence, welcome back! And thank you for that example of free speech. I'd like to clear one thing up. Gwynn Dyer did not "burn" me when he spoke in assembly. If anything he made himself look stupid. I asked how he could call terrorism not really a threat after semptember 11th when 3000 people died in a terrorist attack, and the people responsible are still alive, and he proceeded to trivialise the deaths of those Americans who died that day. Dr. Dyer was inconsiderate to say that 3000 people wasn't a lot of people and that it didn't constitute a "threat". What if one member of his family was murdered and he knew the killer was on the loose, Would that be a threat? Terrorism is real. September 11th is more than enough of a scary precedent to justify removing threats to the safety of America. The War on Iraq was not some kind of first step towards a "Pax Americana", nor was it a war for oil, nor was it a war to "liberate Iraq", it was a war to remove the anti american threat (which did exist) in Iraq. I think a lot of people have forgotten the kind of emotions we all felt on September 11th 2001. With help from some emotional memory I think we can all find some empathy for what the United States are going through right now. War is not the answer, but sometimes it's the only way out.  But enough politics for now, I was out playing golf and who should be right behind me but Brooker "Smirnoff Ice" Belcourt. Not a good golf day for me... I can't believe I duffed my drive on the first hole in front of UCC's most beautifullest man. So ashamed right now.  Bateman, did you listen any of the 50 million times that Tompkins told us the Silken Tent was a large metaphor comparing a woman to a tent, not about a tent spider, or an actual woman and her tent, or even phallic imagery (bish)... And Cooper, I can't believe your phone went off that is hilarious "Who the f-ck is calling me?" LOL. The IB headquarters in Geneva must keep that shit for a rainy day... jokes... my review of the oral and rectal exam coming up sometime after 11:30 on monday.   Cooper I can't believe you thought our IB2s picture was good. It was like the worst one, except maybe for Brem... they had the backup "generic photo" after their pimps picture was turned down. Personally I give it to my homey Alex Richardson and Mowbray's for their basketball team photo... the black and whiteness was so key.  Well anyways thats enough for now... PEACE

      Heeeeeeeere's Johnny!  That's right, I'm back.  After a brief, albiet tough, sabattical due to "conduct probation", I have returned to save Flounder Online from succumbing to the horrors of mediocrity.  Now that I'm off conduct probation (I think -- Hood has yet to contact Lowndes to vouch for my character, which we all know to be stellar and a fine example of a UCC boy), I feel it is time to return to the joy of posting.    This post is actually focused on an element from the recent"tool" list by Cooper and a comment by h-kins.  Ignoring horkypoo's and Cooplander's DUBIOUS (to say the least) taste in music, a couple comments struck me as ignorant, musically and culturally retarded and completey oblivious to what's happening on our little planet.  Cooper called Matt Good a tool because "You're [sic] ego made your band break up, you're [sic] new album is ok, but you're still a tool."  Fair enough.  Matthew Good does have a huge ego (he did name his band after himself), but he does write, sing and compose all the songs.  Honestly, there are a million people out there who can drum and play the guitar, but talented singer/songwriters are few and far between.  However, it was Horkins' comment that really disturbed me: "Matt Good is stupid because he can't make a song/video without being so repulsively, blandly, fakely [sic], repetitively anit-america/establishment/the man/everyone who isn't me. Get a life man... I did buy MGB's last album though, it was alright [sic]. And also he is quoted so frequently by Nowers... what is up with that? Matthew aka Matt Good, you are a tool."  This makes me wonder has Horkypoo actually listened to any Matt Good song or watched any video besides "In a World called Catastophe"?  Furthermore, does he actually know what the fuck he's talking about when he says "anti-america/establishment/the man"?    As we ALL know, western democracy is the best way of life.  (Sense the sarcasm, boys.)  I'm sure horkins can sit in his forest hill home typing on his $2 000 computer and bitch about anti-establishmentarianism while "the establishment" caters to his every whim.  Matthew Good is an intelligent man, aware of what's going on, who happens to make kick-ass music about it.  Let's face the facts, dudes.    The United States of America has declared war on "terrorism"  In a speech by President Bush after 9-11, he issued the ultimatum, "You are either with us, or the terrorists".  There are no terrorists.  There is no global Al Qaeda conspiracy to dismantle the United States.  The U.S. was not, is not and never will be threatened by any global terrorist network.  Less than 3 000 people died on September 11.  Since the War - and we must call it war - began, tens of thousands have been killed, injured or displaced as a result of the U.S. led War on Terror.  I can only wonder how many more will die before we are "safe" from terror.   In March 2003, the United States invaded Iraq under the pretext of Iraq's posession of Weapons of Mass Destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.  Since then, an occupying force of over 140 000 personnel has yet to discover said weapons or links to terror.  Furthermore, threatening rhetoric has begun towards Iran, Syria and North Korea - rogue states, threats to democracy, enemies of the United States people.  A war with any of these countries will surely see more than 150 U.S. servicemen come home in bodybags and WAY more than the 6 000-odd civillians who died in the last war.  How many have to die before the U.S. people realize they are on a path to destruction.    We live in a time where aggressive and imperialistic foriegn policy is bolstered by CNN's sanitized and sensational warefare.  In a few years there will be no survivors of the bloody battles of WWII, Korea and Viet Nam.  Soon, the only wars we will know will be the Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq - the sanitized nightvision shots of bombs exploding over Bagdhad and Kabul.  Stories of the "rescue" of Jessica Lynch.  The "liberation" of Baghdad.  Suddenly, the absurd sensationalism of the yellow press during the Spanish - American War doesn't seem so archaic (see i have been studying.)  The world is still unsure as to what exactly the United States hopes to achieve with their unilateral pseudo-imperialistic and increasingly war-like foreign policy, but you can bet your Simple Plan concert tickets that if this sort of shit continues, we are all gonna be a hell of a lot worse off.  Horkins - You and I may be at opposite ends of the political spectrum, but you can't ignore the facts.  Rome was the original democracy - the first nation-state that spawned an empire.  The senate felt everyone should be so lucky as to fall under the grace of Rome, the benevolent, the democratic, the invincible.  Look what happened there.  You know how they say history repeats itself?  There is some truth to that...    Matt Good, despite his egomaniacal flaws, is a keen social commentator and an advocate of human rights.  To be anti-american does not mean one is anti-democratic or free speech or any of those luxuries we have come to feel we deserve along with our morning paper.  Anti-americanism can simple be the opposition to U.S. global dominance, which is growing and will continue to grow unless we get off our Lay-z-Boy and do something about it.  As we enter the 21st century, distracted by our menagerie of shiny objects and CNN's "War in ____", I pray we don't succumb to the Pax-Americana that threatens to supersize, homogenize, and ultimately destroy the earth as we know it.  "Fake lightning flashes over the skyline.  A deer in your headlights. So gun it, gun it, gun it, gun it.  We're singing songs about 21st century living.  There's hate in your heart, man.  You'll take what you're given."                          "21st Century Living"  - Matt Good - Avalanche.  If you can't discern what he's talking about, they probably have a place for you on the Bush foreign policy committe.  Peace.  ( I Hope.)

      Yes JJ, Ricci has changed over the past year, damn those falcons. Coopster, watching Sex and the City to catch glimpses of Sarah Jessica Parker, is not cool, just weird. But then again you do go to a tanning salon....... (jokes man)   It is a rather remorseful weekend, the season finale of Trailer Park Boys is tomorrow, I know it is no Fastlane or Cooper's beloved Sex and the City, but it is unfortunate to say goodbye to the boys of Sunnyvale Trailer Park for another year. Anyway, 9pm on Showcase tomorrow (Sunday) night. Now I must say that Hudson is not the only one to mess up on his oral commentaries, with the legendary Robert Wayne Tompkins, I too fell victim to those damn shit hawks after my critique of Robert Frost's "The Silken Tent" apparently it is not about some creature and it's tent, it is actually a woman and her physical (not metaphorical) tent. Well i fucked that one up, all I got to say about it, Systems was pretty good though.  "This is by far the best idea I've ever had, I mean dope goes for a way more awesomer price in jail, you know supply in command, I mean when you're in jail you're lucky to get stoned once a week and when you do the dope sucks. I mean I don't see anything wrong with having dope in jail, and if there is going to be dope in jail we may aswell be the ones supplying it."  GO DUCKS GO

      In regards to the yearbook I would like to congratulate Howard's IBI for the most original grade picture of all the IBI's. Jackson's comes a close second for having their entire IBI and IB2 in the picture.  The most original IB2 yearbook photo goes to Mchughs for the trippy art.  Martlands and Jacksons come second for men in dresses and men without shoes respectively.  By the way I don't think I ever congratulated my house for winning the PREFECT'S CUP!!!!!  Howards: King of Houses, did you ever think you would see the day? Last note on the yearbook, everyone check out Bryan Kee's photo in the leaving class section, check out what is in cianflone's mouth.  4 down and 2 to go!  Unfortunately, one of those 2 is History.  Chris, Systems was extremely chilling compared to anything that leaves the history wing.  I am very fucked for history. Fuck Russia. Fuck the Depression. Fuck Mexico. etc.... oh and fuck censorship. Heh heh WHORRS heh heh. Wait, that wasn't funny and the censorship was stupid and useless.  Man Friday's can suck when everyone is either studying or crunked out (Andrew!!)  Even when you have the car there is nothing to do!  I had the choice of watching Matrix reloaded alone, or playing NHL 2003.  Neo was never in my sight line.  Actually I am downloading a shitty version of M2 off Kazaa right now anyways (stealing is fun).  And under recomendation from Flounder I will soon download a pirated copy of Bruce Almighty.  Unless, it wins something I ain't paying, oh and I'll pay when I go with les filles (the ladies for all you french illiterates).  Finally, Sex and the City is not too bad of a show on a boring Friday night, you just have to learn when to listen.  90% of the show is constant babble, but the chicks are hot, very hot MILF's. 12:05 on Bravo.   "But I promise not to cry anymore" The Dears - Lost in the Plot  Cooplander (invented by David Riesman, story coming soon, stay tuned) signing out  P.S.

      Two matters of business:   UCC Exam Marathon Update #3    Systems : I knew this would be the hardest one yet. And it was. While most people, like Matt "he's not exactly doing mamet here" Cowie, will tell you it was easy, I disagree... disagree old skool! This exam was tough. I kept finishing the papers early and being like, wow, maybe I should have written more, not guessed so much, and studied a lot more. Although it would be freakin impossible to cover all the material on this exam. Paper 2 was based on a lab that's due next year! I haven't started it yet! How am I supposed to know that shit! There's always one that spoils your roll... and to clarify Dr. Hamr is still the man (he's invincible, he could give me a 1 and be the man...)  Chillness Factor : 1/2 of a klon out of 5 (practically warm...)  order number two: I just saw the new Jim Carrey movie "Bruce Almighty" which received mixed reviews from Eric "Esticlaaaaaade" Estey, and Matt "Number 2 with 5 stylish new suits for $50" Cowie, ranging from "it was pretty bad" to "it was alright". I tended to air on the more praising side, it's a Jim Carrey movie how bad could it be, but really Jim Carrey makes this movie, with any other actor it would have absolutely sucked. Although that Jennifer Aniston (so hot right now...). Anyways, some good laughs, it's not a classic like "Dumb and Dumber" or "The Mask" or, or, "Ace Ventura 2: When Nature Calls"... but its still Jim Carrey back doing what he does best....  okay three orders of business: We saw Brooker "Squash is not just a tasty vegetable" Belcourt and his girlfriend, the blog's number 1 fan, Katie who had just seen the Matrix. A pleasure to finally meet someone who enjoys what we post here so much. Big Shoutouts, guys.  okay... actually there's four orders of business:  This is a good one, it's another list but a coool list. I present you with the 180 Awards! The 180 Awards is given to the top 5 people (uh... at UCC) who have made a 180 degree turn in their personality this year. So without any further adue the 180 Awards...  1. Adam Cooper: just one look at the Howard's page of the yearbook makes you realise that the Adam Cooper pictured there is NOT the same person as the new, improved, more evenly tanned Cooplander we know today. From the copious amounts of gel in the hair, to the bronze godliness, as WT said "It's the birth of a new Cooper!" (i think it's a change for the better)  2. Will Dick: The same great guy and friend throughout the year but he really did change from the stylish suit wearing, bowler hat toting energetic theatre dude we knew in FY to this year's more mature, Frybrook frequenting, dark, seafoam and orange shirt sporting  cool  Will Dick we know now. As Antony Dobrzensky, who brought this to my attention, put it "You know at the beginning of the year he was all full of energy on the stage, and the other day I see him all crouched up between two cars on Frybrook (so no one could see him) taking a puff." What happened? Tobacco and Chloe Brown. Will, I love you man, but you pulled a 180 on us.  3. "Nino" Ricci: This guy was pretty cool in my books at the beginning of the year. Now he has been declared by Bateman as the "Tool of the Year". While I wouldn't exactly call him the most toolish person at UCC, I would say several toolish deeds have caused his steady rise into tool-hood. Like screwing up our scale for the Theatre project leaving us open to a barrage of insults from Spence. I hate to be a falcon here, but nescafe has really pulled a 180 nearing the end of this year. As J-ROC here said "Now I had suggested that he be the tool of the year, but it was deemed by the judges panel that he sheer toolness had only been at its peak for a maximum of two terms. But what a fucking tool!"  4. James Black: Well, he's pretty much the same guy. But he became a boarder. That's a 180 if you ask me. In the words of me "Black's a boarder?"    5. Me: Yeah that's right, me. I sure pulled a 180 on myself this year. First of all, I actually had a pretty big role in two different plays (wow thats a first). Then I actually joined a sports team, b-ball, albeit as a manager... which introduced me to rap music, which I began to write. Now I own a fake 50 cent bling. And speaking of NYC... that was a pretty different experience there... I think I've changed a lot this year, but still remained somewhat the same... in the words of Bateman "i dunno man honestly? i think that you have changed alot"  so there you go... 180 awards feel free to comment.

      Coopster. SHUT UP with the lists man! That is one list too many man hmm k? They need to be special, not just like the top 100 people you hate today, just letting you know, the music one was ok though. I have been taking some criticism for changing my tool of the year winner. The simple fact is that when you see Ricci walking anywhere in the school, you just want to hit him with a blunt metallic object of some kind (just playing). First of all I read his flyer (which I kept to make me laugh when I am feeling down after an exam) and it is just to funny. "He was a boy like you. He fell victim to the falcons (aka shit hawks). A dove has been killed." I still haven't seen these fucking falcons. Thats the first thing, who honestly makes a flyer for their fucking theatre presentation. (I could see it for a Math Studies presentation eh, Mr. Griffin?) Second, who the fuck takes notes on their $5000 dollar laptop, that they bring to school. Fourth thing is, that he is driven around in a Hummer H2, by his driver (who doesn't even buy him beer). That pretty much somes it up. Ok? Good.  JJ, you saying that the tool of the year is based upon my 'Car jealousy' that is complete BS. The shit hawks should be shitting on you for that. Conor has a car, Brooker practically has a car, there are many people with cars. Its just that when people think they know everything under god's green earth about cars, when they know absolutely nothing just pisses me off, cause they're all full of such shit. Anyway, that Math Methods exam (middle math) was messed up.  "He just waltzes in there and becomes king of the carts. What the ph-ck does he think im sposed to do? Go down to EI? Hi there, yeah I haul shopping carts out of ponds for a living and sell them back to the store, Ive been doing it for 18 years, now give me a ph-cking check please! Thats not gonna ph-cking happen, I havent been paying into UI, EI whatever the ph-ck they call it these days." -Bubbles

      Before today's exam update, I hafta get one thing out of the way. Former blog member John Spence confronted me today on the fact that the blog has "gone downhill" since he left, and yes his absence contributed to that, but the main thing (from him, not me) is that its become a "pissing contest" between cooper and me talking about the biggest tools in pop music, so that ends here. Anyways...   UCC Exam Marathon Update #2    Math Studies - Normally a studies exam wouldn't be so ominous and looming for me, but I hadn't really paid much attention this term and some bad test results led me to think this would be a very difficult exam.... boy was I wrong. Wow, was it just me? or was that a really easy exam? No, it was an easy exam. First of all, the questions were all easy and straightforward, they all told you what to do, and most of them how to do it (that formula booklet is like cheating... only it's not!) Basically if you could operate a TI-83 (or any of the TI family of calculators) and had a pulse, you pass this exam. Although once again, i may have completely misjudged this one... but if I did I am one stupid dipshit because that exam was freakin easy.  Chillness Factor:  7 klons out of 5    Next time on Exam Update...  Yeah, I am really shitting my pants over Systems, I can't believe I put it 4 on my pre exam list of hardness... it is gonna be really hard. I want to study but something tells me I'm gonna be designing the new FOL Gear (it's happening soon, get your credit cards ready). But yeah, Systems will be tough. All that environmental and systems... aaaah! I'm gonna be studying, unlike Matt "I never miss theatre, even when The View is on!" Cowie who is going to see this BSS drama night thing of Alice in Wonderland with SConnor's girlfriend as Alice or something... have fun Matt. We'll see how it goes tommorrow. Until then, I'm out. Have a nice day and take it easy, go treat yourself to a slushie or something. I suggest blueberry.  here's a cooper-esque quote (from the tmnt site!): One can pay back a loan of gold, but one dies forever in debt to those who are kind. - Malayan Proverb -   those Malayan's, always with their proverbs...

      Yo wat up my peeps?  Hope you're all having a fun exam week (the irony is just so delicious!)  Two down and 4 to go!  I did French yesterday and English today.  I got called on my cell phone in the middle of my oral commentary.  That couldn't sound good on the tape, "The metaphor here helps to the theme of the poem because" "RING! RING!" "Who the fuck is calling me?"  Yes that's right I said fuck in front of the English Guru Tompkins. He did not look all too pleased. Whoever called me's gonna get their neck rung (i need caller id). Anyways the rest of that exam went smoothly, and all is well in the land of Cooplander.  Chris, yo man you're right Miller can be a grade A asshole, that was jokes man.  Almost as funny as DEREK FREAKIN' LEUNG getting a gating!  I thought that kid was immune from punishment let alone doing anything wrong. Yes french was a joke (i just hope i don't fail now or i'll look like a jackass) and on systems i'll probably be one of the guys saying I should have paid attention, history too. The exam marathon update thing is total jokes man, how the hell do you come up with all this shiz-niz? Jks.  Anyways, I have been racking my brain already preparing to supply you with goodies at camp (I want that feeling of winningness) you will not be dissapointed (unless I forget, which I probably will). The blog will be lost without you. Finally, you're little tool artist list included pop stars, since you give me this opening I will deliver.  #1,2 and #3 tool in the singing world....(drum roll).....  Jennifer Lopez!   Why you ask me? Fine, but you asked for it, this even deserves its own paragraph.  Jennifer Lopez:  Firstly, she says she's from the block but she ain't.  Found out she went to a private school in New York, you gotta be rich to afford private school in the US.  She even tries to make money off this "street" image.  Secondly, she ignores her fans.  While shooting the Jenny from the Block video, she ignored a bunch of children FROM THE BLOCK some po' kids just wanting to bask in her famousness (i love making up words), she just brushed them off!  What a bitch!  Thirdly, she says the reason she broke up with P Diddy (I still hate him) is because he did not want to stay at home every night, she wanted him whipped!  And the reason this ended their relationship... because she suspected he was cheating when he went out. How?  Because he was late?  She has even said there was no physical evidence on him, she just "knew"?  Yeah that'll hold up in court.  Or maybe she broke up with him because he was on trial for murder, I guess she doesn't feel like helping anyone when they are down, she just likes to kick 'em. (I still hate diddy, but in this situation he represents men in general)  Lastly, she is just like any other pop artist, she doesn't write her own songs.  "Ain't it Funny?"  Written by Chantel Krababakkdkfas.... (I don't know how to spell her name, so sue me) every other popular song?  Collaborations with popular artists, Ja Rule, LL Cool J, etc... How can you be good when you can no longer do a good song by yourself?  The last successful song she did by herself was Play.  That was in 1999 (or something like that) a long time ago!  I could go on for much longer, but that would just suck all the fun out of it for me.  So in conclusion, J LO sucks! I told you I didn't want to include pop Chris, but you gave me an opening.  Sorry for all the hate chris but it started with the tool of the year, hopefully this will be the last "hate" article on the Flounder Online. Crap now I have to come up with a quote.  A bird does not sing because it has an answer -- it sings because it has a song.   Coopster, Cooper, Cooplander (all acceptable names), signing out  PS Brooker, any girl that is a fan of the Flounder Online is solid in my books so peace out to BB and KS (together forever!)

      UCC Exam Marathon Update:   French : The first exam, and easiest so far, for many, SL French turned out to be exactly what was expected and less. The same old same old reading comp stuff came up (some article about how snails like to eat paint...) and then there was a composition, where I wrote a letter to Jean-Paul Sartre. I must have been done like 4 hours early and it was a 2 hour exam. I spent half the time drawing pictures of Mr. Miller (that dick wouldn't let me have my water bottle because it wasn't clear "how do i know it's water?" you wanna see you old cock? what an ass...) Wow. If I failed this exam then I must be mentally retarded.  Chillness Rating : 5 klons out of 5  (can you think of a better scale?)   Geo : IB1 Geo students felt they could look forward to a challenging exam that could potentially cover more material than... uh... a really big blanket! And it did! This exam was tough. Chose 2 of 3 different big 25 mark questions on the following chapters: sustainable development/population, urbanisation, and malnourishment/agriculture. So basically the whole year was on this exam. Luckily you could pick and choose stuff you knew to some extent, unfortunately you needed a lot of MDC/LDC examples, I tried to incorporate as much as I knew. Is there a food shortage in Kenya? There better be... Mens better be impressed by my charts, maps and sketches. Overall this was a tough exam which required hand cramping amounts of writing crammed into a 1.5 hour period (barely enough time). I think I handled it pretty well though.  Chillness Rating : 3 klons out of 5  (can you think of a better scale?)  Next time on Exam Update: Math Studies: "Wow, I am the smartest kid and studies is truly for retards, whoa studies!!"  or  "I'm serious it's actually not that easy! Shut up Chris Li!" ???  and perhaps...  Systems: "Dr. Hamr, you are the greatest teacher ever."  or  "maybe I should've paid attention all year in this class..." ???  And on a side note a big shout out to brooker's girlfriend and her friends that read the blog, it's become clear to me that this blog actually has "fans", groupies even, and she is apparently the no. 1 fan of the blog. So yeah, shout outs.  Take it easy y'all.

      Ian came up with a pretty good idea today (he was due...): seeing as over the month of July (starting june 25th) I will be at camp as a CIT and unreachable by blog, email, icq, and throwing a rock at my house... infact I will only be reachable by good old fashioned snail mail (you know, with stamps). So here's the deal, Ian has already agreed to send me many letters and care packages (i wonder what will be in them?) cause I'm such a cool guy... so here's the deal. Whoever sends me the coolest shit wins... and this goes to everyone not just the blog members, all you avid readers can participate. But the rules are  1. No candy. (it's a camp rule okay, I love candy but hey, they'll take it away...)  2. No Porn (that would just be wrong)  3. Nothing horribly innapropriate... i guess... (rules come in threes okay.) Feel free to include copies of The Source/XXL/Slam/Nintendo Power (i dunno i needed a fourth one). Locks of hair will not be appreciated (that means you cooper). And the winner gets... winningness and something cool yet to be determined.  so anyways here's the address:  Chris Horkins c/o Camp Ponacka 376 Ponacka Rd. Highland Grove, ON K0L 2A0  have fun homeys

      Coopster. I love the combo list, the ricci being on it is just jokes...  But what's up with you trashing my homeboy Sean "P.diddy/Puffy/Comb-daddy/D-to-the-I-to-the-D-D-Y" Coombs. I know he may seem like rap's biggest tool at first (Dude can't even put out a decent 16 bars without help from Usher/Busta/Faith Evans/Mase about 6 years ago, and he's been riding the Biggie thing for a long time now) but seriously he does put out some good stuff. And he "makes it hot". You just hafta read the article about him I read in The Source (yes I read The Source...). And yes Matt Good is stupid because he can't make a song/video without being so repulsively, blandly, fakely, repetitively anit-america/establishment/the man/everyone who isn't me. Get a life man... I did buy MGB's last album though, it was alright. And also he is quoted so frequently by Nowers... what is up with that? Matthew aka Matt Good, you are a tool.  Who really should be on there are the following -Ja Rule: on the wrong side of a rivalry with the most popular rapper these days (good music, though...) he just acts like a tool. I saw a "behind the scenes" video and all he did was bitch about stupid shit "they said it might rain!" and show off his recording studio at his house.... what a tool -Bjork: Okay, Rich Ly may like her, but I just go "what the fuck?" every time I see her... what a tool -Theory of a Deadman: when you're going to copy another band, at least you could pick someone better than NickelBack... what a bunch of tools -NickelBack: see above... tools -The  Other  guys in N*Sync: Come on Chris, Joey, Lance, stand up for yourselves... Justin totally bitches you guys around... honestly you all have to be at least 5 years older than him, get a solo career instead of that freaking ride to the moon. And tell JC Chasez to get a haircut. He looks like wheels from the original degrassi...  What a Bunch of freaking tools.

      Just got to clarify a couple of things, firstly Bateman, I do like go-karting, which i said in my post.  All I said was that burnt my elbows on the tires because I am a lanky bastard.  Secondly, the only reason I brought up Gob in my post on the Horkins Top 5 list is because I was listening to them at the time.  Cause' you know what Horkins you're right, Gob is not that great, but spend a little money on the Linkin Park album and you will find out that it is well worth the money. Better than the first album.  These guys work hella hard!  They spent a week just on the artwork for the album, the wait for this album was well worth it.  Bateman you hit the nail on the head with Ricci. I walked in on the end of the presentation and it looked like one huge acid trip with him on the floor and crazy coloured lights going on and off. By the way the coversheet was so f---ing egotistical! Stop sucking up!  Horkins the list is cool.  And since I like both the tool of the year and the current top 5 artists by Horkins i've decided to combine the two.  Presenting the Top 5 Tools in Music (music is limited to rock and rap because I don't listen to dance and pop is just so full of tools that it would be impossible to determine just 5).  1. Staind 2. Matt Good 3. P Diddy 4. James Ricci 5. Scott Wieland (lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots)  Explanations: Staind: Shitty new album, no effort, just reusing old formula, badly. Matt Good: You're ego made your band break up, you're new album is ok, but you're still a tool. P Diddy: If he never puts out another album the world will be blessed. Bad Boy for life? You just a tool. James Ricci: His performance on Friday qualifies him, got guts for going up but damn, one pick a song you can sing, and shove down your ego maybe 2 to 8 notches. Scott Wieland: You got caught with Heroin again you dumbass! You've already been through rehab once before, stick to the light stuff (m-jay and e)  That's how I see it and if you don't like it you can suck my motherfu--ing...  "A cynic is someone who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing." (have I used this one before?)  Peace out to all my homies in the crowd!

      I'm sorry but the only way Nescafe Frothy is getting a 7 in theatre is if he had a special "oral exam" with hoody, know'm sayin? The only good part of that dove play were the production values (ie lighting, sound, etc.). In fact I would go as far as saying he had the best production values of any theatre presentation this year complete with grade nines skipping class to do his lighting (how many hummers did that take? nudge nudge wink wink). However, unfortunately for Rolo this is a script writing project and this script made no f-cking sense whatsoever, and was a hackneyed portrayal of the ever so original gay teen suicide story. Nice try though, I hope Hoody was as impressed with the flashy lights as I was.  And Ian, my brother  still  doesn't want to buy your go-kart.  Radiohead is awesome, as I stated, our convo a couple days ago prompted some relistening to some of their old tunes and the new listening of their new song "there there". Quality music that. Oasis and Weezer just seem to be off the radar right now and I'm not paying much attention to them...  But hey this is a good track I found. Search for (on kazaa/limewire or whatever): "Back That Ass Up" by New Found Glory a punk cover of the original Juvenile joint... its pretty intense.  And here are some fun links for an exam study break from our friends at Joe Cartoon, flies get exposed to human forms of intoxication, hilarity ensues:  urlLink Supafly 1: 3 drunk flies   urlLink Supafly 2: Publick Service Announcement   urlLink Supafly 3: Stone Flies   Payce out

      Go Ducks Go indeed JJ. Cooper man that was toolish thing to say, go karting is the shit. If you think you know everything about after one time you are a tool (just kidding man, besides, you did come clean with your hypocritism so its kool). On that note, I have a go kart for sale, $500 bucks, let me know if you're interested.   The BIG ANNOUNCEMENT is however, the first two winners in our tool of the year category have been reversed. The reason? Ricci is just too much of a fucking tool, after colaborating with others, I have decided to reverse the numbers. Why? Today in the library Ricci was studying eventhough he didn't have an exam today. But that is beside the point.... He said that he is going to get a 7 in theatre this term because he is going to ace his exam. This act cannot go unnoticed, first of all he thinks that he is so good at everything, second he said that he got a 7/6+ on The Day They Killed a Dove, this is just too much to take. For those of you who weren't privaleged enough to see this montage of crap, apparently there are shit hawks or smthn like that flying around daily shitting on gay kids. Well it appears that Ricci has alot of experience with these shit hawks., and that people put guns in their gazebos for no apparent reason, except to have their gay son kill themselves. That is really realistic! Well Ricci, I guess I am a shit hawk, YOU FUCKING TOOL!   I see JJ has updated his favourite artists, and Coldplay does deserve to be up there (not as good as Oasis though, or Weezer) but they are amazing, its a shame theatre guys can't see them at the amphitheatre, that would be an amazing show. But the surprise of the list is Radiohead. Great Band, but JJ I was wondering where this came from? Let me know what songs you like, btw Creep is an amazing song.  Anyway, Ricci big tool!  GO DUCKS GO

      Go Ducks Go! The Ducks are on a roll baby, they are comin back! That overtime goal by Salei was the most beautiful overtime goal I have ever seen. Wow. Quack Quack Quack.  Coop, it's cool man... I'm comfortable with my sexuality (which is hetero btw... in case you were wondering... okay, I just want to make sure that's clear okay.) I love Go-Karting man, that sh-t is off the hook.  Gob... I dunno. I'm diggin the song they did on NHL 2003, but the whole "real punk music" thing escapes me. Why listen when the pop punk (aka "fake" punk) sounds so much better. And Linkin, I'm feelin the new one "somewhere I belong" but just not enough for top 5 action.  Payce, and good luck for all y'all with an exam tommorrow... P

      Well Coopster, I was kinda looking forward to The Punisher. If it's just a little bit better than DareDevil (what a piece of crap that was) then it might be worthwhile. But what we really need is another Batman. A GOOD Batman, like the "Dark Night" batman not the fuckin Joel Shumacher Batman, and not played by Ashton Kutcher (that better be just a bad rumor). But whatever, Blockbuster movies suck more than half the time anyways.  In other news, I finally got my G1. That computer test was dope and the dude at the DMV was a chiller too. He was all like "Way to go buddy, you passed!" and I was all like "THank you".   In other other news: STONES CONCERT TOMMORROW! Oh, wait did I say Stones Concert? I mean Justin Timberlake Concert! How messed is that line up it's like Blue Rodeo, The Guess Who, Rush, ACDC, The Stones, and... Justin Timberlake? Let's hope he doesn't jam in with the other dudes and try to beatbox or some stupid shit like that. But seriously this concert is gonna be fa'reaaaaal! If you aren't going, what the fuck is wrong with you, watch it on tv fool.

      Horkins it is good to have you back.  I don't know of anyone who stimulates more discussion on the FOL than thou.  Yes you would be right that I should never in my lifetime make any attempt at rapping, rhyming or dropping a beat.  It was a failure of epic proportions.  Anyways you were missed.    Timing is everything.  At least that's what I'm telling myself right now.  While daydreaming at work today I thought that maybe since I have nothing to talk about on the blog that I should review a couple movies I saw over the summer.  It couldn't be a worse idea than my rapping.  So I log on to the blog read down and... ARGGGHHH!!  Horkins ya beat me to the punch.  I guess great minds think alike... or it was just a very odd coincedence, probably the latter since I am far from a great mind.  Here is my contribution, notice that my grading system is slightly different from H-Kin's.   The Hulk  I came into this movie not expecting much, but I was pleasently surprised.  The writers were able to adapt Stan Lee's classic comic to the silver screen amazingly.  I admit I never read or saw anything Hulk related until this movie, but the plot actually made a lot of sense.  I will not give you a total run down of the plot but let's say it filled in some holes that my friends explained for me from the comics.  A few key things I'd like to mention: using frames to give the effect of an actual comic book was kinda cool, the relationships between the four major characters was very well thought out and original and my favourite part was the short walk by cameos by Stan Lee and the actor who played the Hulk in the live action series.  The only drawback of the movie was the awful CGI.  The Hulk looked like a poor man's Shrek.  Very badly done.  As well the fight scenes seemed to unrealistic, at one point Hulk caught a missle bit off the top and threw it back at a helicopter, right...  As well Hulk seemed too invincible, it just makes any sequels set up for disaster.  But overall I enjoyed this movie thoroughly so I give it...  3.75 hair gel bottles out of 5    28 Days Later  Now this movie really struck a cord with me.  Think The Stand meets Planet of the Apes.  Man wakes up out of a coma 28 days after a disease is released into the world from apes.  This disease turns humans into bloodthirsty, half animal, half human beasts, who want to kill all humans and the disease is highly contagious to the point where a scratch from these beasts can infect you.  Within 15 seconds of infection the people transform.  I know kinda out there.  Anyways the movie takes a great look at human's will to survive.  The crappy production quality actually helps with the plot of the movie because everything seems blear and dreary.  The only negative I have for this movie is that the ending is a total cop out, tool ending.  In conclusion, this movie is a must see for any fan of horror.  4.5 hair gel bottles out of 5   Anyone else realize how desperate for ideas Hollywood is?  First you have Terminater 3 and next summer we will be getting The Punisher.  Oh and American Wedding will probably blow ass.  My favourite joke of the moment... How many people with ADD does it take to screw in a lightbulb? How many? Wanna go for a bike ride?  Trust me its funny if someone is actually telling it to ya.  Lates

      I'm actually kinda disappointed that I'm being allowed to post only once a day yet still be the only guy posting three days in a row. Not cool folks, post it up.  So I saw this "Pirates of Caribbean" business last night and I realised, I freakin love pirates. I know it's not quite in line with the  urlLink ninja  thang but hey, pirates are cool nonetheless. And this movie was seriously good despite how crappy it may have looked in the previews. Which is exactly the opposite of Terminator 3 (viewed in beautiful Haliburton's Molou theatre on night off), which is probably the biggest letdown of a film I have ever seen... you know what, I'm startin this all over again.   H-kins' Summer Movie ROUND-UP!    Matrix Reloaded  Really awesome fight scenes, the plot was pretty intense and too hard for my non-geek brain to understand at times. Lots of gratuitous sex.   3.5 Pizzas out of 5    Bruce Almighty  Definitely not a Jim Carrey Classic, but funny nonetheless. Interesting concept. A good romantic comedy if nothing else. not bad, but also not good.  2 Pizzas out of 5    The Italian Job  Great Action sequences, sweet Mini chase (makes you want Luca's car... I'm serious). Charlize Theron is HOT.  5 Pizzas out of 5    T3: Rise of the Machines  This is NOT a sequel to T2, this is a disgrace to the Terminator franchise. Great action is squeezed in at innopportune moments. The plot is weak and the ending is disappointing.  1 Pizza out of 5    Pirates of the Carribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl  PIRATES! Swashbuckling action, an intense plot combining legend, adventure, and the open sea. The best movie based on a ride ever made.  5 Pizzas out of 5   Feel free to add to this if you've seen more than I have.  And that's all I got.

      URrrgh... it's raining. If the weather here has been like it was up at camp then this summer's weather has royally sucked since mid-july. I mean what the hell God? Summer is WARM! Or supposed to be... and it's fuckin global warming too huh? Except for the fact that it doesn't snow in winter anymore I seem to be unable to see the proof of this "climate change". Or am I just retarded.  Why does the weather matter? Because you see, I can give a fuck less if it rains all day today through tuesday, but if it rains anything more than a drop on wednesday then I'm a kill someone. Why? Because as you all should know wednesday is the Molson CAnadian Rock for Toronto concert (an outdoor affair) starring none other than the world's greatest rock n roll band The Rolling Stones, among others (ACDC, The Guess Who, Rush, etc.). And Ian "the world's greatest friend in the world" Bateman has got tickets. So weather just tone this rain stuff down by Wednesday okay? Cool.

      I'm BAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!  S'right... I just got off the bus back from the sunny shores of Camp Ponacka (aka Pornacka) where I thoroughly enjoyed fulfilling my role as one of 14 Counselours In Training (CITs), which is basically a nice word for the guys who pay money to come and do all the the bitch-work and maybe if they're really good we'll let them be counselours next year. But it really was a great time. Our cabin was packed with 14 of the coolest guys I've ever had the privelege to spend time with. Some old friends (one dude I'v been in the same cabin as for like 8 years) and some new ones (5 guys crossing over from August camp) including a prettyboy even prettier than Matthew Cowie himself (I know it's blasphemy but it's true). We worked our butts off and hopefully I'll have the privelege of teaching kids the fine arts of Pottery, Nature, and/or Lapidary (the art of turning rocks into semi-precious stones... uh... ask Steinbach) next year.  So anyways... no one sent me shit so you all lose the contest. I got one letter and it was from my mom... so my mom wins. Cowie, you were supposed to get me chickmail... i was disappointed. And what has happened to this site lately? Honestly this is the Cooper and Bateman show... and after reading cooper's first post after I left I decided not to read his other ones, never rap again. Bateman you're good but on your own it's just not enough Bishy and Spence lit up the site briefly but there needs to be more variety really... Anyways I hope people still read this crap...  Ian, how did you find out your teachers for next year? I hope I'm in your english class again with Wayne, that was good times.  And on the subject of Report Cards, it seems I have slipped from 34 to 33 due to a move back to a 5 in Geo without the compensating move back up in Systems... overall my exam marks were really good, except for the 66 in systems (note to self: study next year). I was really surprised to see I got a 90 on my oral commentary, I thought I sucked it up big time... but Wayne is such a great guy he said I was ready for IB2 work... yeahyeah!   And on a closing note our new principal's name is Dr. Power, but sadly his first name is not Max.   Maaaax Power! The man with the name you would love to touch... but you must not tooooouch!  -Homer Simpson

I'm not gonna check every day if we only post once every two weeks.  I'm looking at Spence, Hudson, Bishop, et al. to begin posting again.  It kills me to see this site get dragged down by someone other than me.  If anyone is going to make this site crap it will be me and my stupidity, at least then I could be the scapegoat, I'm used to it.  Just post more boys. Pretty Please.  Lates

      OK guys Im sorry for not posting in a while, but my internet is down right now and I am currently using the computer in the WAC Office (I'm on Lunch). Anyway, work has been ok, better at times lately but that is about it.  Last week I went to see an incredible movie, it was just so good words can't describe it. Charlies Angels Two: Full Throttle was the shit, I'm sorry but it was just so unbelievable good there was this one scene where Cameron Diaz is out on her surf board, it was money. The ending was weak and this motorcycle chase was really bad, and there were a couple of other really bad parts, but some parts were really good, McG (the director) also directs Fastlane, and lets just say that this movie was as good if not better than some episodes of Fastlane, yes it was that good, I just hope that they make a Charlies Angels 3. There is only one movie that will be able to top it, The Shape of Things Movie, coming soon to a theatre near you.  Now since I am in the dirty WAC/OMP office I have come across an email sent by David Canella, it reads:   Fellow Comrads,  My name is David Canella and I am the associate chair of the 19th annual Ontario Model Parliment. You have been chosen to take part in prestigious roles in the executive committee if the simulation in 2004. You were selected because of your keen interest and valuable skills. If you have a genuine interest in politics, administration, similarly inclined colleagues of the opposite sexual persuation or just free food, like the Bapoo, then the OMP Exec is meant for you.....  (it kind of keeps going on for a bit)  Where the fuck do they come up with some of this shit? Honestly, what the fuck does "similarly inclined colleagues of the opposite sexual persuation" mean? I guess thats why Im not in OMP, man Canella know wonder you were one of the tools of the year. What a fucking tool.

      Well Cooper see you in August man, I know you'll have some crazy stories to tell us. Anyway moving on, I got some feedback so I'll post it now.   Anonymous............  I agree heartily with John's suggestion that Cooplander's reckless posting must stop permanently. John referred to posting as a 'right'  "I only motion that Adam Cooper's posting rights be suspended indefinately,"  however posting on Flounder Online is not a right, it's a privilage, one that Cooplander has abused copiously as of late. As a loyal Flounder fan, and possibly one of the only remaining ones due to the plethora of crap that comes from Cooplander's computer, I would hope that Cooplander can be halted before his mindless drunken babble destroys what is left of Flounder's fan base.  Well that was pretty harsh, but justified we don't post for the sake of posting, when we have something to say we say it. Even if it is a slow week and you know we're not doing anything we don't post. I mean no one wants to hear me saying I crossed the street like 5 times today.  Yesterday, I went to see  Bowling For Columbine  with Will Dick, a former blogger. It was really good, if you haven't seen it, you should there are really funny parts but it makes you think. Highly recommend it, it was the best movie I've seen this year. Michael Moore is the epitamy of the shit disturber species. There was this bit with one of the guys who was a well known associate of Timothy McVeigh, and they were talking about weapons and Moore asked what the worst thing he had ever made was, the guy was making 5 gallon jugs of homemade napalm, for self defense I'm sure. Another bit was with this guy who had a hat saying "Fuck Everybody" in Michigan who said that it was possible for anybody to be an enemy, he also said that he stole guns and then went into Detroit and sold them to gangs there. Will has got his G2 and been driving and he drove us down to the movie, sketchy..... but fun cause Will is pretty jokes about the whole thing. Yeah I was holding on pretty hard throughout the whole thing. Farouk is far worse though, the guy just runs red lights cause he is in the wrong lane.  "Do you wanna see how much I can take? Can't you just leave bad love alone?..." -Sunday's Best

      Under intense criticism and now on "conduct probation" I feel it is finally time to take a break.  Until JJ returns I will remain silent in the shadows.  I realize that most of my posts in the last few weeks have been complete and utter shit, 'tis the effect of time away from school.  I will take this time off to recharge, read a few books and try to recapture the gold that made me so beloved at the beginning of my time on the blog.  Possibly repackeged with a new gimmick (cooplander is dead and gone.. for now) new formats, anything.  I feel lost at this point, looking for success but it continues to elude me.  With the return of two of our most beloved bloggers I will leave you in their hands.  I trust that they will not dissapoint me.    Goodbye

      Cooper, it seems that the overwhelming majority feels that you should be suspended. I have thought it over and have decided that I cannot morally take you off the blog without forewarning. So consider yourself on probation, if the Cooper gold that we have fallen in love with in the past. Sorry guys but what would have JJ done in my place, even with Luca "I'm on the Woodbridge Racing Team so give me posting privlages" Corentte had ample warning. So Cooper, if the gold doesn't return you will be suspended till JJ gets back. But don't worry everyone still loves you, we just need to do some housekeeping, know what I'm sayin?  In other news, it is good to see John "King Kong ain't got nuttin on me (anymore)" Spence aka J.Sp, and bishy back blogging. It wasn't the same without you guys.  Now without further adeui,   The Babe of the Week  .............  Now this week's lucky winner may come as a complete and utter shock to you but I am sure that you will agree. She has graced the everything from Saved by the Bell, to her Oscar caliber performance in The Ladies Man.   Tiffany Amber Theissen   I must say that she had some what fallen by the way side, but she came back in full force by landing a role in Fastlane. I'm sorry but Fastlane has something that Clone High and Undergrads lack entirely, car chases and women in revealing outfits. But the thing that made Ms. Theissen truly blog material was her makeout scene with Jamie Pressely, in one of the episodes, very nice, and I think that when you see it you'll agree.   "Sometimes when I'm listening to music, I nod my head like this as if I'm saying 'Yes! Yes! Yes! To every beat.' And sometimes I shake my head like I'm saying 'No, No, No! Don't stop rocking!'

      Wow. I didn't think I had been away for that long but there is even a new format when you post, complete with cool blue swirly deals. I love it. I have had a brilliant week off of work; sleeping in, doing nothing and trying to go out at night. The only thing is that most people are tired from work and don't want to go out. Boring drones.  I'm sorry Coops, but I have to agree with Spence. I would rather read some of the old gold than waste precious minutes and even hours of my life reading your epic drivel. Don't come back on here and say: "If you don't like it, don't read it." Except yours would be filled with hundreds of grammatical, punctuation and spelling errors. I have to read whatever goes on Horkypoo. It is a way of life. So Bateman, suspend our golden boy until he can prove that he can get his act together.  So, has anyone sent h-kins anything at camp yet? Bateman should re-post the adress on here so we can get on that. Even though I most likely won't. Spence- congrats on your official removal from conduct probation. Now you are free to frolic in your creative yet shit-disturbing land of half-chubia. Word up.  --bish

      Hellllllloooooooo NURSE!  I'm sorry, I've been working at Mooredale Day Camp for the past week and it would seem appropriate to begin the post with an endearing quote from one of my beloved childhood shows,  Animaniacs .  Oh, Yakko, Wakko and Dot...  Anyways, I haven't been checking Flounder regularly, let alone posting, and I must say, that the quality has deteriorated substantially.  I am not going to detail the bscene amount of staggeringly stupid content that has manifested itself on this once affluent site.  I only motion that Adam Cooper's posting rights be suspended indefinately.  I would rather have a complete drought of posts than constant torrents of Cooper's 1 300-word idiocy.     On to more pleasant matters, not an hour ago I recieved a signed letter from Colin Lowndes declaring my removal from conduct probation.  Reportcardwise, I managed a 35 thanks to somehow winging a 72 on the French exam and hauling my mark up to a respectable 5-.  Damn Hoody and his prissy theatre exam, I got an 89 but the 7 eluded me...  Also, I'm laughing at all those mega-keeners who devote ungodly time and resources to the study and practive of HL History.  I gotta tell ya, not once did I ever copy down that stupid Course Code, Date, Class # Bullshit, I think I may have done my homework once or twice, and only when I knew he would be checking, and only after I got bishy fishy to agree to do half.   To top it all off, I decided it would be more beneficial to, rather than study, engage in youthful debauchery on the eve of my exam.  And somehow, SOMEHOW, I snagged an 87 on the exam and a 6+ on the year.  However, I hate all you HL English guys who are in any class but Dr. Churchward's and got a 7, but not as much as I rue the 3 non-English students who won English prizes.  Remember me?  I won the Ponton prize this one time....  But now I gotta take the doggy for a walk.  Peace

      OK I get it the raps sucked, i was drunk and i can't good write (look bad grammer).  From now on I'll leave the rapping to JJ and our favourite TeddyG.  By the way Bates, I drank the Bacardi Silver because it was there and I wanted to get drunk quick and beer is just to watered down.  It wasn't even mine it was my parents so I don't care.  Not my money.  The only reason I rapped was because this site is getting stale as fucking hell.  Just look.  All Bateman does is show the feedback, I'm giving you shitty raps and no one else even posts.  How shit is that?  I know that our audience is down to 2 to 5 people at best.  When I'm writing this I'm talking to Bateman and 3 other people because no one reads this shit anymore.  I could rip up Huddy or Bishop and they wouldn't know it (I won't because those guys get much pleutonic love from me) I'm just saying if our bloggers can't even post why should anyone else even read this shit?  I gotta go because I have to be up in 5 hours for work (god damnit).  I just hope this rant will inspire someone to post again.  And cowie mail in a creative post.  I know that you are smarter than most of the people on the blog, wake it out of its sleep.  Lates    sleepy time

      Cooper, fuck off about Tompkins. That is all. (I'll let the feedback do the talking)    Reiterating what Cooper said, wrote....  Coops, stop rapping, it's not worth my effort to read so it must be a waste of time for you to write.  Well he already said that it was kind of hack.   Obvious says.....  yo Cooper, that last rap was terrible man, you need to lay off the pcp and smoke some good stuff.  Well all I want to know is, why you were drinking Bacardi Silver man, what happened to our adventures in beer bonging? Don't let those stupid ads on Q107 and Edge 102 fool you man, it is still a chick drink. Come on lets have some common sense here, ok Cooper? Because friends, don't let friends drink coolers.    Someone commenting on the Shittiness of Cooper's rap, said....  It was shitty  Yes, Yes it was. Now let us never speak of the shitty rap again.   Cooper, shut up about Tomkins this and Tompkins that, the comments he gave me were bullshit, he said some pretty harsh things, lets leave it at that. Btw, your next wrap should be about beers man, you need to get back on the winning team. And your story was jokes man, keep it up, 120 is definetly the way to go.   Well as for myself, I have had a pretty hectic week. Tuesday was not only Canada Day, but also my birthday, so yeah had some good times, and last night was even better just was everywhere, man I need Karim to get his shit together, eventhough he is a good guy.  Well thats it for now I am away this weekend but'll be back ASAP doing another post.

      Hello all and wat's crackin'  I'm just chillin in bed with my lapytopy getting in my late night fix, I cannot sleep without this blog.  Actually it's because I'm a little drunky because I drank some Bacardi silvery,  6 bottles to exacty, 20 minutes I did drinky.  I cannot say that I am sober, but I'm concious so that's a plusy, I should really learn how to rhymy.  Last night was jokes, I went to this party at my friends house, then we headed out to pick up a "picker upper" what I didn't know until later was that this "picker upper" had a substance in it that I did not expect to find.  A little p hanging with the c and chillin with the p.  I wanted to beat the shit out of my friend when he told me this, becuause I wanted to stick to what I know, but I survived and I am hear to tell you all that you should stick to what you know, for the rest is quite the trip, forcheeesi.  This isn't the first time that he has done dis pour mon ami has put some of the main character of blow in a 'ting before.  Maybe I should inspect this shit first, but if I've never had it before I'd have no idea how to identify it.  I should meet up with GC and his boys, then I now wat I hittin'.    Anyways, I hit my little cousins' house for a little Canada Day jam, chilled with my relatives and man do my little cousins like water guns!  They be chasing me around with these guns and I be doing Tarzan on the trees (swinging around the trees to do a quick 180 and trip them up.  Remember they like 6 and 7 and such so this be a major trip out for them at first.  I actually burnt myself on one of those sparklers.  I was trying to bend one about 5 minutes after it was finished and my wrist caught a hot part and my wrist got all burnt up, no pain just like discomfort, pain is for wussy babies, LOVE THE PAIN!!! jks.    Fucknig was arguing with my parents on the highway about the right speed on the super speedy QEW, they felt that 110 was a safe speed to not get caught, I thought 120 was the best speed, this led to fighting the entire way home.  I wanted to smack them, becuase the cops are almost never on the highway and when they are they are looking for people going over 140, not the 120 people, fuck 'em.  And they don't like POD either, waht the fucks up with them.  At least my mom and sister are going to PEI for hockey for 2 weeks.  Too bad my dad isn't going with them.  At least I can party at home when my dad is at work during the day and when I'm not at work.  Studies boys make a logic statement for that!!!  JKS!  Griff rules... maybe.  Cool guy, but he expects us to work as hard as his gifted fucking higher math guys, why do you think we're in studies?  We're lazy and not as gifted as the higher guys.  If we went to studies then we were content with where we were in math, otherwise we would stay in methods and work our asses off.  Has to be said.  If 4 guys in a class of 16 or something do their homework you shouldn't get mad just accpet it.  We're lazy.  We might wake up about our schooling, but that may not happen till University.  In case Griffen reads this: I do think you are one of the better teachers in the school and you deserve your position as head of math, but 5 minutes of homework is the same as 20 minutes, it still requires us to open our books.  Don't worry Griff, much love goes out to you for your help  this year, happy you're my teacher next year.  Man that was a weird rant.  By the way Jane's Addiction still rules.  Just Because is f-ing amazing!!  I think the disck comes out July 20th or something.  Ruled in the early 90's and they still rule now, that vocalist is amazing. Sounds nostalgic and new at the same time... crazy.  I'm picking up that disk, only other cd's I've bought over the last 2 years were both Linkin Park.  This will be the first non LP in a few years, can't wait for faint.  Time to hit the raps.  I'll get through as many as I can.  Should have done these while I was still drunk, now I'm just buzzed, well we'll see how it goes, probably still suck, well here it goes. starting with... hmm... who was in our class... hmm... BOUCHER!!!  The Class by the John, Part 2  There's Boucher the fast skater, hockey player His dad was a speed skater He's french too Sounds like someones going to the loo Can Boucher score? Man he scores like Jasmine St. Claire  Oliver Reid the famous actor We get Doug Reid the philosipher His dad had a hamster He fried it like a hamburger Convulsing like a crack head They sent him flying with a pack He hit the ground with a smack  Who's next? It's Sang Ik Song, everybody retch! He's as exciting as Doc T I'd rather see Booker T This boy can put anyone to sleep He plays ping pong fo reel He's p pong champ everyone yeaallll  Who loves Tompkins? Everybody's best buddy Huddy!! The ladies say he's a good lay That's what they say We should ask Mrs. Tompykins She knows his outs and ins He's buds with Hioorrkins  Its the toight master himself Bish the fish He watch the movies good!! He's buds with Hood! Don't call him a sketchball He loves the cap du squashball!!  Coop loves his tanning  Almost like screwing He don't use vagiclean But he knows how to preen Running with the model crowd He knows how to dress loud Don't challenge him to a walk off That's like trying to out mack him Don't even try just fuck off!  Who is that genius? Its the prophet!! Its the prophet!! Don't diss Frost This man will make you feel lost Like Bishop and his phallic imagery Man that is just a tent, no imagery bishy! He may doze But he'll never lose Everyone loves No report card could stop Love the Tompkins Praise the prophet!!  Well that's it.  Not great but man Tompkins is king, Bateman I can't believe that the report card pissed you off.  So what!  The 9 months in his class were worth it.  Would you rather have Matthews?  Cowie?  Hood?  Churchword?  Tompkins is a great guy.  If he gave you a crappy comment you probably deserved it.  Never bash Tompkins man.  You're right most people on the blog do love WT. So you can make like a tree and... you know what I mean.  He's a great guy, don't diss him.  Even after schools out, just be happy you're out.  My want my next rap/poem to be decided by you guys, let me know who or what you want me to rap about!  Use the feedback!!  You know I love providing you with entertainment.  Give me a good topic and I will provide you with an amazing rap/poem, I still don't know what that last one was, I should try it to a beat see if it works.  Let's make Horkins proud when he comes back, we are only holding up the fort while he is gone.  No one can replace the flounder and we will not even try.  Just to let you guys know, I am a 29 and I am proud of it.  My theater dropped from a 6- to a 5- and my French went from a 3+ to a 4-.  I can't win.  Payce y'all this blog took 1 hour so enjoy it boys and gals, I love you all and boozing and blogging rules!!!!!

      To quote Johnathan Spence...  "I'm baaaaaaack"  For the first time since June 15th, I am back in the T-Dot. My summer was a great time, with celebrity sightings at the workplace including TSN's Gino Reda, the guy from sportsnet with tourettes, and my personal highlight, Adam Cooper and his daddy. I also had the pleasure of cleaning the clubs of various other upstanding young men such as Alex Bishop, David Peppal, and Alex Tapscott - the king of the 200 yard lob wedge. Anyway's, good to be back and see y'all at school.

      A bit of a follow-up to the last feedback:   some random "chick" (sorry...), aka gossipgirl writes...  "actually, im a random chick not a guy, and i'd tell you who i was, but i'd get killed.  but i can assure you, bateman and kristen got it on...  do i need to provide a play by play?  you know you love me, gossipgirl"  Well gossipgirl, seeing as you won't reveal your true identity to me and the world I really don't know if I "love you" or not. And right now all I have to go by is these rumors you're spreading about my good friend Ian here (the  master-bater ?) now Ian is a good guy you don't need to spread shit about him. Regardless of whether it's true or not I'm sure he doesn't appreciate it that you're abusing the anonymity of the FOL feedback system to tell the world of his supposed exploits (I'm publishing you out of sheer courtesy for the small yet intense fanbase this site enjoys). Until I know you're trustworthy, or until IB himself confirms or denies this I'd advise everyone to take gossipgirl's gossip with a grain of salt.  Just to abuse my admin privaleges if I may Chris. As I recall, my level of awesomeness was shocking, and apparently (as my memory this summer has been rather weak) there was some touching and that was about it. So this got it on bullshit, is exactly that, cowpoo (no offense Cowie). Anyway FYI Grey Goose Bodka is lethal. So Monica Tam and Jess Chan, I mean whoops you didn't want your names mentioned did you, my bad.  Next thing, I'd like to apologise to JT$ for my mean-ness in answering his email cause actually the  urlLink Terry Tate site  is really funny. You should all check it out, or I'll put the hurt on you baby, Whooo!  Third and final thing. Driving School is hella-boring. I am constantly amazed (amazed in a very dull way) how they can fill a whole day of material without so much as showing us a real car not in some video (which are all ford commercials). It's made more boring cause I don't really know anyone there, well I do sort of know some people (Hudson's girlfriend is in the same class as Luca would say "girlfriend of Pedro, and some random IB1's that I don't know that well). ANd it's only half over, which makes me want real school to start so much more...  And I'm spent. (hopefully someone else will post besides me? Guys?)

      What do ya know... feedback. Here we go:   marc oliver writes:  "hey horkins its ollie, went to school and camp with u, dude its going international, somebody told me bout the website, anyways man its cool out here in south africa,  peace out bro marc oliver"  It's nice to see that you still care... And there was a PS but I cut it out. The blog's reach has extended past Canada, next thing you know we'll be bought by Yahoo!... that would suck.   Jeffrey Taylor writes:  "Thought you guys mihgt like the site... www.terrtate.reebock.com"  Once again Jeffrey, your lack of spelling correctness astounds me. I think the adress should be  urlLink www.terrytate.reebok.com .   And that's all the news fit to be printed. I'll see you next week.

Hopefully my marks are good enough this year. I got the chance to play some great golf at Le Diable and Le Geant over at Tremblant. And Mike Weir is doing pretty well in the PGA right now so I'm gonna go watch it.  peace

      Okay this feedback from my good friend with a phallic themed name sums up my feelings exactly:  "What the fuck! Your site is dead. No one posts. I am greatly concerned as I have become chemicaly dependant on the dry wittisms that once frequented your site. I fear that if they do not return I will be forced to turn to tobacco or even alchol to fill the void.   Of course, you could always jazz things up by reintroducing a former blogger (myself).   Horkins, soon it will be too late,  The circumcised Dick  P.S. please excuse any spelling errors"  William, I hear you brutha. I haven't been posting lately because I don't have a whole lot to post about. And no one else (except maybe the occasional Cooplander post which just haven't been the same lately, since he ended the story and the quotes...) posts at all. Any and all spelling errors and profanity is excused as you are right to point out the "deadness" of Flounder Online. In this rainy summer, we are experiencing a drought. But don't call the preacher yet, it ain't over. Peeps is just too caught up in the whole summer-ness of it all to bother to stop by and tag this ol' brick wall. And if you feel it necessary, jazz away my friend. If you go to Blogger.com and log in to your old account you'll find I never actually cut you, just said I did and went home. So let's not let the laid backness of the summer, or as I call it: "SunnyTime", stop us from layin back a spell and posting at our favourite blog: Flounder Online.  PS- Turn to??? Let the good times and dry witticisms roll.

      I HATE ADS!!!!!!!!  Every time I check the site I get bombarded by ad after ad after ad... for every ad I close another opens!  There used to be just 3 ads.  Now it takes me 5 minutes to close all the ads.  There I'm finished on that.  Sorry for not posting for a while.  Life has been kinda hectic.  Went up to Guelph the other day to meet some friends I hadn't seen in a while and I found the funniest spot in all of Guelph.  White Trash Corner!!  At the corner of Benton and King in Guelph there is constantly at least 10 people on this corner just hanging out.  Not just regular people, but hicks, you could take a picture of any of them and put it beside the definition of hick in the dictionary.  I'm talking wife beaters, all forms of facial hair, drinking booze from paper bags and skanky bitches.  I sat across the seat and watched their antics for around 1/2 hour.  During that time: 4 fights broke out, 3 drunks stumbled around, 2 arguments between two different white trash couples (of which the content was extrememly entertaining) and 1 passed out hick.  All within half an hour.  I passed by the place in my car 2 more times that day and there were always different people but always the same type of hicks.  I could have just sat there watching them all day.  Funny thing is I don't think any of them were homeless.  I'm pissed that I missed SARSTOCK.  Looked like a lot of fun.  TV coverage blew ass.  Most of it was just stupid video segments.  I got bored and turned it off.  AC DC sounded awesome though.  My friends who were there said they stole the show (sorry "JUSTIN").  Just over 3 weeks till school starts back up "AHHHHHHHH!!!!!" Lates

      Let me say this: The stones concert was freakin awesome. All the bands (okay not ALL the bands... justin, the flaming lips, that french band) were great especially AC/DC, the Stones, and the Guess Who. Rush had washing machines on stage or some crap like that. They're weird. And Ian and George, if your out there I'm sorry Will and me never found you but we went all the way to the place you were gonna meet us at and you werent there but our good friend Daniel "WildCArd! YEAH!" Bernhard was as well as Will's cousin who is in the band (but isnt the one named Alvin) and we tried to calll you like ten times and yelled your name between songs, ("IAN BATEMAN!!!!.... is gay") people gave us looks man. But anyways it was still a great concert. We even met a nice dude from Hamilton who was quite impressed by Will's "JPS" and his friend who we didnt like as much. And that dude who kept yellin "YEAH JUSTIN!" But I can see I'm ramblin herre so, I'll jus leave it. PEACE

      I'm kinda low on ideas so I'm just gonna put up some feedback about Cooper's retardedly awesome story:   some guy writes:  "Cooper, You're a fucking idiot for letting your friend drive you home when you're  both fucking wasted. fucked up man"  Yeah, Cooper, this guy is kinda right, but your story was definitely worth all the stupid shit you did just to tell it to us all.   probably a girl writes:  "The BSS trio should post more often: Katie, WInks, Sarah...c'mon now, y'all  doing it for a good cause *drools* ;) "  YES! I couldn't agree more with this most definitely female fan of the blog. Katie, I've seen you at way too many parties for you not to be posting all the time like it's no one's business. And it's not like your busy with Milan, cause he apparently doesn't exist... Anyways I couldn't figure out what the "good cause" is, but I figure it's got something to do with letting us incredibly lame dudes feel like girls are actually paying attention to us... YEAH! Keep it up.    Farouk writes:  "hey horkins im disappointed that first ur raggin on the brown, the coolest colour not in  the rainbow, and second that u think i would post somethin so incoherent talkin  about "indiana jones" or chicks who are actually dudes and would ever think,  let alone say, the word "shiat" in public..you know my word is 'wiow' not cool man, i think the rides home are over (probably to your benefit cuz ull  get home alive) but u wont get to kick it with my tunes anymore  payce farouk"  F-dog, FA-rule, man I was just playin when I said that, y'all know I'm down with the brown. You already have given me a ride home since writing this so I know that was a big lie, and we were kickin to my own fly beats which you know you love. And btw, it was Ed Kim who wrote the "shiat" letter.

      Now if anyone had a night or a story that comes anywhere close to the wierdness of this night I'd like to hear about it.   The Night The Lights Went Out   This story starts on August 14th 2003; its around 4 oclock.  Im at Royal Woodbine golf course fulfilling my shift of 2  close.  At 4:12 pm on that day the power went out!  At 5 oclock it was still out.  I was getting annoyed because I was hungry and I wanted food.  At 6 oclock the power was still out.  This was beginning to cause problems as I had to park carts.  The problem is that the carts have to be parked underground.  This means that I have to try and park these carts in the dark.  Most golf courses are very cheap and Royal Woodbine is no exception.  There were no flashlights anywhere on the course.  So I was forced to try and park using the light of a disposable camera.  As you can tell this proved difficult as a camera can be only so useful as a flashlight.  During the parking I was able to crash numerous times and caused some damage to the carts (obviously I hid these carts in the back).  By 7 oclock everyone has      realized that the lights were going to be out for at least the night.   My co-workers and I had been able to acquire 8 cans of Alexander Keiths finest brew to last us through the night.  I had an inkling that this would not be an adequate enough amount of alcohol.  So I devised a plan, which you will learn of later.  By 8 oclock the sun was beginning to set.  I already called my parents and let them know that I would be coming home late and that I would be getting a ride home.  This was the first step of my plan.  At about 8:30 the snack girl came in off the course.  I decided that in order to get what I wanted Id have to involve myself in some trickery.  I helped her park her cart since she was parking in the dark.  I then helped her unload all the garbage and leftover food and booze back into the food room.  After I was done I asked her if I could help myself to a drink and a bag of chips, she agreed to this.  So she gave me the keys to the room and I helped myself to a hieny and a bag of chips.  At this point I offered to lock the room for her, since she was done.  She once again agreed.  I closed the door, took out the keys, but I did not lock the door.  I simply acted like I did.  At 9 oclock the last staff cart came in, which happened to have headlights on it.  At 9:30 all the carts were parked and the night was over or so it seemed.   I told my compadres of my plan.  You see since the restaurant upstairs could not make food they closed up at 8.  And due to the power outage, the security cameras did not work and then I told them about the food storage room trick.  So there were no security cameras, no one left but us, and an unlimitless supply of booze and food.  We quickly went to work on the beers we had taken earlier.  By 10 we had finished these and had each had about 3 beers each.  Not much yet.  We then headed into the storage room and stumbled around for around 5 minutes due to the lack of lights looking for the perfect alcoholic beverage.  We ended up coming out with two 12 oz. Bottles of vodka and some orange juice.  We mixed these two drinks together had many shots and by 10:30 I was mildly wasted off my ass.  By now we were thinking of ways to have fun.   Suddenly all eyes turned to the cart with headlights.  All three of us jumped on this cart as quickly as three drunken 17  20 year olds can.  With me at the wheel I knew something exciting was going to occur, I just didnt know what it was going to be yet.  I was able to make the first turn out towards the golf course.  I couldnt actually tell how fast I was going or where I was going.  I thought I was on the path but I guess I was wrong because before I knew it I was slamming on the brakes attempting to keep my cart from careening into the river in the middle of the first fairway. Our cart stopped within inches of the first rocks guarding the river.  This aint no sissy river.  We would have lost that fn cart.  It would have floated over to Lake Pollution, sorry, Ontario. Now must people would have realized at this point that they were a little wasted.  But as you all know I am not most people.  So we continued on our little journey.  We almost crashed another 5 times.  Each time within inches of the certain demise of our jobs.  We got back at around 11:15 (I just realized what an amazing itinerary this is for a guy that was wasted off his ass).  We were walking back to my buddys car when he had an idea.    You know how they drive hole in one cars out on the course once in a while?  Why dont we drive MY car onto the course!!!  We quickly agreed to this obviously retarded idea.  So we all piled into his Maxima.  I wasnt who I was more afraid of having behind the wheel, Dan or myself.  Within 30 seconds of this trip Dan almost drove his car into the pond beside the 18th green.  We then made our way up the 18th fairway heading into the course, when we stopped by the 17th green and decided to do some putting in the dark.  While they were putting I decided that I wanted to drive.  So I opened the door, the keys were still in and I turned the ignition.  Immediately, I have one of my usual moronic ideas and I decide that I am going to lock my friends out and drive backwards back up the 18th fairway.  Well my friends gave chase and I slowed down for them to catch up.  Dan grabbed onto the drivers side and Mark grabbed onto the passenger side doors, but I did not open the doors.  I simply gave them the chance to grab onto something before I sped up and dragged them back towards the clubhouse.  Take a second to imagine this scene, two people holding on for dear life to a car driving backwards up a fairway on a golf course.   I was actually able to successfully drive back into the parking lot with the car unscathed.  When I stopped the car my friends were laughing hysterically.  Partly because they survived and partly because that was some pretty fucked up shit.  I unlocked the door and Dan drove us all home to enjoy the rest of our night without power.                                  THE END   OK, Bateman now that is a summer story, and I didn't even need rednecks.   And I've been wondering Bateman, what kind of flow do u have?  "Oh no! Not me! We never lost control."

      This isn't my summer story, I'll do that later but I just wanted to post and make sure that this site wasn't dead cause I got another "Are you dead?" feedback. And I was tired of seeing Bateman's stoopid story at the top. So anyways here's some feedback I got lately.   Ben Brill writes...  "uhh, horkins does anyone actually read this? I hope so cause there a quite a  few hours of work here.  add me to MSN if you've got it"  Actually yeah. Anyone does actually read this. In fact you proved yourself that you, being anyone actually read this. And I'll add you fa'reaaal.   The Ian Bateman FAn Club writes...  "Bateman's story fucking sucked. That was the worst fucking story"  No. You're the worst story... shut up wang chung.   bored with nothing better to do writes...  "Wow -- an enitre week with no posts, during the school year to boot! Is FOL a  thing of the past? Please tell me that at least one of your 'cult' members  still participates in this once-enlightened project! Please tell me that  Flounder isnt dead!"  You sound like a girl... are you a girl? If so, tell brooker's old girlfriend to post again. That was hot. And I'm not dead.   probably farouk writes...  "Yea, so i was checking your website out and it seemed pretty slick. Mainly  about random school shiat and stuff ya know. However, I think there should be  more of a weekend adventure story, kinda like indiana jones ya know?(Real  life) Rolling a couch down yonge - eglington tied to a back of an odyssey van ,  Going to a bar and realizing after a while that there are no chicks in there (  gay bar), Hitting on a hot blonde chick until you hear her speak and find out  she's a dude, shiat like that.  You need some crazy shiat up here and if you want I'm willing to write my  weekend adventures from the past and present for ya. It's pretty crazy mind  you.  My name will remain to be a mystery until eventually someone figures it out  I guess."  THis sounds like Farouk. He's saying weird shit trying to be ghetto. "Shiat"??? Said that one like... thrice. And while that sounds like quite an adventure, I just don't know if it's FOL material. Sorry Farouk. And if your not Farouk, stop being like farouk, its bad for you. And he's brown what up with that?  til next time  P34[3 (peace)

      Ok Bishop, I know that I am going to get ridiculed for this, but I am going to enter the story contest, it probably sucks but here goes...  I'm at a buddies place for the weekend in early July. We're chilling in his pool house when the CD we're listening to stops, but there still is this loud music in the background. We stop and listen to it for a bit, and finally recognize it for some sort of jam. Now, previous encounters with local parties has been pretty good, laid back and just generally a pretty good time. So we keep following the sound, it looks like it is coming from a neighbouring lot so we take some nature path till we find the origin of the sound. We keep walking on and come to the back of what looks like a small house, with lights ablaze and music blaring. However, we soon realize that there are some even smaller homes down the way. By the time we are in the middle of the howdown, we realize that it is precisely that, a howdown being put on by the not so friendly trailer park locals. Our time of realization came at a fairly in opportune time, as many people had stopped dancing and had turned their attention to the city boys that had just shown up. One gentleman even went as far to ask me where the Williams F1 trucking company was from (I think he was pretty serious). Another thing, all of them were white and the large majority of them were wearing wife beaters and had mullets, and the women looked as if they could drink McKell under the table to say the least (not to mention that they could kick the shit out of him). They did follow one fashion trend however, mesh hats. When we were asked to request a song I just said that I had to go to the washroom and we ran off pretty quickly.  Anyway Bishop it may not sound too funny, but its true, and you now have your first story to grade. So I took one for the team so don't put me under too much ridicule, I endure enough everyday.  - The day Bateman loses the flow, is the day the hair on Brad Adam's bald head grow!

      Holla in da hizzal!  After having at least one class with each of my teachers I think it is time to give a little overview of what I think of them (keeping it clean of course, I know we have faculty fans)  Shep - This class was a breath of fresh air after last year with the T where a good class would add up to me staying awake for 1/2 an hour, now history is as refreshing as a facial.  The man of a million faces is definetly going to make this a good year of history.  Lowndes - Another uber chillin' teacher.  Theatre looks like a good year with Lowndes at the helm, don't know much about him yet but he seems chillin'.  Briglio - Only one class so far and I fell asleep in it, but we have yet to hear his spectacular jokes and take on the world, such as "Remember guys, if you are in an airport with a friend named John, you can't say, "Hi Jack," even as a joke.  You must say Hello, John. Otherwise the police will arrest you. It's a very serious matter."  So true  Chuchward - I'm not sure how anyone can live up WT but I know that DC is one smart fellow, and who wouldn't want to read about the Horny Man!  Sorry, sorry, I meant Horned Man  Griff - I had him for a year and he only gives 5 minutes of homework a night, so that's cool.  He reads this site so I got something to say "I did my homework for once!" I was able to open a newspaper, skip PAST the Fashion section, get to business and cut out the exchange rate stuff fo' math class.  What skill and determination!!  Turner - I have no clue but I fell asleep in one class and I was wide awake for the next.  Therefore I am 50 50 on him so far.  I am going to take my time with this summer story contest.  I know that I will be merely a side-show to Spence's Main Event, but I am sure I will fit well into the midcard just like Lance Storm (wrestling fans will get that one).  You know Cooplander himself the premier male model must have some exciting stories to tell.  I guess we'll just have to find out.  "I love watching as the snow makes brushes out of trees" Jane's Addiction - The Riches  What can I say? The new Jane's stuff is focheesi chillin' and that's better than uber good  Remember the Rundown comes out September 26th featuring The Rock, Sean William Scott and Christopher Walken

      Giddyup cowpeeps,  School is off to a booming start and I am quite content with my teachers/classes. As horkypoo said, our systems class is the most rediculous class in the world. How could they punish Dr. Hamr with such a motley group of individuals? That class is going to be amazing. I cannot stress it enough. My other classes are pretty intense too. Shep had me in stitches in both History and TOK. He should join the blog. Procunier scared the shit out of me. No verdict yet on scowie for english. No disrespect to him, but i doubt anyone can live up to WT. Actually I  know  that for a fact. Dr. Churchward seems pretty money. He is undoubtedly very intelligent and a theatre guru. I'm just worried about the tough marking which could be a bitch. I don't know why but I found Mme. Lowndes quite entertaining and amusing. I don't think I will mind that class at all. I would though love to have Keith "Niles Crane" Fleming fo sho.  Johnny should definately get back on here and tell us all about his "sexcapades" (probaly not at all like icecapades but you never know). All I know is that she can roll on a banana flavoured jimmy hat with her mouth. There are way too many stories to be told from the summer. Thus I propose a new contest:  The Summer Story Contest!  I want to hear about your most interesting, funny, sad, scary, or whatever the fuck else kind of experieces you little twerps had over the summer. The rating system will be divided into three catagories, each out of 10 banana flavoured condoms (scoring denomination is subject to change):  1) Pure entertainment value 2) Writing prowess 3) The "No-bullshit factor"  If you want your story to remain anonymous, use the feedback system you pussy. Anyhow, gimme your goods from the summer and make it good or else you will be subject to the kind of ridicule that bateman endures every day of his life jkjk.  --bishy

      Wassup homedawgs,  School is in full swing with the first full day of classes being today. After one day, Evan "I am named after a whisky" Williams's TOK class is a kajillion bazillion times better than Crawford's. We had some insaaane debate goin on over some ill moral dilemmas. Studies is everything it was last year and more. My man G-Prime aka Studmaster Coach G aka THe best teacher ever (and that means EVER) GRiffin is still illin and chillin in good ol room 3-0-Studies. We have several new mover acrossers from (crystal) Methods who are as happy to learn as I about 2 months off math in January (even more spares? Holla at ya boy!) After a little chillin at lunch with the boys, I had some Geo which is still fly (kinda like the BigTymers) and then the greatest class ever: Systems with Dr. Hamr. I never thought a class could get better than Premek "the license plate on my Aerio says Crayfish" Hamr's Systems class but now in a pimptight new location and with an even sketchier to the m@xxx class population, this class has become umptillion times better.  Cooper you are back and that last post was as good as the old Cooplander gold! Keep it up buddy.  And MR. G, I know you're reading this: You are a great teacher. Not that I'm sucking up but a seven in studies really would make my year. And I would consider giving you money.  And now that I've killed off my spare. I'm out. PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYCe

      Wassupp my home dogs!  Cooplander is back to entertain and confuse.  Had a chillin' summer with much good times and fortunately few bad times (besides backing into another car. ooopppps!!)  But my summer is not what this post is about, 'cause school is back!!  Time to see who has changed and who's new.  Anyone check Frechette's new doo?  It just kills his modeling potential, the shag is where its at.  Steinbach is back.  Has a new eyebrow ring and I don't think he's cut his hair in a while, but its all good, I think the sketchy look is going to make a comeback.  Ditz has the carazzziast new tattoo, and it aint no little butterfly this is a giant I'm a tough guy tattoo. I gotta give props to ditz for going through on something like that.  Otherwise I haven't seen too much new stuff.  I'll give you all the rundown (coincidently the Rock's new movie with Seann William Scott is also called the Rundown) on all my teachers tomorrow.  I give love to the Griff because he does the schedules and I get to sleep in tomorrow.  SCHWWIIIIINGGGGG!!!  I'll catch anyone I haven't seen over the last few days tomorrow, you know i love ya (pleutonic)  "Man of peace.  Man of War.  Tell me who know's more?"

      'cho guyyyy...  The first "day" of school was pretty chilllz. Aside from only being half a day, I also have some pretty sick teachers. The C-L dog is not only the coolest dude in the administration but also a chiller-supreme of a Theatre teacher. WT is still WT... what a chiller And this new class may not be quite as good as last years WT english but we just have to gel I guess. Briglio is twice the briglio he was in grade 9, if i did not have the Flem-dawg this year (which I don't) then this guy is my man. A true chiller. And although at first I was bent that I wouldn't have Hoel cause he left and then Barter stopped teachin IB2 and then I didn't get the Mensilator (the slimmest lookin dude right now), but Turner is a mad chiller. He was reading all sorts of crazy stuff at us today from these chill books. All Geo teachers are chillers, it's in the code or something. I dont know about this new Toope guy, but if anyone has him if they could allude to whether he is as chillin as the other Geo teachers?  And those are my great teachers. gLace's birthday is comin up so... happy birthday buddy, you truly are one bad mutha... shut your mouth. And if anyone disagrees, I hate them, cause they're in on this too...  I'm out. I Holla!

      Today was the first day of IB2. Got to see all the homeys, peeps and thugs back at UCC. Estey has a car and a G2 now... he is now the friend with wheels. Cow-dog has had some "fun times" over the summer it seems. And so it seems has everyone else... making mine look rather dry in comparison. Well we just gotta make it a killer fall/winter/spring yo! Me and mCow went golfin at the 'dale today, and it looked as if we would have to take transit (gasp) until a fine upstanding young man with a car stepped in. Which brings me to the newest feature of the blog.   Baller of the Week  Not only is Ali Kanji the commmunity service steward, he also gave me and cowie a ride to the golf course when his own mother denied us one. What a great guy. And not only that, he's the baller of the week. And Baller status is to be highly sought after as it officially makes you the chillinest ballinest farealest dude in most rooms you might find yourself in. yeah!  I'll be back wit more later laates.

      "Hellllooooooooooooo!!!" I love seinfeld, great show.  Anyways welcome to another edition of Cooper's Corner.  Anyways, I'd like to apologize for posting the story about ed.  I know some people found it entertaining and funny, but this site should not be used to further grudges.  Being able to post on this site is a privilege and my post was not "honourable."  Anyways I'll try to keep the personal grudges off the site from now on.  Non-wrestling fans skip the next section.  I'd like to quickly pay tribute to two amazing men who died over the weekend.  Firstly, Stu Hart the father and trainer of Bret and Owen Hart died this weekend of pneumonia.  He was a great man respected by everyone in the industry.  He trained people such as his sons, Chris Jericho, Davey Boy Smith, Dynamite Kid, and Chris Benoit, as well as countless others.  His effect on the industry will be forever felt.  He was 82. I'd also like to pay tribute to the memory of Road Warrior member Hawk.  Also known as the Legion of Doom, Animal and Hawk formed what is now known as the greatest tag team in history.  He worked in the WWF in the late 80's and the early 90's.  Their tag team was so popular and their gimmick so unique Vince McMahon copied the gimmick before they came to the WWF.  Road Warrior Hawk aka Michael Hegstrand died in his sleep on Sunday.  He was 45.  Its a tragedy when someone so young is taken from this earth.  Another great man. (For more info on these two men head to www.411mania.com/wrestling.    Some cool theatre presentations, highlighted by a rare performance by Matt Cowie and Chris Horkins.  The entire IB1 theatre class watched so we had a large audience.  Made me feel hot and uncomftorable.  But I didn't fuck up my presentation so I was happy.  For those of you who came here just to read up my post on ed look down a few posts.  As well I'm working on the fight between Cowie and Bateman.  I took the WWE approach and have used JR and King as announcers.  Expect it to be finished in the next week.  Matt Cowie vs. Ian Bateman  special guest referee -  Chris Horkins  "I'm too sexy for my pants" Too Sexy - some guy  annnddddddd.... i'm out!

      Bonjour fellow bloggers and fans.  Cooplander's finally posting again!    You know what sucks?  Curfews!  I was chillin at Graham's party, and having a good time.  Lots of good stuff going on there, but just as the party was getting really good I had to leave.  I could have broken curfew but then I wouldn't have gotten the car for another few weeks.  You see the dilemma.  God damn curfew.  Almost as annoying as Horkins getting 118% on a math test!!  Damn your juicy brain!!  Now by now you all know about the events involving my sister, Ed Kim and a very cunning plan involving a blanket.  If you don't know this story then where the hell have you been living?  Under a rock?  Everyone knows about it!  Well I forced a bit of information out of my sister yesterday about Ed while she was a little under the influence.  Are you ready for this?  Ed Kim's phallus is of minute stature.  I know I shouldn't be posting this, but Ed probably shouldn't have told the entire school about last weekend either, so I guess we're even.  Onto a much lighter topic...I love the community service I'm doing!  I'm helping coach a couple of tyke hockey teams.  That means I'm teaching a bunch of kids aged 4-6 the basics of hockey.  The coolest thing is all these kids are like crazy funny.  Most of them can't stop yet so they just skate full speed into the boards and sort of bounce off.  This one kid is so funny, he just skates around with this big grin pasted to his face and doesn't listen to anyone, just sort of skates where he wants.  Total jokes.

"You have ADD, and ADHD it's hyperactive cousin" guest starring Tom Green "I see you're reading my book... book book, touch the book, lick the book... lickthebook licktheboook. I'm an albatross flap flap flapping my albatross wings" What a great show.  Cooper, you aren't an insensitive pig for thinking that girl is the most hideous thing ever to walk the earth, because she is... AAAAWGH!!!! To that girl in the picture (rachel?) I'm so so so sorry! Get some surgery or something.   Hey guess what? what. I got 118% on a math test! Ah... studies. Don't you love it? I guess this compensates for my earlier 3 out of 14. "So this test is out of 35 cause of the bell curve?" "correct" "So what's 41 1/2 out of 35?" Sorry I had to rub it in. I beat the smart kids I beat the smart kids... I bent my wookie.  The House BBQ (and the ensuing events...) was fa'reaaal. Props to Hudson and his mommy and daddy who slaved round the clock to feed our burger hungry mouths. On the way home Farouk and me drag raced some guy who thought he was so cool and tried to pull ahead of us and went right into the middle of the intersection on a red light. What a goofus!   Aight this is JJ Snuggz signing off bra  PS- "The sounds of the street. kssshshshshhhhshshhkshhh... wooooewoooowoooeooo... I'm gon shoot you PRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAT RATA TAT TAT!"  the end

      Ghetto Fabulous... jks man.  I have to comment on that picture.  God Damn!  I don't want to sound insensitive or anything but the girl on the far right of that picture has to be the ugliest of all of god's creatures.  I feel sorry for anyone that has to go through life looking like that.  Yeah its confirmed I'm an insensitive pig. OINK!  Anyways... Got the results back from this assessment I took and received some surprising news.  Cooplander, the man you all love and revere... has ADHD and a learning disability.  I kid you not.  Like the great Gandhi from Clone High I have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. "Hey look at this flabby skin on my elbow!!"  I'm going to be spending more time in the learning center for this shiaattt then, then, uhhh... ummm... A learning center teacher person!  Maybe this explains why I come off as such a dumbass.  I scored the most amazing goal ever witnessed in house soccer.  Amazing in the way that it is embarassing to the person who scored the goal and the person who let it in.  In short, I shot the ball, fell on my ass and my shitty shot flopped over the goaltender's outstreached arms... Then the ref called it offsides.  I hate soccer.  Horkins we grop and touch because you're just so damn snuggable.  Love to say more but all I can talk about is work, work and more work. Stupid IB.  I have assignments coming out of my proverbial yin-yang.

I'm addicted to Jane's Addiction. Lates

      I'm headed to our McHugh's house BBQ waiting for my ride from Farouk, who when I called was in a bit of a fit of "coughing" (aka he was hittin the chronz hard). I just had a rehearsal for my one act play written and directed by me. Bateman man, he was bein all ghetto fabulous and making everyone mad. We were all like holy crap, shut up. And then we were turning the lights off and people were jumping out and groping me and scaring me like "AAAAAAAH!" But it was all good.  I told Spence and Bishop to post more. And btw, it's a new look and I can't change it, so you better like it. The End.

      We're watching a movie in Geo... I'm supposed to be taking notes!  Anyways, Coop I kinda forgot what my big idea was... I think it was that we should have a contest for peeps to describe who would win in a streetfight: Matthew Cowie, or Ian Bateman? Please describe in depth who would win, how, and why. And maybe even where...?!!!  But in all seriousness I have to ask all of you to take a moment of silence and remembrance for Atlanta Thrashers forward Dan Snyder who died last night from injuries sustained during a horrible car crash in Dany Heatley's car. Snyder played his career as one of the least known players on one of the worst teams in the NHL, it is sad to think this drunken car accident is how he will be remembered. I wonder if Dany Heatley will be charged for manslaughter, that would be a huge controversy almost as big as the Marty McSorley trial...  Now for something hilarious to laugh at. As you all know there is a certain  urlLink ninja website  with a certain video of a kid playing with his "bowstaff". It turns out this kid is known as the "Star Wars Kid" and several remixes have been made of his little home movie. Including one of him with an actual light sabre (hilarious!) and one where he fights himself! They can all be found at  urlLink jedimaster.net  So check it out. You'll laugh all the way to the bank!  My new  urlLink flatscreen iMac  arrived and it's a sick machine. 1 Ghz, g4. YEAH!  Browns win! Whoo! Cleveland is going to the superbowl I'm tellin you right now!  That's all I got.

      Posting in TOK class right now.  Yes you are all right my story was fochizzle.  Almost as good as IMPROV!!  Go Horkins!  So snuggable right now.  Well McCabe is gone for a few weeks due to surgery on his knee.  I think this is directly related to the fact that he shaved his mohawk.  That would be like samson shaving his beautiful blond locks.  I witnessed the debut of two plays in the last two weeks  This is our Youth  and  The Play is the Thing .  This is our Youth was chronstastic!  To make a long story short this play was about two stoners a chick and their really, really fucked up lives.  Unfortunately, I forgot what an intermission was and left after the first act.  I realized my mistake while driving home on the Gardiner.  So stupid.  Woody Harrelson was the director of this play and he wast baked out of his f'n mind.  He was wearing his usual total hemp clothing, as well as a hemp fisherman's hat which he had shoved over his eyes as to hide the clues that he had consumed a large amount of illicit materials a short while earlier.  I got a look at those bloodshot eyes after the first act when he left the theater, but temporarily forgot to put his hat on.  He almost fell when he shoved that hat back onto his head.  So jokes right now.  What can I say about Diego?  He's amazing.  Its too bad he gets paid shit because The Play's The Thing was amazing.  A true knockout comedy.  Speaking of knockouts... Horkins has an amazing idea to restart the site.  It will give us the ability to write interesting stuff again.  I will let him tell you what it is because its his idea and I don't want to steal his thunder.  I'm just trying to get him to start this project up.  By the way "some guy," yes I was an idiot for letting my drunk friend drive me home but I don't know anyone who's decision making skills are very good when they are DRUNK!  C'mon man!  Obviously if I was sober I would not have gone in that car, but I was drunk and the police were too busy with the power outage then us.  "Whose car am I driving in?"

      Ok Horkins Im taking up the bloggnezzee challenge of posting, for like the second time in 6 months, but whatever... Anyway the dance was fun but I drank way too much and went driving by myself for the first time (just got the one and only G2 nomesayin?) early the next morning, not good, definetly hung over out of my mind, and definetly not a good idea. I have a pic that will destroy all others, behold making fun of spanish!     Hahaha thats a classic.  Horkins that Rolling Stone's list is fucking shocking. Arguably Sgt. Peppers deserves to be #1, but Pet Sounds (the albulm that influenced Sgt. Peppers) doesn't deserve to be #2. Top ten maybe (cause it led to so much more...) but Dark Side of the Moon definetly deserves to be in the Top 3 at least. But not fucking #43, that albulm is so mega, it is an experience to listen to it to it through its entiretity. It had such a profound impact on me that I still remember the first time I listened to it, a wave of indescribeable feelings come over you, it is just that good, it certainly deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence as Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. The thing that disgusts me most is that they rate David Bowie higher than it and the Door's debut. If you have never listened to the Doors, do it right fucking now, they are so brilliant! If you think that Tupac 'paints a picture' with his brutal honesty, then listen to  Riders On the Storm , the last song recorded by Jim Morrison and it just makes you think how good they could have been, had the press not shit on them and Jim Morrison made his subsequent trip to Paris, we all know how it ends, and if you don't then fuck off. Jim was a poet first, musician second. Don't even get me started on ranking a fucking Michael 'there's an innocence with sleeping in the same bed as little boys' Jackson's thriller. Some peeps may say that that is a good albulm, but it can't compete with The Doors and Dark Side, and MJ the 'innocence' you are refering to is illegal, stop taking the roids, all I gotta say. Im going to make a pretty bold statement Mr Griffin is going to disagree with big time, but Jim Morrison was a better lyricist than Dylan, he just had a such a way with words and music, and both of these albulms beat the fuck out of anything Bruce Springsteen ever did and ever will, yet they are ranked higher than these two pivotal albulms in the history of music. Don't even get me started about modern music, the #1 selling albulm of the decade is way off in like the 300s (Oasis' What's the Story Morning Glory), and I will not get into that cause that albulm was as big as Nirvana's Nevermind and beat the fuck out of anything done by U2 in the 90s. So Rolling Stone's list fucking sucks, and "I'll tell you kids.. I'd rather walk."   "But when it comes to do the line on top. You gotta make it happen..."

      Hizzallar! What!  Man Horkins no question man that top 500 list has way too much beatles and classic stuff.  The only stuff that even resembles current stuff are Nevermind at 17 and Radiohead's The Bends at 110. Rap was very represented too, compared to current rock... its just that rap is a new form and these guys are like having sex with the Beatles so you can't win man. I'm curious about how many Nirvana albums would be up there if Kurt didn't "kill" himself... but anything about Kurt should be handled by his second coming Davey Stienbach aka Taylor Hanson.  Man that dance was, to steal from Horkypoo, fa'real.  Man everyone was there... oh Cowie... and a good time was had by all.  Watching the drunk people dancing there was extremely entertaining... many a girl fell... and someone puked in the bathroom by the creativity center.. uggg  Reisman man u know how to throw a party... that after party was damn good... even Cooplander was a little wobbly coming out of there... thank god for taxi's... It was crazy seeing Katie Stoneman again... damn last time i saw her was in like grade 3... and by the way... KATIE POST... I WANT MORE POON SHIVERS!!  Yeah ok time for the finale.  "Oh no! I've said too much... haven't said enough..." REM - Losing My Religion  Peace out

       urlLink RollingStone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time   Once again, bateman knows more about this stuff, but lemme take a crack at it. I'm not sure I really agree with this list. While "Sergeant Pepper" is a great album, it's a little to experimental to be number one. I definitely think that a different Beatles album could have occupied that spot, like Revolver or Rubber Soul. But really the problem is that this list has too much of the Beatles. Pretty much EVERY beatles album is in the top 100 (even Meet The Beatles for christ sake). And the stones top album is at like 7, you'd expect better from the greatest rock and roll band of all time right? And 2 is like "the beach boys"...  This list has too much classic rock. I know it's great and all but the highest rap album is Public Enemy's "It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back". This album is a classic. Just looking at some of the song titles, you realize what a classic this is: "Bring Tha Noize", "Rebel Without a Pause", "Party For Your Right To Fight", "Cold Lampin With Flavor". The unstoppable duo of Chuck D and Flavor Flav bring the noise with attitude on this album. It represents the struggle of rap artists in the 80s when rap was just becoming popular. 48 is an insult to PE. But what is a greater insult is the other rap on the chart. The next highest is RUN-DMC's (arguably the greatest rap group of all time) "Raising Hell" probably their best album, at 120. And then just behind the soundtrack to Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack is Notorious BIG's "Ready To Die" which is, in my opinion, the greatest rap album ever produced, only at 133. Dr. Dre's "The Chronic" a west-side classic, isbeat out by Elton John's Greatest Hits at 137. The landmark "Straight Outta Compton" by NWA sits at 144, beat out by murderer Phil Spector's christmas album. I didn't really go past 200 but thats all the rap sub-200. Which is pathetic. Rolling Stone is too pussy and old fashioned to put rap music, the most innovative form of music in the past 100 years, higher than 48 and they stick timeless classics in joke spots up in the high 100's... this list sucks.

       urlLink Alex Tapscott: The Movie   I want to see Tupac Resurrection. Bateman, there has always been some speculation that the death of Tupac was faked. For example, 7 years after someone's death, if they faked their own death, then it's no longer illegal, Tupac died 7 years ago and now all this new Tupac shit is coming out. And the fact that Tupac was only shot in the stomach, and his manager Suge Knight who survived was shot in the head doesn't really add up. But odds are that 'Pac is half past dead like that Steven Segal movie. If he came out and was not dead people would be happy but mostly pissed off at how he played everyone into grieving for him and praising him as the "greatest rapper ever" (in my opinion, it's Biggie Smalls). My verdict, 2Pac is dead. But that new joint "Running (Dying To Live)" is hot!

      Hey lads, just posting now the first time in like 3 weeks... man that's a long time.  Kinda busy with California, copious amounts of homework and deallin with my stoopid sis (who by the way sent that feedback after I posted first about this mentioning Ed's minute candlestick).  But yeah California had some major prattage!  Other than the large amount of gay people running around...  But yeah golf was cool and I got drunk like 2 or 3 times out there with some random people I met.    Yo Wai Choi you rock the asian world!  I love the english stuff about the Ik man.  But yeah I found out a long time ago this isn't the place to criticize someone unless done in list form.  Keep rocking the tool of the year!  The plays tonight were crazy fly dope!  JJ's play was amazing...   Bateman plays the wigger very well... Wonder why?  But yeah Bishop's a pretty good straight man.  He's like... "Yo I'm all like standin here!  This is crrraaazzzy!!"  Then there was Will's psycho trippy action play.  Man Spence is just one giant joke. I love the improve line "You can't light for shit!"  The gay overtones/kiss weren't the greatest, but it did provide some key jk moments.  I think my 2 dollars (minus donation) was well spent.  Yeah Horky, you looked like u were havin fun tonite!  I guess he was the fan of the night at hockey on Friday!  Oh Horky...  And refering to the top 102 songs of the 90's... kinda my area of expertise... The only mistakes I think were the inclusion of Lenny Kravitz... uggh... stupid Hendrix copy... I missed Weezer, but they had been all but gone at that point so no one remembered them... I didn't. Although Say it Ain't So is number 8  There also seemed to be a severe lack of Metallica.  Waaaaayyy too much Our Lady Peace... very overrated in Canada.  Too much as well from Unplugged in New York, its good but its overrated as well. Blur song 2 should not be 3... good but not amazing.  Good list... I think Red Hot's came first because Teen Spirit is overplayed so everyone's sick of it.  "Just cause you feel it... Doesn't mean it's there!!" Radiohead - There There  Wanda SCHWINNGGG!!!  jks... lates boyes!

      Whoa I just realized that I haven't posted for forever....  PRAT! The lecture theatre is alive with the sounds of the street... The plays tonight were awesome, everything came together and even though Bishop and I didn't have our shit together all week.... But tonight everything went well for  Perfect Strangers  (In my humble opinion). If you aren't coming to see these plays then, PRAT! (you've been shot)  Well apparently I found out tonight that Tupac isn't dead afterall, he's in hiding and thats why he did this Tupac movie.. or at least thats what that Jenn girl in the plays says. But yeah last time I checked he was pretty dead, so I don't know what to think.  So from what I've heard last year's Tool of the Year segment is being discovered by many a new and devoted patrons who have had nothing better to do than to look over the old posts from like 9 months ago, I mean fuck back then Adam Louis still went to this school, all of us had never even seen Foolproof, and we thought that Jon Barr would never have gotten the lead in the musical. McKell hadn't had his baby yet I mean that was a long time ago, and there have been copius and copius amounts of posts since then. So for everyone who was offended by the Tool of the Year awards and actually spent the time to go back and look at them, thanks for coming out, you just further solidified our inclinations.  Our dear friend Flounder has discussed Edge 102s Top 102 of the 90s. While I agree with some of those choices, most of them are retarded. I mean what is a better song "Champagne Supernova" or "One Man Army" (by Our Lady Peace [most people have forgotten about this song, yet it ranks higher than an all time classic]). The fact that Noel Gallagher came up with the entire 'Whats the Story Morning Glory' album while he was krunked out of his mind, just makes it all the better. Finally 'Wonderwall' deserves to be higher than 11 that is just and outrage and there should be more of the Wallflowers (at least one of their songs) and Oasis should definetly have more than 2 fricking songs on the list, (not to mention more Weezer).  Man the theme for the Stewards rocks. The 90s man! I finally get to get out the old Aqua CD, not to mention Big Shiny Tunes 2  and Now 3. We now get to listen to the Danish fabfour again, not to mention the Spice Girls and Chubawamba. Horkins has me listening to all these old 90s songs like "Are you Jimmy Ray" by none other that Jimmy Ray [what ever happened to that dude man] And by the way... Kelly Grueber rules! 92/93 Jays were the shiznat... Prat that.  And in response to Shannon Cooper's feedback... Thank you very much for the intrest towards the site, we are honored that you found it to be a suitable platform to talk to the masses about some of the 'rumours' that have been going around in the past little bit.  However I feel that you are a little too hard on the Coopster... He may be obsessed with WWF, but shouldn't we all have our own little thing? I mean Horkins has his site, I have my devotion to automobiles (and various other interests), Bishop has Tiger Woods 2003, Cowie has his shoes and suits, and perhaps it could be argued that you have your obsession with experimental electronics. I mean can't we all just 'get along'...? And once again if you read this, thanks for visting the site and coming out. The Coopster rules, especially since he likes World Wildlife Fund.  "You inspired me bro.. Im a gonna go back to schoo Im a gonna work nights if I have to, you know at the DQ, no one blizzes like me!" -  A Horkins and Bateman collabiration.

      Yo this is my first time posting on Horkins' site. SO WUT UP!!! First of all I wanna say that HOrkypoo has THE MOST FORREAL WAI CHOY FANSITE in the world. I wanna send him a forreal shoutout. Horkins, that shiznat is forreal dawg. Oh SHIT you know what? we should get a pic of me with my bling from the movie on that page. THa would be more forreal than the forrealist of the forreal.   I personally agree that Seng Ik Song is a big tool. Not only IS he a big tool, but he probably HAS a small tool. It's actually quite ironic when you think about it.  [HL English analysis: 1. The use of the literary device of Contrast between "big tool" and "small tool" establishes a sense of irony around Korean Ick's tooliness. 2. Personification: Seng Ik is given life through being personified as a tool.]    What is the deal with this kid? He's all like "I know Tai Kwon Do. Dont make me beat you up." And I'm all like "go weave a sweater vest out of your pubes." I dont know what it is about him that makes me dislike him. Maybe it's the fact that he's asian. Naw...i doubt that's the reason. Asian people are forreal, man, no kidding. Especially us chinamen. REPRESENT. SEng ik cannot represent the chinaland though, since he is blatantly from Korea, as he is a Korean. Its funny how simple and lazy these Koreans are. Look at that. Their country is Korea. Add an n at the end and you have their nationality. Thats a big cop out if you ask me. I mean, honestly, what the hell, just add one letter? See, check this out. China. Chinese. Notice the extreme innovation and creativity that went into that. Im not Chinan. Im Chineeeeeeese. Like Nigga Pleeeeease. I mean, come on. Thats totally forreal.   In conclusion, it is fair to say that Seng Ik Songs tooliness is inversely proportionate to the size of his penis.   On another note, I gotta go to sleep cuz I have to be back on set for Mean Girls tomorrow. FORREAAAAAAAAAAAAL. Horkins, thanks again for the forreal publicity on your page man. EVERYONE SEE MEAN GIRLS WHEN IT COMES OUT. Its a forreal movie. Not like foolproof. Mean Girls is bigtime Hollywood. Its being produced by Paramount Pictures and has a lot of forreal hotshots in it. Forreal.    Peace out.  -Wai

It's like this union guy at Miller's HQ said "CUPE worked hard to elect David Miller", well I can't wait til the first CUPE strike cause then all the sorry asses that voted for him will realise that they fucked up and Toronto is fucked.

       urlLink The Top 102 Songs of The 90's   Before you click on this link, let me sum up what Edge thinks of the 90's. The number one song is apparently RHCP's "Under The Bridge", which I won't disagree with, it's a great song I just didn't expect it to be the number one (at 2 is Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit"). The list is very heavy on RHCP, Nirvana, U2, The Hip and Radiohead. For example, the top ten is RHCP, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Blur, RHCP, Foo Fighters, Beastie Boys, Weezer, RHCP and Nirvana. With so many repeat artists it becomes more of an "oh there's another Pearl Jam song" kind of list. And there's a severe lack of Oasis! The fact that Radiohead's "Creep" is only 68 and that ahead of it at 67 is Creed's "Higher" (ugh..) practically discounts the whole list. But all in all it's a good representation of the 90's era rock music. Holler at it.  Bateman, you know more about this kind of music, maybe u wanna holler at it.  PAYCE

       urlLink Rate My Teachers.com   Check this shit out. I had no idea there was some kind of rating system online for UCC teachers. It's pretty accurate but kinda bullshit. For example the number one rated teacher is Del from Aramark. And the worst rated teacher is Ben Sinclair.  I left some comments most of which are either perfect or the lowest scores you could give. I gave Hoody perfect cause he thought i gave him a bad review. I added another zero to Arkin's pile. And rated some other teachers.  So check it out essays. Paaaaaaayce!

      CHHOOOOO GUUUYYYY!!! Wat up homie people.  Cooplander is headed off to California to chill with the world's most beautiful people.  Hoping to get a psycho tan (whatever that means).  Think I'm gonna skip Muscle Beach, I ain't lookin' to buy steroids.  I'm landin' in Frisco tomorrow, hopin to get out of there quickly, wouldn't want some guy getting the wrong idea.  Ugghhh, even I'm disgusted by that one.  Speaking of being disgusted... by now I know that all of you know about my sister's "actions" last weekend (seems I'm writing about my sister in every one of my posts, weird)  I guess some of the details of the events of the night were made a little hazy.  I guess they didn't know about the video tape, Elan just said he was charging the battery on it and just never left.  I actually had to talk to Mr. Lowndes and some counseller about the whole incident.  Very weird, uncomftorable, and a shitty day in general.  Could be worse though my sister had to talk to her vice-principal at Branksome for 1 1/2 hours yesterday.  They actually got pissed off at her about it.  The only reason they found out is because Mr. Adams phoned them about it. Dillhole.  I asked him to put a microwave in the LDH 3 weeks ago and he said he'd do something about it.  He hasn't.  Dillhole.  Sorry about the lack of posts lately.  I've had the figurative shit piling on top of me lately.  I'll be happy to survive this next week.  Haven't worked on the Cowie/Bateman fight lately, but I'll probably have some time for it on the plane ride to California.  Hopefully I can find a way to post from out there as I know this is a much anticipated showdown.  Wai's site rules!!!  He's on yahoo actors too.  Check that shiznatch out!

      It seems the on-page ads are gone. Hopefully for good. Cause I was not about to go to the trouble of moving the site.  A lot of people have been asking about this story so... By Popular Demand... Here is the Story that won the halloween contest and got me a standing ovation in assembly (a dream I never thought I would fulfill...  The  Scariest  Halloween Pumpkin!!!  By Chris Horkins   This story is awesome, and by awesome I mean totally scary.  This story is about two guys who are best friends. Their names are Eric and Jamaal. Eric and Jamaal had one thing in common: they both freakin loved Halloween. When school started Eric would be all like Yo Jamaal, Halloween is like totally 2 months away! and Jamaal would be all like For real dawg, I cant wait! This happened pretty much every day until finally when Eric checked his daily organizer for the date he went to Jamaal and was all like Halloween is like totally tomorrow! and Jamaal was too speechless so he kinda just stood there for 3 and a half minutes until Eric finally said We need to get ready!  They both skipped school that day, which was pretty gangster if you ask me. First, they hit up the candy store. They figured they would get mad candy for free on Halloween so they didnt buy any but still looked at it... Then they hit up the costume store.  They both dressed up and got their costumes, which were sweet. Eric was a ninja. Jamaal was DMX. The next stop was more of an accident. They went to this store that looked really spooky and sweet but it turned out it was full of these 32 year old virgins wearing black makeup, playing Magic Cards, and saying things like All Hallows Eve is a festival of evil and the devil! Eric and Jamaal were all like Pssssht we are so out of here and left. They wondered what else they would need. Finally Eric said Cho guy! A pumpkin! Not just any pumpkin, the scariest Halloween pumpkin ever!  On the way to the pumpkin store, Eric and Jamaal encountered a crazy thing. It was a talking pumpkin. The pumpkin rolled up beside them and went BOO! Eric and Jamaal were scared. This had to be the scariest Halloween pumpkin ever. They picked it up and took it home. They would look so cool if they had this pumpkin so they trapped it and kept it in Erics garage.  Halloween night rolled around. Eric put on his totally awesome ninja costume. He was ready to ROCK (or ready for bed)! Jamaal was lookin fly in his pimptight DMX outfit complete with Cradle2ThaGrave T-shirt. They took their talking pumpkin out his cage, which they made from a Nintendo64 box and some duct tape, and decided to have some fun.  They placed the talking pumpkin, who they named 50-Cent, on a deserted street corner and said to it 50, listen up. When some kid dressed as something lame, like a pirate, walks by, you have to really scare him so he soils himself. If you succeed everyone will be all like holy crap! The pumpkin was not pleased. My name is not 50-Cent. It is VineDemon the Damnd! I am not a part of your childish schemes. I am an emissary from the deepest depths of Hell. You will pay for your disrespect!  At first, Eric and Jamaal were like Yeah, sure 50-cent, just scare the pirates but then 50 started growing until he was as big as a Cadillac Escalade (on 24-inch rims!). Fire belched forth from his gaping jaws as if they were the gates of hell themselves.   Eric soiled himself.  You have disrespected Satan on his sacred night of evil. You will experience the true meaning of suffering in the seventh circle of Hell! Satan himself will be-  Just in time, a huge Cadillac Escalade (on 28 inch rims) ran over the pumpkin and squashed him spraying pumpkin parts all over the street. In the Escalade was, who else but DMX himself, who thought that Jamaals costume was so awesome and sweet that he gave them a ride to the richest hood where every house gave out like full chocolate bars and you never got raisins.  It was the best Halloween ever.  THE END  Word Count: 666

      After a long Flounder hiatus, I attempted a revolutionary "live as it happens" post as bishy's theatre party a few days ago.  Sadly, due to his unergonomic mouse, that glorious post was deleted.  This one comes in response to Horkins' pitiful plea and the fact that I just returned from a pretty boring night.  After some good pratting with booth and bish, we went to Daisy's house for awhile.  It was pretty boring, but Daisy is a cute girl and I schooled her in pool.  I am just waiting for some...stuff...to download so I decided to prat up the blog.  I could sense that flounder has missed my erudite charm, after a long drought sprinked only with cooper's idiocy and bateman's incoherant rants.  I really wish I could provide some right now, but my senses are slightly dulled.  However, I think I know what we all enjoy at 1:26 AM......................................a six line play!  Setting -  A party.  Drugs and alcohol abound.  Loud music blares.  CHRIS is smoking some CHRONS and recieves a phone call from his DAD THE JUDGE.  CHRIS:  (coughs)  Uh....H-hello?  DAD THE JUDGE:  Christopher?  This is your father, the judge.  You haven't gotten arrested again, have you?  Your mother and I were just casually rifling through your underwear drawer and we discovered some shocking paraphernalia.  Nestled betwixt your boxer briefs was a visibly mangled copy of "Fat Titties Quarterly" , a small bottle of anal lube and a sock full of what appears to be cannabis marijuana.  Suffice to say, we are alarmed.  CHRIS:  Uh...those aren't mine!!  I'm, um, holding them for Bateman!    DAD THE JUDGE:  Hmmm...  I'm skeptical.  I  want  to believe you.  So I will.  I always knew that Ian Bateman was a no-goodnik.  Something about those agressive shoes he wears...  Nevertheless, your mother and I are placing you in a two-year drug and sex rehabilitation camp.  You'll love it.  It's in Kitchener and its run by a group of French-Canadian nuns.  You leave tomorrow.  CHRIS:  B-but Dad!  Tomorrow is my beloved dog, Scraps' birthday!  I bought him a new collar!  DAD THE JUDGE:  Hmmm... Yes, I forgot to tell you, I backed over Scraps this morning on the way to work.  See you at dinner.  *click*  End Scene     I hope you enjoyed that as much as I enjoyed the 10 minutes I spent writing it.  Hopefully, this show of force will entice fellow aficionados like alex bishop to post.  Oh, and also I think we should give Tapscott posting rights.  He can spin a good yarn and spends a lot of time in front of the computer.  If you know what I mean.  In the meantime, I'm off to haunt the night.  Peace kiddies.

      I had a pretty chillan time last nite at this Jackie Humphrey party, which I wasn't invited to but Glace dragged me too anyways and it was pretty fun until the cops showed up and I got all scared and decided to leave. But anyways I gotta say it's been pretty jamming since school got out. Holler! Peep grads2004 for some pictures of what's been pratting lately.  So here's my verdict on both my new albums:  The Black Album: This is a sick album. If every artist could only put this kind of effort into making a good album, WITHOUT having to retire after then it would be a perfect world. Jay-Z really wants to go out with a bang and he does. This album has a dream team of producers working on it including Just Blaze, Eminem, Kanye West, Timbaland, The Neptunes, and Rick Rubin (!!!). I have to say my favourite track is "Lucifer" the Kanye West track, I also like "Change Clothes", "Moment of Clarity", "99 Problems" fuckit... I like the whole damn thang.  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below: Speakerboxxx is basically the same ol' crunkin, dirrrrrrty south type hip-hop we've come to expect from OutKast. Big Boi continues this on really well, and he tries to innovate a bit but sticks to the formula. He shows that he is able to hold it down without Andre3000. The ATL is well represented. I love the track with Lil Jon called "Last Call" and "GhettoMusick" is also great. The Love Below is where this double album really shines. Andre3000, despite being one of the greatest rappers of our time, sings almost the whole album in a crazy falsetto type voice. The album is pretty much all about... well... sex. You can tell dre spent a lot of time planning out what he was gonna say. He raps occasionally, but the non-rap tracks don't disappoint. The slow jams are sick, the fast jams are sick. It's not just "Hey Ya!" either. I'm lovin this whole album, especially "Roses", "Happy Valentines Day", "Dracula's Wedding", "Vibrate".  It's great. Album of the year for Love Below alone, SpeakerBoxxx just makes it better. Cop it!  If U haven't already, and u're thinking about it, go cop these two albums. Cause they rule.

I also got OutKast's album(s) which I've yet to listen to. Holler. Well, thats all I got to say... paaaaaaaaaaaaayce.

       UCC Exam Marathon Finale!!!!!!    Theatre  This exam had no surprises. Every piece of paper with writing on it that we got had already been given to us prior to the exam. Everyone had their own little ideas and their own little concepts prepared so no one was feelin any pressure, it was just a big pissing contest to see who's ideas were the best (i.e.: me). Ergo, writing the exam was very chilling. I knew what I was going to write so I just wrote it. Organising my ideas was much easier to do than on most essay style exams because I had ideas prepared. I'm not sure what mark I'll get cause I don't know how much C-Money Lowndes is gonna like my idea, but I think he will. I'll "cop a mad six" as cowie might say. Very chilling.  Chillness rating : 4.5 Klons out of 5   RECAAAAP!!!        Subject     Klons Rating out of 5       English    5      French    Infinity Billion      Math Studies    pi (3.14)      Systems    4      Geography    3.9      Theatre    4.5     There you have it folks Now I'm gonna go enjoy my christmas break!

       UCC Exam Marathon    Geography   Okay, so going into this exam I had one thing in mind "I'm doing the structured questions on drainage and coasts, not the essays". And what happens? I do an Essay on drainage and a structured on Urban/Settlements. The thing with paper 2 was that the structureds were really specific and full of "define this" and "affluvial" that so I did a money essay on flooding. Mississipi case study, Bangladesh case study, blingin. And then the structured on urban was skeeeeeeeetch. I did examples from Mexico (i hope they were real) and Toronto (the projects, urban sprawl). Sketchiness. I didn't wanna touch Coasts cause that page was just fucke up, missing a question, one part was about rivers instead of coasts, etc. etc. But my answer on paper 1 was MONEY in tha bank. It was so easy to mix and match the countries. So aside from paper 2's sketchyness, this exam was kinda chillin, but my hand hurt after from so much writing... jeez.  Chillness Rating : 3.9 Klons out of 5  LAST EXAM TOMMORROW! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH!!!!!!!!

I know he's like the evilest man ever but when I saw that picture of him all scraggly, with that huge beard, all beat up I couldn't help but feel sorry for the guy. He used to rule with an iron fist. Now he's getting reamed with an iron rod... He kinda looks like Santa with the beard too... check it out  urlLink CNN   All I know is that this means very good things for Bush, which is bad for America, because whoever wins the Democrat Nomination is gonna have a mighty hard time knocking off that kid from Texas that bagged Saddam. Al Sharpton for prez. Also, Bin Laden is STILL out there. Scary. Rumours say he's abandoned the Taliban and is focusing on Iraq now... it's not over folks. Not by a long shot...

      My prediction was... a little off.  Stajan didn't even play. They benched him in favour of putting on the goon squad: Perrot, Belak, etc. If Nolan had been playing it would have never happened but I will forgive them cause they won 3-1. Goals were by guys I totally spaced on in my predict, Renberg knocked in two, Roberts one. New York goal was by some guy... I forget really, not Carter, and it wasnt a powerplay goal. Klee and Lindros did not fight. However, we got to see Domi-Barnaby, Perrot-MacDonald, and several other on-ice brawls. And the game was made more fareal by the private box I was seated in. It was pratworthy. Prime Rib saaaaandwhich... mmmmmm. For a better summary of the game check out tmlfans... its in the sideprat.  "Hey Dunham, You couldn't stop a Leaf Goal if it was playing on your VCR!"- me, heckling genius  Go Leafs GO!!! Peace.

      Cooper, I have to agree with you that the Leafs are going all the way this year. Which what I say every year. (Remember... "Leafs in Nine!") But man, don't vote for guys you hate to the all stars. That's the idea. You vote for your "favourites".  Leafs Game Tonight! YEEEEEEEEAH! I predict that the leafs will win 5-1 over the Rangers. Goals scored for the leafs by Sundin, Stajan, Reichel, Niewendyk, and Antropov. Ken Klee will get in a fight with Eric Lindros. For the Rangers, I'm gonna say Anson Carter will beat Belfour on a lucky powerplay goal (Perrot, 2 minutes for "roping?"... i mean roughing), he's a brotha playin a sport dominated by whitey and he's beating whitey's ass right now, I can respec' that. But not enough respec' to give this game to the Rangers. PS2 predicts a tie. PS2 is wrong. Go Leafs Go.  ps. cowie, thank you thank you thank you thank you

      K Horkins well now I just have to post my pics   The Legends    Goal -  Patrick Roy - For me as a goalie he has influenced my style more than any other goalie and he kicks ass!  Defense -  Bobby Orr, Borjes Salming - Can't forget Bobbo, he signed my stick once so he's cool and Borjes is cool he played for the leafs yo!  Centre -  K I'm not picking him cuz he's like the best ever, but like cuz he looks like a model and has like his own clothing line, having a clothing line is my dream one day... actually it isn't but it's WAYNE GRETZKY!!  Right Wing -  Mike Gartner - He played for the leafs and he scored lots and lots of goals like I mean a lot!  Left Wing -  Louis Burlinguette - He's my great granpappy yo and he played for like the Canadiens and started the Vancouver Millionares so give him some PRAT respect!  K now it's time for my current all star picks  East: G-Martin Brodeur - I hate him so much!! But he's good and he's Canadian so he get's some respect D-Sergei Gonchar, Brian McCabe - Gonchar has 28 points this season! That's one less than Sundin! C-Robert Lang - Can't argue with 35 points.  So what if Jaromir Jagr's his linemate! W-Ilya Kovalchuk, Jaromir Jagr - Ilya is a cool name and he's dragging the Thrashers to respectability.  I hate Jagr, but he's playing well this year.  West: G-David Aebischer - He's following in the footsteps of Roy and he's doing an amazing job, 14 wins! D-Mathieu Schneider, Rob Blake - Remember when Schneider played in Toronto?  Well he sucked, and now he's good.... bastard C-Andrew Cassels - He's Canadian and he's John Cassels's uncle.  You know the guy who threw the crap down the elevator W-Markus Naslund, Todd Bertuzzi - These guy's kick some serious ass, and Bertuzzi's Canadian, Naslund's a swede, but so's Sundin, so I'll let it slide this time.   Write in: Ed Belfour  The Leafs are winning the Stanley Cup this year! I'm burning a CD in preperation with like Queen's - We are champions and like other celebratory music, cuz the Leafs are finally winning!! Its all cuz Joe Nieuwendyk is here this year, he's like a rabbit's foot! We Will Win!!  "We are the champions... of the world!!!!" Queen - We are the champions

Why am I in a hockey mood? Cause tommorrow I'm seeing Joe Niewendyk and The Toronto Maples Leafs square off against Anson Carter and the red hot New York Rangers with Cowie (thank you thank you thank you thank you!!!!!!!!!!).... oh and it's in a private box, with like STAFF who get food and drink for you.

      My boy  urlLink Jin  was all up on 106 an Park today. The more I think about it, this guy is a craaaazy rapper. You should seriously download some of his freestyle friday battles cause they are insane. So anyways, Jin was premiering the video to his new joint of the day "Learn Chinese" (oh yeah... he's asian). And then he judged freestyle friday. This white kid won his second week as champ, and he was pretty good too. It's weird how there's been so many freestyle friday champs that were like, rap-minorities (uh... not black i guess is what im saying). Jin, WhyteOut... crazy. Just shows that if u got flow u can come up in the game. But enough of this rap talk.  Man Tuesday could not come any faster. 4 days...

       UCC Exam Maratharalon Uptizzle    Systems  Boys, the end is near. I can smell it. After writing my only exam of the week, I have but to wait until after Geo and Theatre and then PAARTYtime! w00t! Okay so systems. I really expected this to be a very hard exam. It had massive potential for hardness (hmmm... that last sentence didnt sound quite right), but it did not live up to that potential. Paper one was good, straightforward, some multiple choice q's were a little tricky but overall it was good. Paper 2 was sweet. Everything I studied was on it. It was very nice. Paper 3 had some hard essay q's and one easy one on CO2s that everyone did cause it was soooo easy.  chillz ratizzle:  4 Klondizzles out of Fizzle  The Izzle

      K Horkins I agree with you.  We were talking too much about shit that isn't entertaining and it doesn't even matter at all.  So I'm not even gonna use my last post on the topic to defend my position and I suggest that Bateman does the same.  Oh and Spence as much as you may have been disgusted at how crappy the stuff we were writing about was.... it's still better than one word posts... well maybe...  Horkins man saw that badger site on Sunday.... when I was drunk out of my mind, so f'n trippy, if you are inebriated in any way try to stay away from this site.  That site drove me crazy... gaaa!! Just to let u all know.  Writing an exam with a hangover... not a good idea.... not by a long shot... ugggg  Anyways I don't really have anything to talk about here, just wasting my last post on music here.  But be forewarned without anything to talk about I may dissapear back into the shadows from whence I came.  "I woke up in my mother's arms. Grandma take me home, I wanna be alone..."

      I've been looking over our little "90's rock debate" and it is very clear that it's possibly the most boring thing we've talked about pretty much ever. It was fun at first makin lists an all but now I think we have to do as my illustration suggests:     As administrator of the blog, here is my decree. This debate sucks. Everyone is allowed 1 more post on it so speak your peace. Then we find somethin new. No one cares if Radiohead is better than coldplay or if nirvana is better than oasis... at least i dont anymore.

      Finally! Someone agrees with me! Courtney Love that crazy bitch killed Kurt!  I think I wrote about that before though so I'll spare you my preaching and talking... if you want to read more about this go to Tom Grant's website  urlLink  .  Ok Chris.  I hear you, the RS rating gave Nevermind a 3 star rating, but have you read the actual review?  It is a fucking Nirvana love fest and if you look one disc up you'll see that In Utero was given 4 stars.  Now doesn't that seem weird?  I'd say most people agree that Nevermind was a better album then In Utero, but according to these RS ratings it is not.  As well, if you look at the Rolling Stone top 500 albums, hmm... what's at 17? Why it's Nevermind!  But how could Rolling Stone which gave the album a 3 star rating rate it so high?  You see rolling stone doesn't pay attention to the ratings given back in 1991 and neither should you.   Now I'll admit I love Radiohead.  In fact I'm listening to them right now, but their influence was not anywhere near as grand as Nevermind.  And Bateman I never want you to mention album sales again. Never. In fact I feel like disproving that whole argument right now.  First you have to look at who the album was made for.  Nevermind was made for true fans of Nirvana, it was not made to sell x million copies of the CD.  He made it for a certain type of fan.  And that album appealed to that fan, but as a happenstance it gained a large following throughout the world.  Oasis on the other hand made an album that seemingly appealed to everyone, adults, children, teenagers, everyone, so more people bought their cd.  Nirvana did not appeal to the adult generation, it did not appeal to children.  This was music for teenagers.  Teenagers don't have too much money, but the album still sold like hotcakes.  Another point, look at when these albums were released, Nevermind was released in 1991, now if my memory serves me correctly (probably not) but the united states was just getting out of the Reagan era.  So money was not readily available to everyone.  Now look at when WTSMG was released, 1995.  Economy everywhere was recovering people had money to spend.  So don't use the argument anymore about album sales.  Album sales mean shit all.  Anyways I've said enough about this.   "When masturbations lost its fun, you're fucking breaking!" Green Day - "Longview"  Thought I was gonna quote Nirvana eh Coops has left the building.

      Let me explain why  Nevermind  is not on my list of top 5 modern rock albums. The thing is, I really do not "get" the whole Nirvana thing. They were a good band, and they put out some very good music. Were they the greatest thing ever? Were they something really special? In my opinion: Not really... "Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a classic song but definitely NOT the best song the 90's produced. After some deliberation, I'm gonna have to hand it to "Under The Bridge", or Weezer's "Say It Ain't So". Nirvana is significant because they represent the whole "grunge" movement of the 90's, which produced a lot of really shitty music and some good music like Nirvana, Green Day, etc. Why not Oasis? Me and bateman disagree on Oasis a lot... I think they are as much of a great band as the next guy. He thinks they are mega. Don't get me wrong cause they are really awesome, but they are not by far the second Beatles. The Bends is my number one album because Radiohead is no question the most innovative rock band of the last decade, and The Bends is the solidest album they ever put out. I know we all were shitting on rolling stone a while back but I checked their reviews of our top albums and I pretty much agree with them. Nevermind is 3 stars, good, nothing special. What's The Story nabbed 4 stars, great album, solid. The Bends, as you can prolly guess was a 5-star album, which RS doesn't just hand out all the time (actually the RS site says 4 stars but they lie because I saw the magazine where they reviewed it)  And Bateman, your V-sign is a gang sign so SHUTUP.... ssssss.

      Coops,  (Whats the Story) Morning Glory?  by Oasis deserves to be the #1 album of the modern era. Yes  Nevermind  is a great album, and will forever be remembered. Both albums are equal in terms of significance, both embodied the sounds of a generation, both are brilliantly written,  Smells Like Teen Spirit  is definetly the best song of the decade. But when it comes down to sheer popularity and album sales, nothing beats  (Whats the Story) Morning Glory? . When writing my list, they were first tied, but then when you consider the hype behind Oasis at that time, it just nosed ahead. People were calling them the second Beattles, the future of rock and roll, Noel Gallagher even stated that he needed Oasis' first album to be the biggest thing since,  Nevermind , other wise he felt that it would not be worth doing, Definetly Maybe was the biggest album to come out since Nevermind, and (What's the Story) Morning Glory just went that needed bit extra. Just like Nevermind you can listen to the entire album from start to finish, and there were 6 top 10 hits on it, when the album only had 10 real songs (two of them were interludes), two of the singles went platinum (600,000 units sold), and there were 7 songs that went #1 in various countries. Serious numbers to say the least. When it came out many journalists hailed it to be the first definite rock album of the decade. All of this just inched it ahead of  Nevermind , which was left out of Horkin's list. But it would have been interesting to see what Nirvana could have come up with had Kurt not been killed (yes he was murdered, look at the evidence).  Anyway thats my rant on music for the week.  Bishop, Proc definetly writes a fooker of an exam. It was not pretty, apparently last year's had to be bell curved by 20%. Fookin horseshit. Give us an exam that shows what the fook we can do, not what fooks us up, and thank you for making fun of my grammar, and that really boosts my confindence, and i don't even know what a comma splice is. (I really don't). Anyway that artists depiction Horkins did for you should be framed, classic. The BSS grads site is the bomb. Apparently the V sign is a gang sign. Who knew? The pic of lace and the TV is priceless.  "You could wait for a life time, to spend your days in the sunshine. You might aswell do the white line, cause when it comes on top.. You gotta make it happen!...."

       Feeeeedback    girly class of '03 writes...  "it makes me sort of sad that a bunch of us have gone to college and we still read this blog. thats a lie, no it doesn't. it makes me happy. cause we love you boys... boyeees!  we like high school boys.  love the girly class of '03"  And we like college girls. A lot. But seriously, I want to know which girls of that girly class ever did read, and apparently  STILL  read the world's pimpinest blog. I never knew they did.Who are you? This represents a large jump in FOL readership. We are now firmly planted into higher education. Which is cool. Also we have confirmation that girls like us. (whoa!)

      Man, I am glad I do not take history cause from what the Big E and Cowie are sayin, the exam is HARD. Geo, once again, is a very good call. Lots of Field Trips. Lots of videos. And NYC is the pimpinest time you'll ever have, trust me. And when you're stumped by some chump at a cocktail party cause you don't know when the war of 1812 was, at least you know where tajikistan is on a map, or what the capital of Zimbabwe is (hint: it's Harare). Cause you know that structured questions are better than two essays in an hour...  Anyways, after seeing our friends winks and stoneman last night they told me to go post on  urlLink THEIR website  and then they would come back and post here. So I did. And for the record, grads2004 isn't fronting on FOL turf cause this is a blog and that is a photo website dealy. I encourage you all to check it out.

      "Heeeerrres Johnny!!!!" Except change johnny to COOPLANDER!!! yeah i'm back after lets see when did i last update.... hmm... 2 weeks now.  Anyways a lot has gone on here in the last few weeks... exams, more top 10 lists and the return of bateman and bishy.    I was surprised that I was the only one that Bishy didn't bust a nut on.  Sounds like a super crazy booth level hangover.  By the way to defend Chris and Bateman... every music list everywhere is full of personal biases, Bish try to make a list and not have your own personal bias on it.  Like at least they know all these styles pretty well.... like I wouldn't even try to make a list... i'd make an ass of myself... I don't know anywhere near as much about music history as these guys... so I think props gotta be handed out to those two. So PROPS!! Oh and Bishy I'm very interested about this electric wheelchair... VERY interested.  Bateman I gotta comment on your top ten modern rock album list (only one I know anything about) Nevermind... man that's number 1.  Like you used the defence that Oasis sold more than any other album in the 90's. That's such a bs defence, like so many things factor into that, and if you go by that then Eminem owns the best album in history.  You cannot argue with the influence every single song on Nevermind had on music.  I realize a lot of their other stuff is overrated, but this album was amazing from top to bottom.  Like album sales mean shit all in how good an album is and you know that.  By that defence The Pixies and  The Velvet Underground were total shit, I don't buy that.  Sorry for getting on that rant, but like album sales?  That's a cop out man, get a better argument.  I know you can.  It's time for my annual WWF plug.  Yes I love the pandas, I can't help it.  You know which panda you should check out?  It's this thugged out panda from Massachuestes (yeah i know i can't spell)  He's all like thugged out and shit.  You cross this panda wrong he'll smack you silly with a bamboo stick, then he'll diss you with a prat rap. He's got a degree in thuganomics, what do you got, you got shit on him.  This panda's gonna make the WWF more popular than sliced bread.  Me and Chris fightin tonight, thats awkward at first glance. Thats like a third grade dance over at Never Land ranch.  John Cena  Yo Coop is out! Word Life!

      I am very sorry for not posting for a while. My sheer laziness has taken over my entire life. I have even started to wear adult diapers and am thinking about purchasing an electric wheelchair. On another note, after blogger had been so backed up (or constipated as you might say ROUND), I found myself reading the number of posts blogger had voided from its sytem. All I want to know is where you guys get off thinking you know everything about music? Your personal biases are splurged all over these lists much like Moses and that 10 commandments thingy. God I am really not funny right now. Maybe it is my hangover. No but honestly, friggin shut up! I am tired of reading these lists and reviews that lack ratings out of klons. And griff, references to acid and speedballs? Very unprofessional. That was an intense sentence fragment. And bateman, I know my posts are far from pefect but yours lack so much grammatical correctness that WT is spinning in his armchair as I type. More sentence fragments and comma splices than cooplander could ever dream of (yes i know that was a fragment.) Frig.  Anywho, the methods exam was hella intense. It defecated all over my chest, and my body. I studied so hard for this exam. I even stayed at the school after the French exam until my tutor at 8:00pm. After beginning to like Procunier, I now have much disdain for such an anti-chron exam he put together. I started to get some mad 70s on tests by the end of term and then he pulls out these giant nugs of poo (I am speaking of both papers here). Such nugs. Nuggier than ricci. Frig. Ya so paper one was disgustingly hard. I left a few blank and totally screwed over some others. Maybe if I had more time and less names like "Arturo" comin at me from the exam. WHere the hell do they get the names for word problems in math any how? 'Arturo is training for an enchilada eating contest. If he starts out with 3 enchiladas on monday...' What is going on?-joe schmo. Ya so paper two was impossible as well. I left a whole wuestion pretty much blank cuz i couldn't figure iout one part. Ya so proc should quit yoga and stick to creating easier exams. Frig. Fucking kangaroos.  ps. Horkins please draw me a picture of me getting defecated on by both papers and them high-fiving and then doing yoga later. I don;t know how. thank you.

      To clarify my position on Jazz, I like it. I have nothing against it, except when Jazz comes and tells me that it was more influential than Hip-Hop, then me and Jazz got beef. Cause the thing is, while very innovative and blah blah blah Jazz was just a new way of using the same instruments to create music that sounded different but in the end its the same kind of sound. With hip-hop, you have the invention of new instruments (aka the turntable, etc., digital mixing) PLUS a whole new way of vocal expression that had really never been done before. I still believe that when we look back at the 20th century hip-hop will stand out as the most innovative form of music to come along. And yeah, in concept, hip-hop is based on jazz. Jazz was the first Harlem renaissance, and hip-hop was the second. There is heavy sampling from Marvin Gaye (im listening to it right now...), Steve Wonder, James Brown, and others. But that just adds to the innovation of hip-hop. I mean, sampling, remixing? That was huge. It's become such a big part of music now. Believe what u want, but this is my "position" on this issue, or whatever.  But yeah, if u need a better explanation of this math exam (i realise that my first one was rather... brief), then I drew another picture...     So, as you can see paper 1 is very similar to the french exam... paper 2 is much harder. I think the drawing speaks for itself.  payce

      Dear McG, You are quite correct in saying that  LA Woman  is better than The Doors' self titled debut. I felt that it should go ahead of LA Woman, just based on sheer significance and impact. But then again, this contradicts Mr. Bob Dylan being put behind Jim and the boys, because without him there would never have been The Doors. My other feeling is that it was the Dylan experience, rather than his albums that made such an impact, while Highway 61 and Free Wheelin' are gems, are they as good an album as Dark Side of The Moon, or Sgt. Peppers? We're talking albums here. But agreed Dylan is a better songwriter than Morrison, it just happens that Riders on the Storm is one of my personal favourites. However one of my favourite modern day bands, is the Wallflowers, headed up by Jakob Dylan, Bob's son, and there is a little bit of a carry over between father and son, if you haven't heard them definetly worth a look, especially Bringing Down the Horse, great stuff. I do invite your rebutal, and have to commend you on your analogy of Dylan and Morrison when they meet up in heaven (assuming Jim is there, and that Bob is going there). Thanks for the comments.  Now about this Jazz notion that JJ has no fooking clue aboutl. I am not a huge cult follower of Jazz, like WT-Unit, but Jazz forms the fookin basis of hip/hop and R+B. What form first brought the bass and precussion together, and played them at the same time? Jazz! What is the backbone of Hip Hop and R+B? (and its not a computer) Its the bass and the drums, sorry but it just is, whether its a variant of the two, you can't have a beat without them. Fact of the matter is JJ in ten years if you look back at the twentieth century two things are gonna stand out, Jazz and the Beattles. Simple as that. Maybe in 2050 when we look back at the past 100 years, then we will see hip hop for more than it seems in retrospect today, but time will tell. Right now though, jazz beats form the basis of hip hop tracks, whether it takes up 0.1% of the beat, they're there in every single song, and more often than not rap and hip hop songs take their structure from jazz. Like it or not JJ it's true. Very True. And if you don't like jazz, that doesn't matter you still have to admitt it's importance. Louis Armstrong is the man.

       Teacher Feedback    Steven Griffin aka G-Prime writes...  "There is NO f'n way that the Doors first album is better than LA Woman...not a chance...listen to both albums again.    While I am at it, I haven't had a chance to scold Bateman in person, so I will write it here...Dylan is, was, and will always be a better song writer than Morrison...even when they're doing speedballs in heaven, Morrison will be like "Bob, can I kiss the ground you walk on", and Bob will be like "Jim, get rid of those pithy comments that make high school kids think you're a genious, and maybe we'll talk...stop rhyming rest with best, and summer with summer, and we'll talk". Jim will shake his hair, put about 20 tabs of acid in his coke, and skulk away, knowing that he should have never even asked, and it's all because of people like Bateman who took him seriously...Really, back door man is a great song, but c'mon....   G prime"  Here it is... actual physical proof that Mr. Griffin reads the blog like every day. I'll let Bateman respond to this crazy music stuff, i mean i like Bob Dylan man that song subterranean homesick blues is great but I also like the doors, but not as much as 50. And thanks Mr. G for that "whoa studies" before the exam today.

This was an easy exam. Set by the most cultured man in the world, Keith Fleming, who is my favourite French Teacher of all time. Holy shit! This exam was easy. I finished Paper 1 before any one else and cowie and toope at the back werent even looking to see if someone was finished yet. I had like an hour between papers. Paper 2 was just as easy, i did the debate on computers... soooooo easy. If I don't get a 7 I don't know WHAT went wrong. Here, let me illustrate how this exam went down:     So as you can see, this exam was easier than a certain member of leaving class '04's cousin. In my own words "mon dieu, quelle blague..."  Chillness Rating : Infinity Billion Klons out of 5  Check back tommorrow for Studies which will be chillin 2 tha max but there is no way it will be as superchillayin as French, its just not possible. payce

      I haven't checked tha feedback in a while so i apologise for tha lateness here.  I got one that just made me angry, i was jus like "yo... what the fuck guy?" when I read it... You ever get that where ur just like "damn that was racist" but it actually wasnt racist it just made u mad... well yeah this is it:   "Euh... I just looove Jazz" writes:  "the most innovative form of music in the last 100 years is anything but rap.  (jazz)"  SHUT UP! You obviously do not know what ur talking about. Rap is sweet and by that I mean totally awesome. Let's look at the last hundred years of music, shall we...  Okay so 100 years ago, your chillin, listening to the popular music of the time which apparently is Jazz (yeah I looked it up, what?), so u're peepin the newest track either "The Woodchuck Song" by Robert Hodart Davis or "The Beer That Made Milwaukee Famous" by Dan McAvoy an ur cool jus listening to it and so is everybody else. Just listening to your pianos and your trumpets and it's all good.  Fast forward a couple decades and you get rock and roll, a bunch of black dudes start sangin' and playin guitars and tambourines and makin music and everyone is like "OH MY GOODNESS! What is that coloured man doin on tha stage?" And Rock and Roll becomes very contraversial, and only the kids like it but they dont tell their parents. Every self respecting white guy in the nation is afraid to like rock and roll... until this white dude named Elvis starts doin it, then it's okay.  The 60's roll around and rock has become this big PROTEST thing. People are using music for Politics now and it's a pretty new concept. Suddenly the musicians have a bigger following than the politicians. John Lennon says he's bigger than Jesus and everyone's like "Did he just say he was bigger than Jesus?" Well yeah and if Jesus said he was bigger than the Beatles would u be shocked? No cause u dont go to church and u wouldnt care. But before u can care its the 70s and this thing called disco is here and everyone is dancing and bustin a groove. There are movies, and clubs, and fashion that goes with it. Very new, very hype.  Alrite so around the end of the 70's, some black guys in New York start having these underground "rhyming contests" where one black guy tries uses rhymes to diss the other black guy to the beat of drums, very african type shit. Then they get the idea to add in a turntable, the art of DJ-ing is created. Together with MC-ing (rapping), B-boying (breakdancing), and graffiti (not vandalism, artistic graffiti) they make up this new culture known as "Hip-Hop". They start recording this shit and actually putting it on cassette and CD. And all of a sudden all the white dudes are like "Who is this GrandMaster Flash and the Furious Five" character?" None of the white people know what do. This shit is so different from anything anyone has ever heard. But the kids LOVE IT. Flash, Slick Rick, and others pave way for RUN-DMC. In 1984 Run-DMC records rap's first classic album (their self titled debut). But basically in the 80's rap is such a shock to the mainstream music system that its basically a very edgy type of music. By the early of the 90's you have several rap devoted record labels, the two primary ones being Suge Knight's LA based DeathRow Records featuring a cats like Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Tupac Shakur, and Sean "Puffy" Combs's NYC based BadBoy Entertainment featuring the hottest young star: The Notorious B.I.G. This results in a huge "gang war" and Gangsta Rap is suddenly huge. Pac gets shot. Biggie gets shot. Rap becomes mainstream. Suddenly all the kids that liked rap in the 80s are young adults. And all the old white dudes are still all like "Rap music? More like CRAP music!"  But in the end it comes down to this: No genre has changed the public's perception of what "music" is more than rap. No other type of music has become this popular this fast. No other type of music was this innovative.  In conclusion, you smell.

      It's baaaaaaaaaaaaack!   The UCC Exam Marathon Update: Christmas '03 Edition   We did this only like 5 months ago so y'all know tha drill. I'm ratin the UCC Exams each with a summary and a "chillness rating" which is in FOL tradition, out of 5 Klondike Cones. First up, English.   HL English: Wayne Tompkins  As always English is a breeze. WT provided us with 4 very writeable essay questions, most people I talked to including me wrote number 4 which was about setting (can someone say SETTING? IOP to tha rescue) and character portrayal. I compared McTeague and Gawain but a lot of peeps did Othello and Oedipus. Which just shows how flexible these questions are. I was able to throw in some quotes, and put together a respectable essay with time to spare in the end. No way I was writin to the last second stayin in the last ten cause u cant leave. I was outta there. Supa chillin.  Chillness Factor : 5 Klons out of 5  if anyone has any comments, additions, questions, raps, post it up and if u have an exam i dont then take it away... im not writin it like "Computers was hella easy" or like "Higher Math was soooo hard!" or "Latin was E Pluribus Unum..." I got nothin...

      Yeah Fucking Blogger destroying my beautiful post. I was in the zone too.. I had huge lists full of great albums. Anyway here goes..... I extended it to the Top 10 cause I wanted to, and cause Im an inconclusive little shit.   Top Ten Rap Albums:  1.  Ready To Die  - Notorious BIG 2.  All Eyez on Me  - 2pac 3.  Raising Hell  - RUN DMC 4.  It Takes a Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back  - Public Enemy 5.  People's Instinctive Travels and The Paths of Rhythm  - A Tribe Called Quest 6.  Illimatic  - Nas 7.  Midnight Maurauders  - A Tribe Called Quest 8.  Grip It on That Other Level  - Geto Boys 9.  Eric B. and Rakim  - Paid In Full 10.  Me Against The World  - 2pac     Top Ten Classic Rock Albums:  1.  Dark Side of the Moon  - Pink Floyd 2.  Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band  - The Beattles 3.  Who's Next  - The Who 4.  Revlover  - The Beattles 5.  II  - Led Zeppelin 6.  Let It Bleed  - The Rolling Stones 6.  Abbey Road  - The Beattles 7.  Wish You Were Here  - Pink Floyd 8.  The Doors  - The Doors 9.  Highway 61  - Bob Dylan 10.  Are You Experienced?  - The Jimmy Hendrix Experience   Honorable Mentions:   LA Woman  - The Doors (Brilliant, Riders on the Storm is the best Doors song),  American Woman  - The Guess Who (a must have for any aspiring band), The Who -  Quadrophenia , Led Zeppelin -  IV , The Kinks -  You Really Got Me  (check out anything by the Kinks, great stuff), The Who -  My Generation  (a soundtrack for a generation, and the mods), Led Zeppelin -  Houses of the Holly , The Rolling Stones -  Sticky Fingers , Nick Drake -  Pink Moon  (a great album from a guy who none of you have probably heard of but everyone in the business has), anything by  The Beattles , the list goes on and on.....     Top Ten Modern Rock Albums  1. ( What's the Story?) Morning Glory  - Oasis 2.  Nevermind  - Nirvana 3.  The Bends  - Radiohead 4.  Definetly Maybe  - Oasis 5.  Weezer (Blue)  - Weezer 6.  Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness  - The Smashing Pumpkins 7.  Ok Computer  - Radiohead 8.  Heathen Chemistry  - Oasis 9.  Siamese Dream  - The Smashing Pumpkins 10.  Urban Hymns  - The Verve   Honorable Mentions:   Be Here Now  - Oasis (underated even by the band themselves, definetly worth a look some really good stuff on it),  Is This It?  - The Strokes (a great album, time will tell how great though),  Kid A  - Radiohead (a great concept album),  Standing on the Shoulder of Giants  - Oasis (a great album, has an almost psychadelic sound to it, really good stuff)  Bringing Down The Horse  - The Wallflowers (a great album with some unique lyrical and musical elements),  Parachutes  - Coldplay (seen by some to be ahead of it's time),  Crash  - Dave Matthews Band (a great album, anything by Dave is going to be good).    There are two bands which I felt didn't fit into any of the categories outlined, but they definetly were two of the most influential.  The Sex Pistols  and  The Clash , while some of you (including at times me) can't always take some of their songs, the definetly were great regardless what you think about their music. If you want to talk about albums having a message behind them you cannot exclude these two bands.    "In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary, Come Again?"

      Yeah... Styx is still cool but not as cool as I thought they were back when I wrote that last post. I still encourage you to download "Come Sail Away", and "Lady"... and "Renegade". Apparrently Bateman shat (shitted?) all over my top 5 list(s) but blogger flushed his shit before he could post it. Fucking blogger...  I downloaded all these insane videos of this guy Jin on Freestyle Friday. He's an Asian Rapper (possibly a more famous asian that Wai Luon Choy?) and he totally ripped 7 suckas like 7 weeks in a row and got retired then he got signed to Ruff Ryders and let me tell you, this cat is for real. This one guy was all rippin him cause he was chinese, and he was just like "You makin fun of me bein chinese dog, here's a reminder, check ya Tims, they prolly say Made In China!" OOOOOOOOH SNAP! I also peeped his first single, it's called "Learn Chinese" and it's pretty hype. His album should be good.  An' speaking of Rap Albums, Adam Booth and Alex Tapscott in conjunction with Tom Bittner are putting together the first album of the yet to be named rap supergroup starring booth. I got to check Bitts's first beat that he made for it. It starts off with this chick goin like "can i touch it?" and then Bittner's voice but changed all high pitched like Alvin and the chipmunks goes "jyyyeah" and then these crazy bells and shit kick in and it's crazy. It's a slow beat so u'll be sure to hear some pretty sick rhymes on it. I think booth has some up in his ICQ "info"... So look forward to this album, I may just get featured on a track.  My album is still in the works as always.  Speaking of girls... this website is one big sausage fest right now... Katie, Winks, Sarah, any other female once involved in posting about like "poon shivers" and stuff... I know you all have your "own website" now but COME BAAAACK! pleasE? You can't just throw something so meaty like that last post to like, the readership of FOL and then not post for months. It's not righT! Look at COOPER! He's SALIVATING! Cooper came and asked me when those nice ladies were coming back and I had to tell him "I just don't know son, I just don't know..." And then he cried. So if that doesn't make u want to come back... i don't know what will.  Anywaaays, PAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYCE

      Alright, our shitting on the RollingStone is finally going to end here and maybe ten posts later as Bateman and co. in turn shit on this subsequent post. I decided that you really can't rank top albums of all time without separating the genres, it just does not work. How can you compare Tupac and the Beatles? You can't. It's comparing Apples, and much ghetto-er Oranges. So here are my several top 5 greatest album lists divided as such:   Greatest Rap Albums of All Time  1. Ready To Die - Notorious BIG 2. All Eyez On Me - Tupac 3. It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back - Public Enemy 4. Raising Hell - Run-DMC 5. Paid In Full - Eric B. and Rakim Hon. Mentions:  Life After Death - Notorious BIG,  The Marshall Mathers LP - Eminem,  Get Rich or Die Tryin - 50 Cent,  Word of Mouf - Ludacris,  Straight Outta Compton - N.W.A.   Greatest Classic Rock Albums Of All Time  1. Revolver - The Beatles 2. Sticky Fingers - The Rolling Stones 3. Dark Side of The Moon - Pink Floyd 4. Led Zeppelin II - Led Zeppelin 5. American Woman - The Guess Who Hon. Mentions:  Abbey Road - The Beatles,  Back in Black - AC/DC,  Who's Next - The Who,  Slowhand - Eric Clapton,  Are You Experienced? - Jimmy Hendrix   Greatest Modern Rock Albums Of All Time  1. The Bends - Radiohead 2. What's The Story, Morning Glory? - Oasis 3. Weezer - Weezer 4. Fully Completely - The Tragically Hip 5. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness - The Smashing Pumpkins Hon. Mentions: A Rush Of Blood To The Head - ColdPlay,  OK Computer / Kid A / Amnesiac - Radiohead,  Take Off Your Pants And Jacket -Blink-182,  Blood Sugar Sex Magic - Red Hot Chili Peppers,  Is This It -The Strokes  So there you go... commence disagreement but this is what I say. Holler at my list(s).

      Holla atcha boysssssssssssssssssss. Fa'real it was our first snow day in maybe five years and it was hype. Oh I am so street it is ill. OK, enough with that garbage.  The list of things I like winter for has extended (tsssss). Here it is: 1) Skiing, hockey, NBA season, yadda yadda yadda 2) Erect nipples 3) Urinating in snow 4) Snow days.  I love lists and lisps.  Ya so I was ejected from my first professional sports event ever yesterday at the leaf game with Adam 'wildman' Booth. The kid is insane and always attracts trouble but is so fun to have in your posse. Word. It was super fun.  Horkins, your site is going bananas. The feedback is making this site so cool. Never post any of that incoherent drivel those branksome girls posted. Girls cannot even control their emotions or actions when they are drunk so they should never ever use a computer under the influence. Come on now. They should be quarantined. Jesus. I freakin haemorrhaged 12 times while reading that. So unnecessary. Yo cop the new incubus album when it is out on Feb. 3 i think is the date. They were intense on live@much.   Keep the river flowing. Of feedback i mean.

This time y'all can show me the real best hill in T-Dot. if not then just remember forever the day that school was cancelled and we went sledding:  urlLink SnowDay '04!!!!

       feedback   i was lucky to catch this one, it ended up in my junk folder probably due to the email address that was submitted...   fuckable@hotbody.com writes...  "hello from planet snow day  this is jackie and houston and claire reporting:  unfortunately we were too drunk to make it to the snow sledding excursion but we assure you, we were there in spirit  this is incredibly har dto type as i am plastered...   hmmm  sb eh? never been here before  we just finished watching a wondeful movie, one you may be familiar with, which starts barf, princess vespa, dark helmet claire is convulsing behind me and said shaizaa  hmm awkward  a word on oscar nominations: jackie will bone johnny depp in time  youll see  kind of  awkward  hahaha  he is very very hot and convincing as a drunken pirate.. kind of like claire.  she is my favourite pirate  keira knightly seems to be in 2 nominated movies but is so terribvle an actress that she deserves nothing. her ryan-esc facial expression.. singular.. is not oscar worthy.  yeah oc  this is all goodbye.  yeah drunken sno sledding tonigh second episode lp crew,,.... watch out"  You guys missed out... big time. Space Balls is a great movie, but another great movie I watched today was "Stealing Harvard" ("he's catching a whiff of my "gruyere's cheese"!!!"). Keira Knightley is mad hot, especially in Pirates but not so much in that soccer movie where she's all like a jock and tries to look un-hot... or something. This is why snowdays were created my friend. Look what the future of the world will do if u give them a day off! BEAUTIFUL! Keep it up ladies...  and for some reason a lot of these have ended up in the junk folder... weird  anonymous writes:  "Houston, dont lie. You wouldn't know SB if it hit you in the head. Thanks Jess. Hopefully the boys took notes (hint). Horkins, you have no life."  1) would everyone please stop hiding behind the cowardly anonymity of not saying who u are, especially if 2)u plan to say something that could be offensive (I count three insults) 3)If SB hit someone in the head, that would be gross...   ed kim writes:  "I happened to drop by dear ol' horkypoo after I realized that there's no @%#@ way that I'm writing an econ. commentary.  ??? Horkypoo is a great site, lots of posts, but I especially noticed the recent post that the BSS girls put up. ??? It's a funny post, very humorous, but it's sad that those girls cannot spell for shit. And to hear this from me, Ed Kim, is quite sad. ??? It's Gorgeous NOT georgous. ???  ??? S.B. sounds like a stupid acronym and with the oral sex part. Only if the bush is hacked clean or in the extreme case(I hope not), the jungle wiped out.?   ??? Just an opinion "  OH no he didn't! It's true, if Eddie Kim is correcting ur spelling then u know there's a problem. Thanks, it is a great site.  And there was one by  heidi  but this shit is getting old and I didn't want to post it... so SUCK IT! (remember D-X from old school WWF wrestling... well cooper does)

      Sledding is the shit. Cowie may be right when he said "sledding is awesome... then u turn twelve", but then u turn 17 and u get a snow day and u go sledding and it's even awesomer! Hopefully we get another snow day tommorrow and we can do some even more ill snow day activities. Yeah sledding!  You know who is an ill rapper? Immortal Technique (known to Spence as "immortal whatever"). Download the song "Dance With The Devil" and you will realise how street this guy is. When was the last time a rapper actually scared you with how thug he was... cause Immortal Technique will! Also check out Jedi Mind Trick, and Louis Logic... who are equally as ghetto.

      on this glorious snow day, somewhere were people are like "uhh.... whats snow? dango' chicken carbonarrra..." in LA the nominations for my favourite awards show was announced.   urlLink peep the Oscar noms   I have very few beefs with these noms this year. First of all, Lord of The Rings (aka one bomb-ass movie) will just own the whole show. Second, another of my favourite movies this year (Pirates, baby!) got a boatload of noms including best Actor for Johnny Dep. Third, Bill Murray (aka the best actor ever) is nominated for best Actor, he will win because Sean Penn is a retarded little kid who goes "knock knock... who's there.. BANANA!!!!!!!" (please see "I Am Sam", the worst movie ever made). Fourth, Charlize Theron is hot. Fifth, apparently a film from "Canada" is considered foreign. Sixth, Finding Nemo is a bomb-ass movie, and it will win the best animated shit.  My beef though is that the Best Song category is soooooooo WEAK. What was the hottest song off a movie sountrack this year? Three words: Shake Ya Tailfeather. We got lucky last year with eminem winning, now we're stuck back with shitty ass songs about nothing that no one ever heard or cared about... the end. Bad Boys II had the best soundtrack of any movie that came out this year, period.  and now... the other award show   urlLink peep the razzie noms   Now here is a list I can agree with. Gigli is definitely the worst movie of the year, possibly ever.   BUT WAIT  SLEDDING PARTY TODAY! AT HOGG's HOLLOW PARK AT 1:30! SOUT OF YORK MILLS ON YONGE! BE THERE OR BE SQUARE! BRING YOUR OWN SLED!!!!!

      alright guys... via the incredible feedback system, here it is, the single greatest feedback this site will ever receive, you wanted it, i wanted it, mr. steve griffin will avert his eyes... here it is   "How To Pleasure A Girl" by Winks  "Winks in the house dawg anyway thank you Branksome girls for previously including the origin of S.B. First, I would like to say sorry to those who are orally challenged. That must really suck for you. I really mean it; you must really take a class or talk to someone about it because S.B. is really the to life. Do not be embarrassed though many guys suck, just remember, practice makes perfect.  I am not going to lie S.B. is a tricky little thing. Us girls have come to master the B.J now it is your turn boys to blow us away with something a little more thrilling then a flinching finger (did I say that out loud? oops.).   Here is a taste of some tips that are essential boys:  1.      Start with a massage of the mons (aka the skin found on top the pubic bone above the vaginal opening)  2.      The way one uses their tongue is key.  -       For a more firm stimulation, one needs to have a more flexed and rigid tongue.  -       For a soft caress, a limp and flat tongue will suffice.  3.      Do not be afraid to use your fingers. There is nothing wrong with old fashion penetration here and there   4.      Do not intensely blow into the vagina during cunnilingus because there is a chance of a gas bubble forming in the blood stream. (Wait a minute no blowing is really that necessaryyet gentle stroking with the tongue, licking and sucking are.)  To conclude I thought I would give you this quote from a website I found. It really explains why men are so bad at S.B. so you should check it out if you are still a little confused.  Think of eating the puss as your way of saying, "although I am about to rock your insides with 3 000 lbs. of explosives, here's a little intimate treat session to show you how I really feel." Instead of a screaming "OH MY GOD!!" like her baby has been trapped under a car (which is what fucking should do), cunnilingus elicits a more splendiferous "ooohmygodohmygodohmygod." Kind of like being massaged with exotic fruits by a muscular Arab oil sheik. A good mange (that's French for "eat," you brutes) is like a thousand years of Saturdays or a "Calgon, take me away" ad. Break it down!  http://www.onlinesexguides.com/f_index.html   Peace out. Winks"  wow... i'm gonna go have some milk and cookies now and just think about what i read there

       nanananananana FEEDBACK!  (is the only thing still on this site these days...)   stupid kid writes:  "How do you know when you have ADD? THis is a serious question. plz answer  Love, stupid kid :("  Dear stupid, Actually Booth told me how this works today. You go to the ADD test centre, preferrably  blaaaaaaaaazed  (jus playin'...) and they sit you in front of a computer where the number 1 flashes in front of you every 5 seconds, and you have to click the 1 with ur finger every time it comes up. Apparently if u get bored before 10 minutes are up then u have ADD. If you have stopped reading this by now and are now attempting to climb a tree or something... then you have ADD.   Meg and Houston write:  "hello... we are first time users and we came across your site on the great grads2004 website.   by the way this is meg and houston.. writting on behalf of tiff and the other branksome girls who would like to clear up the misconceptions regarding the now well known term "S.B" (aka SCRUFF BURN)  The term "S.B" orginated near the end of Grade 10 as something that can occur after making out with a boy who had not recently shaved... resulting in something of a slight rash (awkward).  as time passed... and we all somewhat matured... "S.B" became something very special. Scruff Burn.... took on a whole new meaning... as tiff was no longer the make-out whore who resided close to our hearts....   Tiff then dubbed "S.B" as the code term that we would used when discussing oral sex on a girl... as we would often talk about our weekend exploits just beside the administrative offices at BH.  "S.B" can work both ways..... if a boy doesnt shave his face... then the girl gets scruff burn.... and if a girl doesnt shave... then the boy gets scruff burn! (wow, awkward!)   although the term is now commonly used in other girl schools... you have now learnt the true orgin of the term!  so it is not: - superbowl - spanking butts - space balls OR  - scott barter...  "S.B" = SCRUFF BURN  thank you.  - Houston and Meg"  This is a long feedback... perhaps the longest ever. It's very special because it's by two people, a  double email ! This is getting pretty intense. (please see  urlLink RUP  if u don't get the reference) I just hope that this doesn't "front" as it were on the upcoming post by winks on "how to pleasure a girl" and spence is right. This has turned into Girl in The Centre (remember, the dirtyness in convergence last year)... but this time I'm not so vehemently against it... i'm lovin it (badabababa! mcdonald's). Keep feedin back folks. Oh and tommorrow UCC will be having a    SNOW DAY!!!!!!!!!!

(Oh and I also would like to give Sarah Eisen oral sex. I bet she has a nice 'flower,' so I should delicately put it."  Mr. V was a seriously odd fellow. He had a very strange fear of the regular lights as I might recall, replacing them with his personal lamp collection as well as a fake fire place.

However, i think this could happen to someone other than an IB2... thank you for someone sending a non-sex/heidi related feedback lately... but oh no... here it comes...   more heidi...

      I think everyone wants to give Sarah Eisen oral sex. She is hot, and by hot I mean totally sweet.   I've noticed that this blog is quickly becoming a steamy erotic forum. I think everyone is enjoying it, even if it stems from two girls who are obviously horny and deranged. However, the less said about the pringle family's mastery of the handjob the better.   It is sad about Cooper's dog. That is, unless her name was actually "Lady Cooper", in which case I'm surprised the dog didn't die of humiliation years ago.

      I think everyone wants to give Sarah Eisen oral sex.  She is hot, and by hot I mean totally sweet.   I've noticed that this blog is quickly becoming a steamy erotic forum.  I think everyone is enjoying it, even if it stems from two girls who are obviously horny and deranged.  However, the less said about the pringle family's mastery of the handjob the better.  It is sad about Cooper's dog.  That is, unless her name was actually "Lady Cooper", in which case I'm surprised the dog didn't die of humiliation years ago.  Honestly, it sounds like some sort of leg razor or woman's baseball bat.  In other news, I smoked part of a cigarette the other day.

       feedback  has now taken over the site... and my life   anonymous tipster writes:  "Unfortunately, owing to circumstances beyond my control, I can't identify myself, however I do have important information for Horkins.  On the subject of the identity of Heidi, the secretive and almost ridiculously horny alleged Victoria's Secret model, I had an epiphany when reading her most recent feedback to the site.  My attention was caught by the innocent and inconspicuous "tee hee" that concluded her message. It was strange because instead of the usual and I admit, much-anticipated "byeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" that we've come to expect from Heidi, she elected to throw a new ending in.   Upon further reflection, it occurred to me like a thunderclap, that the ending in question is characteristic of one John Spence, whom I know often utilizes the phrase.  Therefore, I urge you Horkins, to seek Spence out and confront him with this information. It may disapoint some readers to see Heidi's frisky and provocative messages come to an end, but I feel that your readers have a right to the truth.  Watching your back, as always, Anonymous"  this is some mystery novel shit! could it be spence? who is the mysterious "Anonymous"? Will his "urge" be fulfilled? Will spence be confronted? Will we ever find out what S.B. stands for??? find out next time on MYSTERY FEEDBACK THEATRE

Always good to hear from Adam Louis, the guy who got fed up of UCC and did what we all have thought of doing at least once, made like Travis Green and left. I salute you sir! Now write me a bluepage article about u leaving! I still say that would be the issue of the year! But truth be told, that pic of our dear old friend John "wanna see my wang" Pezim, the king of leaving Mirk's math class at 3:15 every day of Grade 8, reminded more of guys who dropped out further back like Raichyk, Matt Segal, Chris Waugh (who is ALSO on that site...), etc. etc. etc.  "Allow me to reintroduce myself my name is HOV, H to the O-V, I used to move snowflakes by tha O-Z I guess even back then you could call me, CEO of tha R-O-C" - Jay-Z, THe Black Album

Then quit again and give it to me.  Anyways I don't have much else to say, other than I had a fun time last nite at the McCain residence, some baited out convos with the man behind the company that brought u SUPERFRIES and one delicious pizza at Marche.

      I think it's time I throw myself to the dogs.... every other time I have released any writing I have been criticized en masse... So therefore I put up my shittly little sonnet to you all.... Be kind   The Chili Grandeur   Shadows slowly stretch themselves onto stage. Four different instruments are combined, Creating unique bliss no one else could find. Four different men who never show rage. Slithery licks are alive in the night; Melody has found the way to their heart. The mortality of a friend in part, Is why I hear them on this summer night.  Their days as miscreants are done for good; Embracing the life they took for granted. Their love of life cannot be misunderstood Who knew that the group we love today, started With pain.  Sublimely syncopated noise, The cure of everything that destroys.  Just to let u all know... I hate sonnets... With a passion! But had to write one for english and what's good enough for english is good enough for you guys (well probably not but whatever) Maybe Spence could rip this thing up to pieces. It would be an honour to be ripped by a literary genius such as Spence.  "I saw your crime, dying to get high..." Red Hot Chili Peppers - Universally Speaking  God I'm dying I'm not gonna be able to keep this up for long! Feb 7 is waaaaaaay tooooo long! Horkins I'm gonna come for that "thing" I gave u soon!!!! MUAHAHA LOL  Ciao mateys

      I like coming up with gimmicky sorts of stuff on the blog from time to time. I propose a new sort of list thing. No ratings out of klons or anything but merely a collaboration of our brilliant minds. So here it is (geeze i hope this catches on): You know you're in IB2 when...  I'll start you boys off with 3 1. You have blisters on your genitals 2. You break out that NES. Not Super Nintendo, the original baby. 3. Your mother/father/both parents/entire family, friends, house advisors give you the alcohol or drug talk.  God there are so many more but you guys are smart. Like lemurs. So prat some of your own. Big ups.

      Dear Griff,       I am sincerely appologetic for referring to you as unprofessional. It was clearly not unprofessional to merely state the fact that Morrision and Dylan did drugs from time to time. I don't know what I was thinking and don't even remember posting it. It might have been in that haze that I like to call "Christmas Break." Sometimes we just say stuff on the blog just to fill space. It was no means a comment on your character, for any teacher who would post on a student blog is clearly sweet and awesome. So I'm sorry and retract the previous comment.  Sincerely,  Your Mowbrayian homeboy - - prat-a-tat-tat - -

      I seem to have been once again the victim of a great post being deleted by blogger, or rather my forgetting to press "post" after writing it.   My trip to Barbados was awesome, two weeks of lying on the beach, partying, lying on the beach, chillin sailboat rides and lying on the beach. If you haven't seen it yet, I do have blond hair now, thanks to the wonderful people behind Sun-In. Great product, really. If not for Will Dick's new shorter hair, AND beard (!!!) and JF "if we win three periods, then logically, we will win the game" Boucher's own blondness it might just be the craaaziest over the break change anyone made. So I'm lookin all nice and tanned, and I can't wait to chill and party with all my homies from the T-Dot again. Holler! Spence, I love the play, where the fuck do you get these ideas? I thought your character was based on me for a while, but I don't have a dog named scraps...  On a final note, I got a 90 on my systems exam! Man... nine-fuckin-zero. HOLY SHIT! That's a 7, in my worst subject. This brings my mark up to 5+! Unfortunately it was really the only pleasant surprise today. Geo was basically what I could have expected, some nice marks and some not so nice marks, overall I ended up with 80, a solid way to round off an above average term for me. And math I ended up with a 79... which pretty much squashed all hopes of getting a 7, even though thats a solid 6 on our exam mark band... hopefully English will pull through, I fucking want a 7... just one, so i can be all like, yeah... I got a 7. To round off the shit-factor, Vanditz has not handed in ANY of his labs, and he has a 6, a higher mark than me, who has all my labs in. WHAT THE FUCK!? Dear Badass Dr. Hamr, I like you, but this is bullshit.   I also checked grads04... I apparently missed some fun-looking shit... man there needs to be a party this week!  PEACE OUT!

       a double feedback! from the same guy!    c.westman@utoronto.ca  "Why do you still use the name "Flounder"? And is it a reference to The Little Mermaid? The red-haired girl was hot.  Didn't you also find the fact that her lower body was made of fish just a little bit too convenient?  I smell a metaphor -- literally."  No shit man, the turrets on trident's castle look like wangs! The movie is full of that stuff... And no Curtis, it doesn't come from The Little Mermaid, although I thought it did. This nickname stems from way back at the beginning of IB1 when Bateman was in the habit of giving people crazy nicknames like "Cameron", "Rook", and "Pinto" all of which he gave to Cowie. My nickname was "Flounder" which he took from the movie Animal House, which I actually have never seen. It stuck for a little while and then faded out. It just so happened that when FOL started to become a group blog and be really popular that I changed the name from "horkypoo's website" to "flounder online", and as a result my screen name on the blog has always been flounder. wow, little known fact!   curtis writes again...  "Also, why did you use that particular year-book photo to demonstrate typical UCC boys?  Does it arouse you to know that their hands are in their pants? I think it was cold that day.  I hope you like asparagus!"  I hate asparagus. but seriously just take a look at the look on some of their faces. Like higgins, man that kid looks disturbed. And look at finkelstein and just be like "that kid was head steward... wow." It all just shows what a great house McHugh's really is. Q-UNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!

      Well seeing as I'm stuck at home sick, and really, really, really bored. I thought I'd enlighten you all with my Oscar picks (for all categories, oh baby)...   Best Picture   Lord of The Rings: Return of The King Lost in Translation Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World Mystic River Seabiscuit    should win : Lord of The Rings. Aside from it being the only one I saw (technically I saw half of Seabiscuit on a plane and thought it was boring) it should win this award for the whole trilogy. When you put those three movies together it's a piece of movie history. As long as the academy doesn't once again throw it away to the big forgettable tearfest drama (ie, Mystic River) then LOTR will be able to clean up and win for all those great sci-fi/fantasy movies that should have won (cough STARWARS...)   will win:  Lord of The Rings... see above.   was robbed:  Finding Nemo. Great movie, made a bunch of money, snubbed cause it was animated. Pirates of the Caribbean too. Fuck Cold Mountain, it probably sucked... And Old School, the greatest movie of our time.   Best Actor   Johnny Depp - PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL Ben Kingsley - HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG Jude Law - COLD MOUNTAIN Bill Murray - LOST IN TRANSLATION Sean Penn - MYSTIC RIVER    should win : Johnny Depp. Pirates was sick movie. Johnny Depp made it sick almost singlehandedly. You gotta give props when a dude can make a frickin PIRATE look this awesome. He's almost as awesome as a ninja.   will win:  If they're cool, Bill Murray. Bill Murray is the coolest guy ever. Although he was probably better in Caddyshack, or even Rushmore, odds are he won't be nominated again so now is the time. If they're gonna be stupid again then Sean Penn (I Am Sam was the worst movie ever made).   was robbed:  Elijah Wood. Does nobody else think that he holds LOTR together as Frodo? Among all the tough guys like Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn he plays the gentler, more self aware Frodo (a character you can actually relate to) perfectly. Also my boy Luke Wilson for Old School.   Best Actress   Keisha Castle-Hughes -WHALE RIDER Diane Keaton - SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE Samantha Morton - IN AMERICA Charlize Theron - MONSTER Naomi Watts - 21 GRAMS    should win:   I just think it would be cool if the 13 year old girl wins for Whale Rider...   will win:  but it's pretty much a sure bet that the academy will give it (for the 3rd year in a row, remember Halle Berry, Nicole Kidman) to the hot chick wearing makeup and a fake nose to make her look ugly, Charlize Theron.   was robbed:  Hilary Duff in the Lizzie McGuire movie... i dunno why... just... yeah...   Best Supporting Actor   Alec Baldwin - THE COOLER Benicio Del Toro - 21 GRAMS Djimon Hounsou - IN AMERICA Tim Robbins - MYSTIC RIVER Ken Watanabe - THE LAST SAMURAI    should win:  this year's nominees look like team ethnic. you got a latino guy (who is a mad ill actor, already won for Traffic tho), a huge black guy (shouldve been nommed for Amistad), a japanese guy (crazy samurai movie actor), amd two white guys one of which should win. Alec Baldwin.   will win:  Tim Robbins.   was robbed:  Sean Astin. Sam was huge in the third LOTR movie and he had a really powerful performance. Also Will Ferrell for Old School, which was lovely.   Best Supporting Actress   Shohreh Aghdashloo - HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG Patricia Clarkson - PIECES OF APRIL Marcia Gay Harden - MYSTIC RIVER Holly Hunter - THIRTEEN Rene Zellweger - COLD MOUNTAIN    should win:  The Iranian chick from the house movie... yeah the first one.   will win:  Renee Zellweger, why is she a high profile actress????   was robbed:  no beef here...   Best Director   Fernando Meirelles-CITY OF GOD Peter Jackson-THE LORD OF THE RINGS Sofia Coppola-LOST IN TRANSLATION Peter Weir-MASTER AND COMMANDER Clint Eastwood-MYSTIC RIVER    should win:  Fernando! City of God is an ill movie I'm gonna go see right now... no really its about the ghettos and all the hard stuff that happens in Rio... very street.   will win:  there are a lot of the academy's favourite names here but Peter Jackson will definitely get his greasy hobbit hands on this statue.   was robbed:  Todd Phillips for Old School... genius   Animated Feature Film   BROTHER BEAR FINDING NEMO THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE    should win : Finding Nemo. As cowie said "it was cute", in my own words "it was fuckin awesome!"   will win : Probably Finding Nemo. If they're gonna be weird about it, it might go to that french one... the triplets... weird.   was robbed : was there a pokemon movie this year???   Best Original Song   "Belleville Rendez-vous" - THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE "Into the West" - THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow" - A MIGHTY WIND "Scarlet Tide" - COLD MOUNTAIN "You Will Be My Ain True Love" - COLD MOUNTAIN    should win : none of them. they all suck.   will win : the enya song from LOTR... i dont care. and don't they mean "one" true love... weird   was robbed : when eminem won last year I thought the academy had come a long way from randy newman and phil collins but this just proves we're back in the land of shitty music made for movies, here is a list of better nominees.  Shake Ya Tailfeather - BAD BOYS II  that is all.   Visual Effects   THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL    should win:  LOTR  will win:  LOTR, did the other movies even have special effects?  was robbed:  The Matrix sequels, even tho they were shitty, they had awesome special effects.  ... wow I lied, all the other categories are boring. So there you have it folks. Enjoy. Watch me be right this sunday.

"fuck rapand fuck chua and fuck john spence/ i'll crush every pound in your body into six pence/ alrite spence i know you can write it, but when u try to recite it it sounds way over-hyped kid/ and chua dont think your getting off without a beating/ i drank a 40 and fucked your mom at my last AA meeting/ the chink chick just couldnt handle the big dick so her ribs split and she got sick right after my dick spit/ and john spence you better keep an eye on your sis/ cause if i cant find you,then im gonna slit that sluts wrist/ i take it serious whenever faggots wanna spit raps at my ass/ but spence is getting fucked harder then [censored] / rap idols a joke and chua already tried to battle on the corner of frybrook/ but he got took with one look and ended up spitting my hook/ fuck chua and his raps are coming sweet and sour/ i'll catch him delivering food and beat him for half an hour/ hop in the shower and think about who im gonna fuck later/ grab spences mom and turn that ass into a six foot deep crater/ chuas going back to hong kong and i'll be blazing the chron bong thanking god that hes long gone/ i've got no time for bitches who can write but not flow/ whens!  the last time spence or chua fucked a hoe?/ "  See this looks like booth's style and all but he has posting priveleges, why would he send it as feedback? So i don't know if it's actually booth. All in all spence and chua just got murdered. I had to censor out a certain line cause it named certain people not involved in the battle and might have hurt some feelings. peace

      Dear Librarian,  Where have you gone? Are you too afraid to continue this battle or what? If you're reading this, it's an official challenge to start this battle up again. PS. Booth wants to know who you are, he's got the chinstrap back now.  Yours Truly, Horkypoo

      it's that time again...  feedback time!!!!!    anonymous writes  "Those fuckers who stole our shoes/boots from Reismans will DIE! Damn random grade eleven girls, this is why they get a bad rep. because they do stupid ass shizznat like this, and no grade 12 girl will trust them PEACE"  I concur. Who steals shoes? That is just not right. How do you expect someone to get home without shoes? Not cool random girls. Not cool at all. This only proves the age old addage "IB1s and their friends are sketchy and they ruin our parties" I will hunt down the shoe stealers to the end of the earth... or at least silently curse them from the UCC library.   probably spence writes...  "badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger badger MUSHROOM MUSHROOM!  see you in systems class-BLAZED!"  Spence man, you have posting priveleges... stop clogging the feedback with your badger crap, if you don't know what he's talking about, click the badger link to your right.

      I am sick, my throat feels like shit my nose is blocked up and I'm so exhausted... being sick sucks. But anyways, last night we had our musical cast steaknite that quickly became chicken-night after we were booted from the keg (who wants to wait 2.5 hours for good steak and good friends anyways?) so we went to Swiss Chalet, which was lovely. And I found myself wondering, what colour are this waitress's underpants. Y'know odds are they're just your basic white cotton underpants but i dunno, maybe they're silk... maybe it's a thong... maybe it's something really cool i dont know about.  a final quote from busta "i hope you neva rest in peace... muthafucka"   PS my french oral interview was awesome

      Ah, WAC what a glorious day.  Although I have to wake up and battle this hack chua.  at least it's the final round...  i gotta spit this rhyme and i cant take too long because im sending your ass back to hong kong you cant rap chink, your ship's about to sink youre about to get fucked harder than the rape of nanking youre just loaded with rice and chowmein and im rolling in ice and cocaine and if you call my blow low take a bump instead of gettin humped in the rump and fuckin clay aiken's rakin' more bacon than your chinese ass'll ever be makin' and there's no mistakin that im the greatest sensation to hit the nation so go back to your texts and mathematical tricks and i'll go back to havin' sex with multiple chicks who cares if your name's MC when you can't reach the mike cuz you're four foot three and your dick's so small you need glasses to pee you can have your bitch kahlua ill drain a 40 of JB im so lyrically skilled that it kills, verbally armed to the hilt and i get more pussy than wilt the motherfuckin stilt so itll be no surprise when all you guys' wives drive by when i'm kickin it live with more fuckin cash than Bonnie and Clyde so i suggest you retire  cuz anything you say is like gas on a fire get on your knees you chinese disease show some repentence I'll burn all that you earn and you won't be getting one cent "hello, customs and immigration?

Btw, I saw an excellent movie today:  Mulholland Drive.  It's insanely trippy.  All the time you're just like, "whaaaat?"  and there are two hot lesbian scenes (woah).

      Yo, I saw the closing show of Hamlet last night and it was awesome. This show is so professional, if it weren't for the audience full of retarded kids (aka: us) cracking up whenever they say "cock". But anyways I've been getting a lot of feedback lately about my friend Cowie, and out of courtesy I haven't been posting it but finally this guy has convinced me to release this stuff... so here goes.   feeeeedback    cowie-hater writes...  "Yo. Post my cowie-bashing stuff. i want the world to know why the fuck he is fucking himslef over like this"  you know what man... I somewhat agree with you. I will post your other messages and perhaps Cow-dog will use his posting priveleges to respond.   cowie-hater also has written...  "cowie is retarded." -Feb. 15  "Yo horkins, Since cowie is your friend, tell him to GET ON IT FAST! I think you know what I mean" -Feb. 10  "you forgot the part in the play about Nikki where Cowie's standing around doing nothing" -Feb. 9  there you go folks... make what you will. Cowie is a good guy, u shouldn't be so hard on him.

      so now that I'm actually awake (wow, its 5 PM...) I'll say something about Hockey Night...  First off the House Hockey All Star Game kicked shit off at 3. The incredibly stacked North Team of Mow, McQ's (the q-unit), Brem, Jackson's, and Wedd's demolished the pitiful South squad of Howard's, Scadding's, Seaton's, Martland's and Orr's with a final score of 13-2 or something crazy like that. I racked up 2 insane points, 1 asisst to canella and 1 amazing goal asissted right into my shoulder from Pratscott. Then we all left and came back several hours later for the UCC/SAC game in which PRATTTT-ash (aka jeff morash) did play (idiot...). UCC performed the equivalent of an atomic wedgie to SAC scoring 4 unanswered goals in the shut out of the year. The game ended with the biggest fight I have ever seen at a UCC hockey game. As JF Boucher put it "They hate us, we hate them. It's all good." After stuffing the whole team into the penalty box they decided not to play the last 2.2 seconds and the UCC Blues were declared victorious. As for the afterparty... it was at some sketchy bar which I didn't go to so I'll let someone else handle that. I chilled at Jrobs's house for a bit, on the verge of passing out (this is why i dont regret so much not going to the "afterparty"...) my tiredness was so overcoming that when I got home i just passed out in my bed.  But anyways, hockey night at Ricoh was not as good as the ACC but still a great time had by all.  The end

      YO! Booth you are the chrons my friend. You rip it hardcore even when we think you aren't rapping. I'm scared for rap idol. You know who else is a crazy rapper and I didn't even know it (he's an ill poet, he can flow it) is Sameer! He was kickin it freestyle like no other in the car with me and farouk on our way back from our tasty McQ's wing nite (WINGS! sooooo delicious...) after he left I kicked a little freestyle for farouk cause i didn't want to show my skillz to sameer... the competition. Rap Idol is gonna be crazy.  Even better than rap idol is tommorrow's hockey night festivities. House All Stars tommorrow at 3:00 BE THERE! I'm playing! UCC is gonna demolish SAC! I predict it to be a 20-1 blowout with AK scoring like ten goals, Pratash with 2, Boucher with 3, Belanger with 1, Rouleau with 1, Hudson with 1, Lowman with 1, and Ponayyy with 1. The SAC goal will be scored by some guy named "Jimmy Joe Bob Jim Ass Smith" cause Mills is too busy checking out this insanely hot chick in the front row who is flashing him and holding up a sign thats like "I love Mark Mills". But then coach Mckell is like "are we playing to win or for some floozy in the stands, hey what has two thumbs and likes blowjobs? THIS GUY!" and points to himself. Then they do a nice breakout and he's like "BREAK IT OUT! nice breakout!!!" but thats beside the point. The point is that the North All Stars are the illest ever and we will run tings at Hockey Night. And that Hockey Nite will be the shit so everyone reading right now will check to see that no one crept into their room last nite and stole their ticket or they are busy buying one right now on TICKETMASTER.CA!!!!! NOW!   HOCKEY NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!

      Well Im just chilling in the Librbary supposed to be doing my History Internal Assesment and Im a little board right now so I thought that I would complete a small post.  Yes Chris I would concur that this afternoon's festivities were awesome, even more awesomer than Superman Batman Spiderman, and Captain Planet put together, but not Boba Fett. No matter how sure I am I never bet the Fett man. Wow! What was that Liberachi? A rhyme? Perhaps you can think of this rhyme when you're rapping instead of rhyming sore-kins with Horkins and shit like that. Anyway I have a poem written about this microwave/bagel molester Liberachi.....  His mom rises him in the morn, To find last evening's porn. What the heck is this! Human's and Animal's don't mix! This stuff is supposed to be for hicks!  Anyway this Liberachi 'cat' fucking sucks man, Horkins has pumeled him into submission, now let us never utter his amount of crapiness ever again.....

      oh baby... I had the pleasure of participating in yet another bss fundraising spirit week deal. This time, instead of a battle of the decades, it was the Mr. Pretty Boy Pageant. George Lace and myself were repping Grade 7 (holler!) aka the green team aka the winners. We were up against Bateman (grade 9), Goose (10), Barter (11), and Boucher and some random black dude (12). We had to dance and answer questions and pose and stuff but the real shinging moment was the talent competition. I busted the illest rap you've never heard, and the crowd went wild... the next eminem right here man, trust. And George removed his undies without taking off his pants! At the end they said there weren't any winners but everyone knew that GRADE 7 ran tings. I'm always available if u girls need a guy for these things to let y'all know.

It's over, I'm the winner, you're wack, the end. And oh by the way, you spelled yesterday wrong (yesTARDay) , but then again its cause ur just reTARDed.

      this blog is turning into a bad spoof of 8 Mile.  Who is this random librarian dude?  He appeared out of nowhere with that shabby booth rap and now he is challenging horkins to some sort of hip hop duel.  I personally think that the librarian has shown some potential in his recent rhymes, perhaps outdoing the esteemed horkypoo on the last exchange.  But what do I know?  If it wasn't for booth's car I'd never listen to rap.  On another note, Bishy and I are in an SCS play.  We play twentysomething pseudobohemians living in Paris.  I am Louis, as in Louis Vuitton (I am not making this up) and Bishop is "Pierre".  He's got the HIV.  Also, Bish and Irwin and I went on a shopping excursion in Pete's s6 during theatre.  First we hit up Goodwill and bought Peter a flouncy dress and matching visors.  Then it was off to Shopper's Drug Mart for some adult diapers.  At first we couldn't decide between getting full-on adult diapers or the patterned infant diapers.  We were surprised that they have a line-up of diapers for kids above the age of 6 and that the median waistline for the adult diaper buying demographic is about 55 inches.  Our Life Brand "Small"  Super Absorband briefs (14 pack) was intended for adults with a  minimum  waistline of 34 inches.  What about the incontinent thin people!!??  While we were there Peter bought some condoms.  He now has more condoms in his wallet than there are in the entire state of Delaware.  Bishop bought a four-legged cane and some gum.  I must go now because it time to mate on my planet.

      Man JJ-McSnugz owns that free-style competition. This Liberachi guy fucking sucks man. Yo my rap will leave you sore-kins, Horkins. What the fuck was that!? I mean if you're going to insult the guy don't make up words. Thats just very very sad man. I even bet you spent about a day on that rap and Flounder shut it down in about 5 minutes so basically you wasted your valuable time which you could have spent downloading your weird asian porn or something like that, maybe farm animals are your thing, I don't know you'll just have to sort it out at a later. But in the future please refrain from using the blog as a forum for crapiness, which is you. By the way, who the hell calls themself Liberachi? Liberachi was a gay piano player man.     In other news, Horkins the Grammy Awards are not the BET Awards, I mean you have 2 white people there, and they're ONE band, and "The Scientist" was released in 2002...... But a valiant effort for a year when most music sucked...

"i think you just proved what everyone knows but let me lay it down with this lyrical flow: your rhymes are all flat u ain't got no gat you sound like a wigger who is pasty and fat. you have no originality if "fifty" heard u there'd be a fatality cuz you just recycle your shit from booth and t-bit and you cough on a joint even when it aint lit. you attack me with what? go ahead, "rape a slut" you get less pussy than jabba the hut! so stop pretending and put an ending to what you knew would be your waterloo and save your prayers for when you fall down the stairs and people laugh off their asses because nobody wants to get your damn glasses and that, horkypoo, is why im #1 so consider this battle over and done"  ahem...  allow me to rip hardcore on this fuckin cracka even tho i dont usually mess wit gay rappas u think ur shit is so hot and this battle is finished but its not even close, i leave ur ass diminished sayin i recycle rhymes, well urs are just trash ill stab you wit a knife an leave 12 inch gash comparin me to star wars, sayin shit about fitty let me remind u, jabba had that chick six titties i'll gat ur ass and put it in a garbage can thats one less Another Man's Garbage fan just to be in his click i bet u'd suck booth's dick fuckin faggot, listen to some jedi mind trick ill ice you to the tune of "Blood Runs Cold" a song u never heard of cause ur 40 years old i walk down frybrook leave the whole place shook ur hidin in your fuckin office readin history books like "oh im a say his shit is like waterloo" u just mad cause my flow is so much hotter than you and everyone wants these glasses cause they so iced out this supermarket is now closed so it's time i priced out let's see i got this librarian on sale after everybody heard this Zero dollars, cause your shit is so worthless   more librarian rap writes...  "Well, I'm glad I got that angry rap off my chest. Now I an focus on a pure love rap for my fantasy stellar superstar: adam booth.  check it real slow: sometimes in the library it can get kinda dark and scary and i feel so scared and alone but then i see his face  and his pseudo-whiteboy thug grace it creates a wet spot in my underpants ohhhh yeah... and i tell you now its the truth my love belongs to adam booth i touch myself inapprorpiately and then return to reality and start to convulse violently because i dont have the man with chinstraps and timberlands to make love to me and call me his one and only! oh baybeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! so im writing this rhyme for you and i hope that you hear it sometime because my biological clock is ticking and my victoria's secret thong is sticking  up my ass crack! and i also have really bad razor burn around my genitals but it dont matter 'cause im barren..."

      Once again it seems that the Grammy Awards have fucked up big time. I give them mad props for giving the album of the year to OutKast, they deserve it big time but they fucked up pretty much everything else (fifty goes home empty handed???) so I've left it up to myself to right the wrongs with...   FOL Presents The "Real" Grammy Awards    Album Of The Year   Get Rich or Die Tryin' - 50 Cent   Chocolate Factory - R. Kelly   The Black Album - Jay-Z   A Rush of Blood To The Head - ColdPlay   Speakerboxxx/The Love Below - OutKast   Of course the winner of this category is  50 Cent . The biggest selling album of 2003 is also the best. Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is a great concept album but it can't touch the intensity of 50's beyond gangster debut. RKelly had the comeback of the century with Chocolate Factory and deserves to be recognised. And none of this blueprint 2 shit, The Black Album is Jay's best album since Reasonable Doubt and it did come out in 03. And Coldplay is just an ill band.   Record Of The Year   Get Low - Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz   The Scientist - ColdPlay   Hey Ya! - OutKast   In Da Club - 50 Cent   Cadillac On 22's - David Banner   It goes to  Hey Ya!  but all these songs are equally more deserving than Clocks (which is such a shitty song compared to The Scientist). Get Low was easily the biggest song of the summer so it deserves to be up there. Lose Yourself, not nominated cause it is from LAST YEAR...   Best New Artist   50 Cent   Chingy   Bone Crusher   Lil Jon and The East Side Boyz   Sean Paul   Fuck Evanescence.  50  takes it easily, although all these dudes made a killer debut. Chingy put STL on the map, again, with Right Thurr and Holidae Inn back to back hits. Bone Crusher's Never Scared was one of the biggest hits of the year. Lil Jon made Krunk music a nation sweeping phenomenon, as did Sean Paul with Dancehall.   Best Rap Collaboration   Shake Ya Tailfeather - Nelly, PDiddy and Murphy Lee   Beautiful - Snoop Dogg feat Pharrell   Holidae Inn - Chingy feat Snoop and Ludacris   What Happened To That Boy? - The Clipse feat Baby   Magic Stick - Lil Kim feat 50 cent   It goes to  Snoop  but Nelly and co. are equally as deserving. The other ones are all really great but the top two are the ones that deserve to win.  And those are all the categories I care about... THE END

       the biggest feedback hit ever...    UCC Rap writes...  "I'm a spoiled, rich Jew, But I'm blacker than you, And I'd probably be scared If Auwal came near muh crew!  Muh ghetto's Forest Hill, It pays the bills When muh daddy's suing shills And healing ills, son!  So when you's rollin' down To FH village town, And you see muh mommy's beige Benz Is shaking ends, You bettuh not come a knockin', 'Cause the T-Unit's rockin'; Oh maybe just forgot to take his medicine, Uh!"  Teddy G is in tha house... (I think that's who "t-unit" is supposed to be) Once again may I reiterate that UCC RAP IDOL is touchin down in your town sometime soon. So grab ya pencils and scrap paper and get ready cause when this shit drops... run for cover.   one of many girls writes...  "One time I thought about hooking up with booth. Then I did! BLEAUHJ!"  Just one more reminder that dreams do come true so be careful what u wish for. But seriously, this could be one of hundreds of girls and that's if they're telling the truth! I'll give a hundred props to whoever can tell me the real pronunciation of "BLEAUHJ"... NEXT!   Get Off The Road writes...  "You boys should spend less time smoking dope on frybrook and more time reading quietly in the library. Also, I want to hook up with Adam Booth. When I saw him today, I just laid down this freestyle to the chill beats i was playin in my camry:  yo yo yo yo booth your jacket its big enough for two yo yo you and ms blue yo i like the fur lining its got me pining for you yo jus' you and ms blue"  I got 4 things to say to this letter: 1)frybrook is mad illz 2)that rap sucked hard (yo!) 3) so do u want to hook up with booth or do u want booth to hook up with the librarian at our school, or SOMETHING ELSE (tsssss) either way ur messed up... holla back 4)ur camry is a rice rocket next caller...   Booth-hater writes...  "Tell this booth guy to quit stealing my gig!"  Thank you David Peppal... jus playin man, but seriously booth invented the game so dont be a playahata just cause the SLIME of the earth hooked up with ur sister. Moving on...   Rapping Librarian writes...  "I like rap. I think this site should publish freestyles submitted by, say, librarians. that would be cool. yeah."  I also enjoy rap. But no, no it would not. Feel free to submit a freestyle tho... u can make it a battle and I'll battle you back!   SB writes...  "I like it when a guy gives me SB on, you know, the other side?  Tuchuslingus mean anything to you? You should try it on your gf, horkypoo."  Yeah that sounds great and all but I think I'll pass... And also this poor miseducated soul is not aware of the fact that I am sans-girlfriend... that's right ladies u can have all this plus a free hotplate! ONLY IF U CALL NOW! I'm the Bachelor, kinda like Bob from the Bachelorette when he was more funny and not so made over...    Amateur Play Write writes...  "Nikki's Yoga Mat Scene  Reisman dangling Nikki's yoga mat over a ledge. Bishop, Bienstock, Walsh and Spence sit at the table.  Bishop: Nikki, grab your fuckin' bitch mat!  Spence and Walsh laugh histerically  Bishop: You kneel like a dog on that mat!  Spence and Walsh laugh uncontrollably  Bishop opens a beer  Steam pours out of Nikki's ears and mouth  end scene"  I think this is an attempt at a "six line", a form of play only the greatest playwrites of our time (aka ME) have written effectively. Despite this being only two lines it is nevertheless hilarious, the part where Walsh and Spence laugh uncontrollably almost had me typing LOL... almost. I give it 3.5 Klons out of 5.  And that's our show! Seven feedbacks in one post! I have to write my UofT application! AAAAH!

       feedbaxk    Jess and Kath be writin...  "G'day everyone... this is Katherine and Jess gossiping about French SB. It's good. Very, very good (apparently). There's a grade wide contest officially launched today to devirginize Alex Hill. Prize: You get to run down the halls yelling "I TOOK ALEX HILL'S VIRGINITY". Second prize goes to devirginizing Ramy Behman. Warning: if you are not the Virgin Mary (no, literally, as in actually the Virgin Mary, robes and all) then your chances are slim to none. Warning girls: he may make you preggers without actually having sex with you. Strange. Prize: Sitting at God's right hand. Third prize goes to anyone who can honestly say that they haven't hooked up with or thought about hooking up with Booth. Prize: this concept is foreign to us, we don't understand what we mean. NOT hook up with Booth? Does that happen??  Keep us updated!  We do not appreciate Bishop volunteering his obviously misguided opinion about emotional girls. Just because we all want to tap your 18 year old father doesnt mean that were over-emotional. Quite opposite actually: wed bang him without looking back! (Hi, Bishs mom!!!). Anyway, for those of us who are semi-emotionally stable (thats Jess, not Kath the basket-case), a stance isbeing taken. And you are getting beat up by Rouleau every day. VARSITY SQUASH VERSUS VARSITY HOCKEY. We know who were cheering for. (Actually the squash boys are pretty hotnot exactly butch though- Hi Brooker!) Peace out.  -Jess and Kath"  All I can say is... I've never hooked up with booth... wow (as girls would say "awkward"...) Oh, and I don't know what contest ur talking about but Varsity Squash would so own, c'mon Ben Sinclair? It's Ben*SYNC in tha hizz-ouse! OH BABY!

Personally, I think g-unit and Fitty are overrated, U gotta go deep like Aesop Rock and Dead Prez and all these hype artist that stay on the d-lo.. Y'all should peep Jedi Mind Tricks.... they are sick!!!! Anyways thats all I have to say for tonite! Keep writing mad lyrics and keep rappin even if ur white, I support that!!!  Peaaaaaaaaaaaace  P.S. Yo Horkins.. U don't have to write anonymous, like Bone Crusher, I ain't never scared, I say whats on my mind and I'm chill with taking the beef if there is any... I ain't there to be anonymous..."  I only make you anonymous cause u dont leave ur name on the feedback form, eh? But anyways, 50 and the unit are way hype even though they got launched into the mainstream cause 50 got lucky wit "get rich.." an all that they are still keepin it gutter and thats really what its all about. Jedi Mind Trick are really good. Their rhymes show that they have a lot of lyrical skill plus they have a sick dj that provides them with some of the sickest beats in underground rap (ie blood reign, blood runs cold, trinity, etc.) I really like all that underground shit but sometimes u just gotta keep it simple and keep it KRUNK with some lil jon or somethin (put yo HOOD up!) or some luda or whatever. whoever this is... u obviously know a lot about rap and shit and i look forward to competing in RAP IDOL wit chu...  paaaaaaaayce

      I have some mad  feedback !   anonymous french rapper writes...  "Ok, I love rap and I can say that it is my favorite kind of music...But please please please, We are all white!!!!! Yes we can try and be gangsta, but lets also not forget that we are going to UCC.... I do not deny the fact that the shit might be good, and this is not hate....I respect guys like booth and bittner for their rap skills that are really hard to get!!! But what im saying is this....... We should not try and be that ghetto..cuz quite frankly...were not really.. ANyways, I guess were going to see who's the ghettoest with the Rap idol stuff at UCC, and yes i will participate even if im french lol.... But please, we are not that ghetto.... Long live to the Rap industry... And fitty is tight, but I encourage you to check out Lloyd Banks from G-Unit... Although he sounds like he has a permanent cold, he has a better flow and better lyrical skills than fitty... Anyways, I'm out! Peaaaaaaaaaaaaaace"  First of all, rap is the shit. I must say that rap and hip hop represent the greatest musical innovation of the 20th and 21st centuries. Secondly while Lloyd Banks, Fifty and the whole G-Unit click are all mad tight rappers, my personal favourite from that crew has to be Young Buck. His lyrical style is way ill and I think he has the best lines for example "I wear a holster on my shoulda like im john wayne shootin these niggas lights out like lebron james"... and yo man, being white shouldnt stop you from liking rap and trying to live out the ghetto fantsasy i still write rap in class and try to freestyle and shit. It didn't stop marshall so dont let it stop you. It's not about being "black" or "ghetto" its about rap and living the hip hop fantasy... so dont give up if u want to rap.   anonymous community service dude writes...  "There will be a community service opportunity for all interested volunteers this thursday at the - SHITFUCKTITSPUSSYCUNTBOOBSSCROTUM - MacMillan Centre. ALl those interested please e-mail me or drop by my - 13YROLDBLOWJOBSEXASSHOLEPARISHILTONXXXCUMTWAT - office.

      The superbowl was... SUPER! Aside from predicting exactly what would happen from the division finals on to the end of a "close" superbowl (yeah... so called that), I felt sad that the Panthers lost. I decided to cheer for them halfway through cause when you think about it, it was like Superbowl 36 except that the Patriots were the Rams (hottest team in the league) and the Panthers were the Pats (the underest of underdogs), except that this time the Patriots won. The halftime show sucked big time. Not only was everyone lipsyncing, except for Nelly and Justin (who basically just beatboxed anyways). They all did songs that were way old (rhythm nation???) and at the end Justin ripped off Janet's bra... wow. Way to go Justin. There was a streaker but they didnt show him. Just Teddy Bruschi's reaction like "oh my GOD". The MVP should've been David Givens at least. He was way more of a standout performer than Brady, so many great catches.  After the bowl they had the "All-Star Survivor" I might be the only one that still watches it but Survivor is a great show still. This All-Star one looks pretty ill too. Richard Hatch is being all "I'm better than everyone" and then he takes his skirt off. And they voted off Tina, the winner of Australia (!!!). But yo, if you want to know who will be a player in this game, watch out for Rob Mariano, thats right  Boston Rob . I predict that him, and Rob C. from Amazon will have an ill alliance with Amber from Australia and run tiiiings. Next to be voted off? Sue from the original... she is being a mad bitch right now... plus she drank the nasty water... ugh.  that's it for now... paaaaaayce

       feedback    anonymous drunk branksome girls writes...  "No one go and see the triplets of belleville.. i was tricked into it. Unfortunately, it wasn't the happy cartoon about three guys in belleville, ontario being bored and doing drugs that i thought it would be.. thank god we werent sober.. fuck you katherine! if you must see it.. just don't. And a sidenote: The Eugene was definately robbed last night, what a great movie that was. "  I promised booth that I would never post anything sent in by them again but I felt that this admonishment against the film that is more a crime against animation than a film deserved to be printed. Not that I've seen it, or even would consider seeing it if it were about guys doing drugs in belleville ontario (home of the belleville bulls), but The Triplets of Belleville looked like a shitty movie. I'm very glad that in the end the academy awarded what, I thought, was one of the best films of the year, Finding Nemo, with the Best Animated Feature award (a category they have yet to make a mistake in by the way, like animation? Shrek, Spirited Away, and Finding Nemo are all awesome). But then again, you girls are drunk, so why am I even writing this?   I'm just kidding ladies you know I love you...

      I love both these teams. How can I pick a winner here? It's really reallly tough to say. I'm just glad the flyers aren't in the final, I hate the flyers. But I loooooove the lightning, and I love the flames too. So let's examine the factors:  Forwards: Tampa has MVP Candidate Martin St. Louis, Calgary has MVP Candidate Jarome Iginla. Who is the better forward, hard to say. Most of Calgary's Forwards are relatively unknown or just guys with a hell of a lot of heart (Conroy, Gelinas) and one stars left over from the old Colorado team (YelleR). Tampa on the other hand has Brad Richards, Dave Andreychuck, Vincent Lecavalier, lots of great players. I still say this one is too close to call... Edge: Even  Defence: Calgary has played some SICK D with guys you've never heard of (Montador?). Tampa has some tenacious D as well with Kubina, Sydor, and co. It all comes down to who can be more effective. I can easily see Kubina stepping up to the job of trying to cover Jarome Iginla. I'm not sure the Calgary defence will be able to handle Lecavalier, Richards, and St. Louis all at once. Edge: Lightning  Goaltending: Kiiprussoff is the truth, this guy is at the top of his game right now. He is so flexible, he never takes his eyes off the puck, rarely has a bad game. Khabibulin is just as good. Both these goalies have carried their teams thus far. Kiprussoff, though, looks like he can carry his team all the way to the cup if he had to. Edge: Flames  Special Teams: This is the only pretty lopsided category. The Bolts ARE a Powerplay team. They OWN powerplay. If you take too many bad penalties against the bolts they will strike and strike hard. Their offence is that explosive. They're also the better team on the PK. Calgary is good at both PP and PK, but no match for Tampa's superior special teams. Edge: Lightning  Intangibles: The Flames have the best playoff song of the entire playoffs: "In The Dome" a rippoff of In Da Club which is so hot right now in Calgary. They have the best fans in this series, the loudest building and they're the better road team. They also have Harvey the Hound, voted best mascot in the NHL last year. Edge: Flames.  Prediction: All I can say is this, it will come down to game 7. Who is the better team? We'll find out then. I feel bad for not picking the flames all playoffs even though I think they're awesome. I said three things mid season and two of them are coming true: Calgary will be this year's dark horse team, and The Lightning will be the team to win the east if the leafs don't. The other thing was that the Leafs would win the cup... :( I hate ROENICK! But if I had to pick a team to win at this point, it would be Tampa because they'll have home ice in game 7 and they just had a game 7 at home. Otherwise I'm just gonna sit back and enjoy the greatest stanley cup final that nobody will watch.

      okay, i admit, halfway through last night's game i jumped on the calgary flames bandwagon. i mean, this team just has so much heart and willpower. they're amazing to watch. it just sucks that they were so bad last year and now they go to the cup finals when the leafs have been SO close for SO many years now. well i'm glad that the flames won. congrats to iggy, geli, conny, yeller and all the boys with their crazy nicknames.  i owe george 5 bucks.  and by the way, i'm still sticking to my mid season prediction that tampa bay will win the stanley cup.

      They announced the Team Canada roster for the World Cup. Here are my lines:  FORWARDS St. Louis - Lemieux - Iginla Heatley - Sakic - Smyth Marleau - Thornton - Doan Maltby - Yzerman - Draper Gagne - Morrow - Richards   DEFENCE Brewer - Niedermayer Blake - Foote Pronger - Jovanovski Redden - Regehr   and in goal...  1. Brodeur (he won the gold in salt lake, if he screws up early we can put in the eagle) 2. Belfour 3. Luongo  Holla!  And btw, I don't even feel like making a write up for french, it would take longer than the exam did. Easiest ever. 10 million infinity klondikes out of 5.  PEAACE

      If there was ever a needless continuation of an already ridiculously easy exam, this was it. I think everyone there can testify that all the questions were easy as HELL, even for someone with a 5 in systems. Option C, before the exam I didn't know what it was so I read the syllabus section for it ONCE and ran that option into the ground. Option C was soooo much easier than the others because it was 2 pages, and the other ones were at least 4. And the questions were like "name an endangered species..." (Giant Crayfish aka Tasmanian River Lobster!) "talk about a national park". And my personal fave "how can you identify a species you don't know?" for which "ask someone" gets you full marks.  Chillness Rating: 11.7 out of 5 klondikes

      a thought occurred to me while studying for systems paper 3... Polar Bears, the ultimate paradox: they're really cute, but they eat people.

      Continuing with the IB Final exam updates...   Systems Paper 1 and 2  A double exam, 2 papes. Paper 1 was SOOOOO easy. It's hard to imagine an exam being any easier than this. Multiple choice, 30 questions in 45 minutes and most of these questions are like "what would happen if we used less gas?" Wow. Thanks IB! Real hard exam. Paper 2 was a little harder. You had to actually write out your answer, but the questions were still like.  "What is this:   [5 marks]"  and you get 10 lines to say "its a desert, retard!"  chillness factor:  10 out of 5 klons  ... and now for a shameless plug: Yo. I'm in a play. It's on Friday at BSS at like 7:30 (? i think) but still be there. It's good. It's FREE. You'll thank me later.  peace

      It's been a long time coming but your favourite website is back in action. I took a little break from blogging after tripod deleted the blog but now that Blogger went and got some kind of extreme makeover with comments and crazy new templates I couldn't resist. As if I had better things to do during exams. Anyways, I would like to publicly laugh at Rouleau's attempt to replace FOL with some kind of  urlLink TDot2004  blog... hahaha. I'm just kidding man you know I love you. Anyways so what's been happening in this extended abscence from the internet I've had. Well, we had the musical, that was ill, I won Premier at OMP, which was also ill, and then I rapped in assembly and got a standing ovation, the illness continues. And now on with the show.  And just when the final IB exams thought they were safe...   IB Final Exam Marathon Update!   that's right, it's that time of year again.   English Paper 1  This one was a dry run for most of us. I know I got in there and basically stared at the blank IB stationery in front of me and this crazy poem about some kids planting a tree and I was just like... "what the f-" for about fifteen minutes. My brain slowly got readjusted to critical thinking (it's been a LONG third term) and got into the rhythm of writing an essay and in the end I got a solid essay out somehow. After that initial uneasiness though it was all downhill. Easy exam.  chillness factor : 4.5 klons out of 5   Math Studies Paper 1  WhOA STUDIES! This one was pretty easy. I mean it could've been a LOT easier. It seemed the IB Math people decided that they didn't like studies anymore and they put all the hardest studies topics on it and none of the easy ones... come on, you call that a LOGIC question? I didn't tear it up as much as I thought I would, but in the end it was still torn up.  chillness factor : 4 klons out of 5   Math Studies Paper 2  WhOoOoOA STUDIES! Okay so we all know Paper 2 is the hard one. And this held true. It was harder than Paper One but somehow I managed to answer the questions adequately. I have to admit there were some questions that I just found way too hard and probably didn't do so hot on, but the majority were cake. Chocolate cake. Especially the Stats option... wow. And I hate stats.  chillness factor : 3.2 klons out of 5   English Paper 2  This one was the one I was most worried about. With all that memorising poems and quoting without the poem in front of you stuff... I had a good question in mind and when it wasn't there I was like "F$%@" but then I found one that actually applied to ALL the poems I studied. I used 6 different ones with quotes. It was a solid essay. holler.  chillness factor : 4.2 klons out of 5  don't you love blogging? cause i do. AND NOW THERE'S COMMENTS... none of that "feedback system" stuff with my email. but don't abuse it or i take it away.  it's good to be back. Spence, Bish, Bateman, all you guys on that list that I forgot had priveleges: POST! peace

      Hart- St. Louis, i called it. Vezina- Brodeur, bullshit man, shouldve gone to Luongo... Norris- Niedermayer, called it. Calder- Raycroft, called that one too. Selke- Draper, he deserves it but i wouldve rather seen McCauley win. Lady Byng- Richards, called this one. Jack Adams- Tortorella, he was a good coach, i like "safe is death", but Ron Wilson deserves this one, he really turned that sharks team around.  so i was 4/7, overall a very predictable awards show.

      who called it? who called it? i called it mid season.  "the leafs will win the stanley cup. but if they don't it will be the tampa bay lightning." -me circa a couple months ago, cowie will confirm.  Dave Andreychuck finally finds Stanley after 22 years. Way to go Dave. Lukowich will get his name on the cup this time. Richards finally outshines his old buddy vinny, who might have managed to permanently move out of tortorella's doghouse if he had scored on that breakaway (!!) Mighty Mouse Martin St Louis might remember big number 4 steve mckell from the UVM days... but he's thinkin more about havin a HART these days.  Best final in years, by far. Tampa deserves it. Calgary gave it their all too and they deserve much respect. Jarome is kickin himself for touching that trophy now...   Thank you NHL for another great year, let's hope the CBA guys can just realise that we NEED HOCKEY NEXT YEAR and just solve this mess.  It's a wrap

      I WAS WRONG!  Man Game 7 will be totally awesome, and by that I mean totally sweet. Will Dave Andreychuck finally win the cup after 22 years? Will the "canada's team" aka (some backwater oiltown's team hyped to death by the canadian media) take the cup "home" (aka to the flat brown wasteland of alberta)?  All I know is this, Iginla is african for big Tree and when a big tree stands alone in a very flat area (ie Alberta) then he runs the risk of being struck by LIGHTNING. Coincidence? I think not.  Calgary is not my home. Nor are the flames my team. I am from Toronto, and my team is the Leafs. When the leafs are out, I pick favourites based on who I like and my love for good good hockey.  Tampa wins, in overtime, the goal being scored by your playoff MVP Bradley Richards. Dave Andreychuck kisses Lord Stanley's Cup after it eluded him for 22 years.  In the unlikely event of a Calgary victory, Miikka Kiprusoff will win the MVP, it will still be cool, but Andreychuck will cry and so will Doug Gilmour watching at home. Which makes me sad.  Here's to a great final and a great game 7.

      Flames in 6 Game 6 Flames Win 4-3 (overtime... again) goals: Iginla (Conroy, Simon), Richards (St. Louis, Kubina), St. Louis (Lecavalier, Richards), Yelle (Kobasew, Warrener), Iginla (Regehr, Conroy), (with 2 seconds left...) Lecavalier (Sydor, Richards) overtime goal scored by (who else?): Gelinas (Iginla, Saprykin)  im changing my prediction for one reason and one reason only. the flames have the MO-Mentum now and they're goin back to their building, you saw it in the san jose series. as much as i want to see a 7th game, (and as much as i want to see my boy dave andreychuck win the cup) the flames will win the stanley cup tommorrow night.  here's hopin im wrong.
