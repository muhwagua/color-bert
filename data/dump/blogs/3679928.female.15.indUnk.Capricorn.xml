      Well, today was Day Three in Room Eleven. We were treated to the joys of a french writing paper and a *shudders* two hour long history paper which was a bundle of fun. I havnt had that much fun since I last swallowed a light bulb, to coin a janeyism.  BUT I've already missed out the most important bussiness of the day. Today is my 15th birthday. Despite the exams, it's been a good day, and may I take this opportunity to say a big thanks to all my lovely friend who have been wonderful to me... and particularly Jenny who I just noticed has done a big Hazz birthday post... thankyou darling :D  Well, I set my table out in the exam room with my cards round it, and set about making paper hats. I think most people in the class had one by the end of the day, although very few held the highly regarded words  "A Hazz Original - A genuine hat from The Great Paper Hat Escapade"  Ween and Jen both decorated me a hat - Jen's with a variety of catch phrases and Ween's with the words  "This girl gets around... round, round, round, round, She gets around" on the back. Cheers Ween.  Audition for Camelot next week... our next school production... but lots of competition so I have no chance!!  Well, thats been today, along with quotable stupid thing -  Hazz: It's raining. That is to say, we are standing in, the rain Jenny: Great observation there Hazz.   A little while later, Jenny and Hazz are now in the lobby -   Hazz: We are no longer, standing in the rain. Yet still it rains. Jenny: *shakes head*

      don't you just love random-ness? 'Yes' i hear you say! Ok then, here you are, random-ness from us:  "999 999 998 green bottles, standing on a wall-" "Shut up hazz!"  "Awwww look at that cat!! Its so cute" "Span you've seen that picture every day for the past two months" "Yes but I only just realised what it was!" *runs over girlishly* "Awww, look at its head *points*, and *points to something else* "Span, are you pointing at his groin?"  "I think my hippyness is maturing!"  "LONG LIVE THE HOPPING WHORES!"   "Hazz is a wannabe pauper..."  "Jenny is a wannabe hag"   and here is some cool random random-ness:  "tis but a scratch!"  "and now for something completely different!"  "Melchy woke me up with all his banging..." "Didn't know he had it in him!" "No, I mean he was banging on the gates, and falling over...and singing a song about a...a girl with a dicky-di-do??"  "Hey ho, to the bottle I go, To heal my heart and drown my woe, rain may fall, and wind may blow, but there'll still be many miles to go. Sweet is the sound of the falling rain, and the stream that falls from hill to plain, better than rain, or rippling brook, is a mug of beer inside this Took!!"  "I could have quite literally snogged him until the cows came home. And when they came home I would have shouted:"WHAT HAVE YOU COWS COME HOME FOR? CAN'T YOU SEE I'M SNOGGING, YOU STUPID HERBIVORES???""  ok that's enough for now.  toodle pipski x x x

      Well, the weekend - far, far to busy. And far, far to much to write about in any great detail, but hey, I'll make a stab at it.  The weekend started much earlier then it usually does for me, I had my hair washed by half past eight. Much preparing, getting ready, finding of tights, eyeliner etc and by a mircale I was actually ready to go early. Pity the same couldn't be said for my brother. Anywho, off we went to The Big Family Christening, where there were lots of Annoying Little Children and lots of Don't-You-Remember-Such-and-Such. Answer - No, I dont remember them I was five when I last saw them. And amazingly enough, it's not a surprise I've grown since then. But, all in all, not too awful, saw some relative I havn't seen in a eon.  Speaking of eons, it took me about that to extract my parents and brother in time to get me to work. I swear, I got home (slightly drunk at this point) at six, and was still at work by quater past six, bow tie and all. The evening went well, and was a good laugh, even if the conversation did descend to new lows - it even reach a discussion about, off all thing, dog spunk. Anyway. Much hilarity over the gayness of Ed's gay italian trousers with gay italian pockets and the gay stance enhanced by the thumb ring. Ooo, the gayness. Bless him - and I hope he doesn't read this. Brief bouts of bubble throwing, dancing round the kitchen, but we pulled together and did well - and hey, I'm £30 better off for it. Well, towards the end of the evening the fun started - someone served Rosie bacardi and coke. To say she is a lightweight is to put it, err, lightly. Poor lass, she wont live that one down.  Got home around midnight, but couldn't sleep as I'd had possibly a little too much alcohol. In the end I got about three hours before waking at 5:30, getting into uniform and being delivered to SQN at 0645. Far to early for that little amount of sleep. Anyway, wandered about being bosy, until we left at a little past 0700. The discussion was once again hitting an all time low - onto the calorie content of dog spunk. Until Fraz mistook calories for "colours" and it progressed onto multicoloured dog spunk, until I cracked the terrible joke that had to be made -  "Taste the Rainbow"  - oh dear...   But the day was a good one, with our wonderful fanfare section bringing home a lovely example of fine sliverware and our persuccion section coming a second to Market Harborough Squadron. In fairness - they were very very good. But hey, we'll win next year. Well done to our Air Recce section coming second as well. And I'm sure, given a few years it'll be us winning not Derby Sqn.  But, all in all, long day, got back at around seven, and argh! no! I've lost Flt. Lt. Haynes's tie... so I should probably leave my stripes on the desk on the way out.  Well, the weekend was great, and has very unfortunatly resulted in me very much liking a certain someone I said I'd never like in that was as I'd known him too long... gaaah, I'm a bit confuzzled over that one to be honest.  And this week has been exams, exams, more exams, and a couple of games of ultimate frisbee. With the person I like. argh... Jen has already outlined the Great Shetland Escape, and I think to come soon is her account of my rendition of 999 999 999 Green Bottles (I didn't get much past 999 999 980 before Jenny dug her nails into my arm and I pushed her off the bench - first lad to say anything to do with saucers of milk gets err... something nasty done to him), my continous whisteling, and other humerous anecdotes that are getting us through exam week.  Will add more - possibly a transcript of some  genuine  Jenny and Hazz passed-in-an-exam notes...

          Today was the first day of our end of year exams. At lunchtime, our blessed oasis in a day full of tests, we found relief in sitting in our maths classroom attempting to make our dear Weenie laugh. The extent our exploits led only to Trish (otherwise known as Hazz), Span and myself blowing raspberries on our hands and attracting the attention of some annoying year sevens who were attempting to catch the latest in year 10 gossip, yet to no avail.Whilst taking a break from our amazingly mature *cough* amusements, I pointed at the distant junior school and cried "Look, horses! And they're moving..."     Of course the natural reaction was "Wow, jenny, horses...moving...they don't usually do that..".     For those who don't attend our crazy school, there is this man who lives on a small plot of land directly in the middle. He builds strange things like mud huts and he has a couple of ponies.     After being shooed out of the classroom by the lovely Mrs. Perrin ('induction youngsters!' ahem) and being let back in again, you can imagine our entire classes amusement and delight at the sight of two ponies nibbling at the grass on the 1st 15 pitch and cantering over to the cricket nets. Joy of joys, the shetlands had escaped. Ands so, as I sit here, the horses are happily munching their way through our cricket square...

      Greetings Earthlings! I come in peace!  I expect that this page will turn out to be a succession of random blackadder and monty python quotes considering i have the imagination similar to that of a very unimaginative pygmy shrew, but there you go.  In response to Hazz's doodah about shoes i have taken the test, and it turns out that i am:  Sandals- peaceful, daydreamy, and thoughtful, you often find yourself staring into space. When you aren't out volunteering you are often just dreaming away. You enjoy the company of friends sometimes but enjoy peace and quiet.  [see right for picture under my 'Stuff']  not what i'd have originally thought of, but wotever...  so, what have i been doing lately?....not a lot, unless you count obsessing over the fact that we're doing camelot next year as the school musical and that i am desperately hoping to snatch the part of guinevere and not have to drunkenly dance around dressed as a whore, albeit a medieval one  i also wrote and hosted a murder mystery party for my darling sister. who would have thought, the cook, the receptionist AND the gold digging sister?!  other than that, i have been worrying about school exams and laughing at pictures such as this:     ttfn, me x

      Well, this is a one-girl-blog no longer. I'd like to offer a big welcome to the latest adition to the blog, the amazing, the talented, the absolutley gorgeous....   Jennifer Sarah Dean!   Hereafter known as  Jen  as I can't be bothered to write that out every time. Apologies if this now turns into a Jen-and-Me-Wierd-Sense-of-Humour-fest, but, as they say, live with it.  Jen is an amazingly talented musician and actress, not to mention being stoopidly clever (wahey what a paradox) and being a slim leggy blonde (bitch). She has one pet, a little sister called Rosie, who we all love because she's a sort of MiniHazz, but without the overly wierd bits. She lives with her mum and her dad, who I tease mercilessly because he comes from Yorkshire. Mind you, he teases me mercilessly about just about everything. When Jen grows up she wants to be a Doctor (que "Awww isn't that nice?")  So yea, introducing another member to the blog, the one and only -  Jen!

       -Time consuming and completely pointless   As I'm still cooped up with my mystery illness, I have been doing very little of note, so I have decided to comment on a news story I found. For those avid fans among you, you may recognise the title of this post as a quote from the third series of Blackadder, (episode five if I am not mistaken). And yes, there is a reason why I have used it... when browsing the BBC website I came accross this new article...   urlLink Surf the Net While Surfing Waves   The essence of which being the fact they have manages to put a laptop with internet access into a surfboard. This was the secondary story in the "Technology" section of the BBC news website. Now, maybe this is just my cynicism creeping through, but what exactly is the point in this technological advance?   We have people dieing in the developing world from famine, war, disease, drought, landmines and a myriad of other nasty things, and yet here in the priviliged west we are investing out time and money into advances such as this. Now, the news article does make very clear that this is nothing but a showing of technological prowess, and far be it from me to criticise the developers for wanting to show of what they can do, but at another point in the article they stress how difficult it was not upsetting the balance of the surfboard. Now this is all very well, but why not try investing some of this time and effort into something a little more worthwhile?

      Just took quite an odd quiz - What kind of shoe am I?   And apparntly -  Barefoot- free, rebellious, and wild, you hate boundries and rules. You tend to be on the crazy side and often sweep people up along with you. You are most likely the leader of your group of friends.  Erm well, I wouldn't say I was the leader, I'm just the one that talks the most and thus gets lumbered with organising everything. But hating boundries and rules? Well, I've grown a little more conservative as the years roll by, but I draw your attention to this picture of me a few years back -    Somethings don't change, eh?

      Well, here's the first entry in my newly created blog. I'm not entirely sure what sort of thing I'm going to write in it, but I guess a good way to "find direction" (to coin an exceedingly nauseating phrase) is to just start writing about what's been happening to me.  I'll start at the same time I started this blog - that is some time yesterday evening. I was chatting on MSN to a few people, and for the umpteenth time in the past 11 days trying to work out how I feel about Him, what we mean to each other, and if, indeed we did ever mean anything to each other anyway. My take on the whole situation now is that it's all far too complicated, it's probably best just to get on with life and avoid those terrible situations with (usually) girlfriends when every little scrap of infomation is disected, analysed, and spat back at you with feminst "men are bastards" crap stamped all over it. Cheers gals, but I knew that already.  As I'm  still  ill after three and a half days now, I was hurled out of bed at an ungodly hour and plonked before a doctor for the second time this week. After poking me, prodding me, shining lights at me, sticking things in me, searching questions and other thoroughly unpleasant procedures he revealed to me, with much triumph, that it was all right, because I didn't have meningitis. Isn't that a relief? To be perfectly honest being struck down with meningitis wasn't at the top of my list of worries. After more prodding me he gave me some rather suspicious looking little white tablets, which I am to take three times daily. This will, apparently, stop me vomitting. Thats really great Doc, thanks a lot, I'm very grateful, but why didn't you give me these on Monday when I  had first started heaving up the contents of my inards? However, since I took the first one I havn't been sick, so fingers crossed that here's an end to it and I'll be all right by the weekend.  Ahh, the weekend. I've actually been looking forwad to this weekend for months. Saturday see's me dressed up in pink and white tweed and pointy shoes being the wonderful neice/daughter/grandaughter/godchild/other relative that I am at my baby cousin Henrietta's christening. I'm wearing my pearls now to try and polish them up before the event, in fact. The more you wear pearls the shinier they get, you see.  Saturday evening and I'm switiching hats again, although not literally as for both occassions I won't be wearing a hat. I'm waitressing with cadets on Saturday night at the TA Centre, which is always a laugh and the money's good.  Sunday - The much talked about, long awaited Wing Field Day is upon us. It'll mean a hideously early start, the caring and loving transportation of my uniform and shoes to RAF Wittering ready for a busy day. I have the drill, band and leadership competitions to look forwad to, and as I'm no longer a squirt cadet wise it'll mean lots of catching up with friends from around the wing. I'll collapse into bed thoroughly wrecked on Sunday evening only to be awoken on Monday morning for the dreaded exams. I cannot wait.

      I was going to write stuff here from my diary (under hazz's instruction), but i have decided against that because it is boring.  So, I'm going to write about my weekend, as it was marginally more interesting. On Saturday I went to orchestra on the bus, almost as normal, except that it was Mia's birthday so she received 'lush' stuff, a necklace and a wonderful bonsai potato kit from yours truly. She liked the potato thing the best. We had a rehearsal in holy trinity church, then came home. Smeg would like to inform the T.O. flutes that their 'diagrammatic undulating was chronologically defective', by the way. We then had a very cool concert, and then orchestra was over, for EVER!! Ok maybe not forever, but until next year, and then i might not be in the same orchestra as all my friends anyway :(. Anyway, continuing:  Sunday - three hour netball practice. This included a short spell of exceedingly hot sunshine whilst me and hazz were attempting to get money from people. It didn't work. One woman stole a brochure from us - we were NOT impressed.  Monday (okay not just the weekend) - school - WOOHOO!! Going the exam papers, and and i could hardly contain my excitement. After school was chamber, not a wholly interesting day...  Tuesday - This was the day when we managed to come up with a plan that made a little year seven cry! She may be a stalker, but all the same, I feel guilty. Maxine is a 12 year old girl in love with our friend Alex. She is infatuated. She stalks him. She stole his shorts!! Anyways....Now most of year seven think that Alex and I are going out...How wrong they are. Maxine was reported to have been crying in distress, simply because he had his arm around me at break time...oops.  Wednesday - Class trip to Nottingham. Without going into detail, the Galleries of Justice were deadly boring, and the Woman in Black was dead. Urgh i hate ghost stories, but this one creeped me out more than most. I can't speak for Hazz, but i was clutching onto her trying (and failing) to take looong deep breaths. I had to sleep with the lights on...  Thursday - Nothing much of interest except being the last day of ours as year tens, and everyone was getting annoyed as we constantly cried "WE'RE GOING TO CANADA!!". Also, I had my audition for Camelot - by the way, LOVING your french accent Hazz...  "I would never make anyone live by my standards, your Majesty!"

       O Canada! Our home and native land! True patriot love in all thy sons command.  With glowing hearts we see thee rise, The True North strong and free!  From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  God keep our land glorious and free! O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.  O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.   Well ladels and gentlespoons, the time has finally arrived and Jen and I are heading off to Canada within the next eight hours. Have finished packing, have "depilated" my legs, and listened to Jen's screams down the phone as she waxed some slightly more sensitive parts...  I can't believe we're actually going. It seems like only a few months ago that I was about to go on my first annual camp with cadets, but in reality a whole year has passed. Wierd.  Been having lots of fun since I last posted, on Saturday I went shopping in preparation for Canada and bought lots of lovely stuff, and on Sunday I went to mass before heading out to netball practice and running round in the heat getting a really good adrenaline buzz. Before the end of the practice, I began to feel a little queasy and in the car on the way to my aunt's I felt positivly unwell. I was quietly sick at my aunts house, and again in the car on the way back, and was sick for the rest of the evening despite what mum claims as a miricale cure - a bath. This got me thoroughly worried as I was due to be flying the next day... but luckily when I woke up I was absolutly fine.  At the AEF on Monday I luckily didn't have to hang around in the crew room, but donned a stylish luminous yellow jacket and wondered about on the flight line, which was great. My flight itself was good, gently pottering about the sky is very relaxing, although the cockpit was stiffling.  Then... the week at school with the excursion on Wednesday to Nottingham, where we met up with NottinghamAlex (and Jenny fell in lurve with him, and he with her, so yay!). Sadly, final two days as a year ten have been mind numbingly boring. Going through exams - joy of joys! But came out with not too bad marks, and as I didn't revise at all for any exam as I was ill, I'm rather pleased.  And, love life wise, all is shaping up nicely, Jenny has met someone, and although she approaching the whole thing with her normal brand of relationship pessamism I think it just might work :D. I am back with Him, very happy and very much in love. Awwww. I made this little graphic... which is more then my life is worth posting it, but I think its sweet...     So, I will soon be jetting off to Canada... wish me well :D

      Trish/Hazz ordered me to update the blog so.. I will do my best. So, what's happened? I'll start with Friday night. Liz, Janey, Sophie and myself gathered at Trish's house for a 'night out'. Trish decided to take us to a pub, much to our disapproval. Not so much disapproval, we just didn't want to go in in fear of being asked for ID. Some random guy came over to our table.. "Sam?" .....I looked at him in confusion. "Oh, sorry. You look like my brothers girlfriend." Sure, ugly boy. He then asked us for our names but we were shoved out by some woman. We then decided to go to a restaurant..and ended up at Joe's Diner. We ate. Walked to Mikeys where the trading standards people were, so we quickly moved on. Blah blah blah. We ended up back at Trish's and played a drinking Simpsons game (whenever you hear Bart, Homer, Maggie etc, you take a swig or a shot) So.. a few swigs later (emphasis on the  few ) Janey and Sophie were out of their heads bumping into walls, chipping their teeth and eating bowl upon bowl of cereal. Trish and I laughed at them - lots. So, the night went on. More was drunk and people became more.. drunk. I remember Janey and I playing air guitar along to a Jimmy Hendrix album, but that's about it. Janey was put to bed by a drunken Ween, and Sophie ended up being carried from the bathroom by Trish. I have to say, Trish and I did a great job of looking after drunk friends, even though we were completly drunk too. As soon as she woke up, Sophie was ill and she stayed in the bathroom all morning. I drank a glass of raw egg and milk - disgusting. Janey ate more cereal. I am never drinking neat vodka ever, ever again. It's  HORRIBLE!

       Earlier today I got back from a run with my brother. Well, I say a run, it felt more like a six hour long sprint, however in reality it was sadly no more then about 20 mins running and 15mins walking... (quickly, and up a beast of a hill). About 15 minutes in when my sides were about split from stitches, I could hear my heart pounding in my ears and my limbs were about to drown in lactic acid, it occured to me what a silly and pointless thing I was putting myself through.  Jogging, I feel, is not only self inflictured torture but one of the most socially degrading forms of exercise going. No matter how fit you are and how well you cope with your routine, it always projects a negative image on those that you might happen to pass whilst on your run.  If, as in my case, your cheeks have turned a fetching shade of scarlet and more liquid has passed through your pores then passes through India during the monsoon, your chances of forming any sort of relationship with those you pass, should you ever find yourself in a social setting with said people, have suddenly hit not only rock bottom, but have decided to go through said bottom and are now somewhere in Austrailia, probably at a barbeque and undoubtadly drinking Foster's.  However, if you are at the other end of the scale and breeze through your jog, your pores still as dry as an Ethiopian summer, you will leave those you pass with a completely different impression, and not one that is necessarily that much desired over the first. If I were, say, strolling up a hill and a spandex coated jogger (bearing more than a passing resemblance to a liquerice alsort) passed me, my initial thoughts would sadly not be of a congratulatory nature... I am far more likely to be thinking  "Oh my god s/he's insane, and s/he's a hell of a lot fitter then me. *Insert Expletive Here*"  Once again, if I were to meet this jogger in a social setting it is more than likely I would be indulging in a quite vicious attempt to get one up on this jogger, which is never good for conversation.

      Weeeeell, as my first post I thought I’d write my account of the tour. Don’t worry; it’ll only be small seeing as you’ve read two versions already.  So, the highlights of the tour were: - 1. discovering chocolate bars with funny names e.g. Big-Turk and Oh, Henry! 2. seeing Hazz look a cross between the grinch and a rabbit when we got her face painted 3. Jen + I getting a horn thing honked at us from a huge truck 4. having various fights with people in the halls, and one where I defeated Hazz by snapping her bra (take that you beach!) 5. being able to wear ponchos and feel at the height of fashion  Yeah, so that’s my first post done. They will get more interesting when I think of something interesting to talk about.

      What could be better than reliving Cananda (well, many things, but that's beside the point)? Here are some of the best things that were said on our beloved trip:  Janey : Jen and I need to go to Anti-munting school!  Janey (about Sean the head boy(on camera)): I'd have him!!  Weenie: The cleaner's stole my Big-Turk!!  Weenie: My tit is peeling!  Span : kankered  Span : That car is making no noise at all!!  Weenie (at school, in choir): Right, I'm going alto, that song is like ultrasound (followed by dad exclaiming "you learnt something!?")      ~*~ On Camera ~*~     Janey's words;  Well, what happened is we were discussing the guys, and i said "I'd 'ave 'im!" about Sean, and Clews was filming as a joke (can i point out that it WAS a joke!!)  Hazz's comments;  right, can i now point out that janey did not KNOW clews was filming, so janey is now immortalised by the phrase "I'd have him! (anyday) "  and I'm sure she's not the only one...   Convo in the blog book      jen      Ween      Tom's girlfriends need to go to anti-munting school!      Jen sucks turkey dick      No that's you - and completely unrelated to the point      um....yeah.

      Right, very very sorry I havn't updated very much of late - after getting back from Canada I was loathe to even try and put together a coherent account of the fortnight.  Anyway, I'll try and compile some sort of summary of the past five weeks -   Weeks 1 & 2 - Canada...  Well, what can I say. An amazing two weeks... pity we didn't do too well in our matches, although we learnt a lot and improved a lot while we were away. We did lots of amazingly cool stuff, had an incredable time... I really can't put it into words. Jen still has our tour book... with silly quotes etc, so when she's around I'll get her to post some of that stuff. I havn't scanned in most of my photos, but here's one of me at Niagra Falls...    urlLink http://img33.exs.cx/img33/4761/SmallNiagraFalls.jpg
