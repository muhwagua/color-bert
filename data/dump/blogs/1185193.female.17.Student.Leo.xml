       Friends Aren't Forever?   I felt so offended by something my friend said to me today.  I opened up to her, confiding how difficult it has been for me to dance and attend dance classes, and how my dance teacher and I have been meeting outside of class to catch me up on the performance numbers.  There was a brief silence, and all of the sudden, she started telling me how frustrating it is when little kids at her studio stop attending classes because it adds the stress of rearranging choreography to accomodate their uncomittment.  What?!  Could she just listen to me and ask me questions regarding my situation?  Was she inferring that I was uncomitted, like one of the little children?  She just made me so angry, but before I could say anything, we peeled off into our classrooms.  It is incredible to me how hard it is for some people to just be good friends sometimes, especially when another friend opens up.  Maybe that silence indicated that she just didn't know how to respond.  But that's bull because we have been friends since first grade.  Nevertheless, whenever I try to find some solace inside of one of my friends regarding my illness, I'm always shut out.  It is almost as intense as opening up your heart to someone you love and deeply care about, and feeling almost a sense of betrayal and shame after it is not received.  But then again, maybe she just didn't know how to respond...but what are the rest of my friends' excuses?   Random Blurbs   Here are some random observations I made at school today:  1.  Adrienne always eats Cheese-Its for lunch.  She talks too much and always has the orange carbs infecting her braces,  And when she throws back her head to laugh, you can see it caked on the inside of her cheeks.  *shudder*  2.  No one in the library seriously works, except Jacob Inglander (sp?).  He wore a magenta polo shirt today.  Combined with his yellow back pack and hair that is fierce competition for Gianni Garbagnati, I'd say Jacob is definetely gay.  Maybe bi.  Clearly, I'm only speculating, but he just has that look.  (don't worry, I'm not homophobic, I'm simply making an observation).  3.  Conversation from the frosh table at lunch revealed the main difference in how to "be cool" at Bellarmine v. Mitty.  At Bell it is cool to participate and raise your hand in class; in other words, it's cool to be a teacher's pet.  At Mitty, no one likes the person who is involved in a teacher's lecture in class (*cough* Catherine Dietrich)--that would be lame.  If a teacher chooses to call on people for participation, everyone is chanting "Don't pick me" frantically under their breath.  (In no way does this challenge Mitty's unquestionable superior intelligence over Bell :)  4.  For the first time, I heard Dorothy Lau speak today.  If I closed my eyes, I would have never guessed that that was her voice.  As a somewhat cruel joke, she is known to many as "the antelope."  She walks with a hilarious natural bounce on the balls of her feet.  I'd like to see her try and balance a book on her head.  Her name is also derived from the fact that she runs through the grass and flower planters to get to class.  In conclusion, does anyone know if Shingles is contagious?  Mr. Fajardo has Shingles and I accidentally sat in the same chair in the library as he did.  Should I be worried?

       "Supermodel work, turn it to the left!  Work, turn it to the right!"   Anyone know that song besides me? *silence with intermittent coughs*  Okay...  So I bought this really cool tech toy called Virgin Something-Or Rather (I can't remember the whole name, and no, it's not what it may sound like).  Anyways, I bought it for when I go to the gym.  It is a compact am/fm radio..or so I thought when I bought it.  Actually, it turns out to be the most amazing little apparatus I've ever discovered.  Not only does it have the radio, but it has t.v. stations and some other thing that is supposed to be cool that I don't understand.  So when I'm working out, I can listen to live t.v.!  How cool is that?!  Anyways, the bad thing is that it came with those piddely-ass earphones you are supposed to stick in your ears.  Except my ears are deformed because they always fall out.  When sitting.  And you can imagine running.  People probably think I have some kind of rash in my ears because I always touch them to keep the earphones in.  Or if they were intelligent they would see cords hanging down and realize it was a little walkman.  But then it comes back to the issue of deformed ears...*sigh*  So I need your help...I have been given two suggestions to solve this problem:  1.  Hold them in with scotch tape.  (Interesting idea but if I am sweating, won't the tape come off??) 2.  Wear REAL earphones.  The kind that has the band over your head and outer ear covers.  (But isn't that dorky these days?  All the cool people [I'm cool right???] wear the petite, posh ones).  So many choices.  Any suggestions?  Please leave them in "La Caja Mágica" (for those linguistically challenged, that means "The Magical Box"  :)

       Zoom, Zoom, Zoom   I received my first ticket today.  I knew that I was going to get one, but I defiantly ignored the risk.  When I later came out to my car to go home, I saw the little white paper on my windshield and sighed as my heart sank.  It was only $10, but I still felt ashamed.  This added yet another crack in my perfection facade that I try so hard to keep up.  Finally, after accepting the fact that I had gotten the ticket, I moved back into an apathetic state.  It was really no big deal, right?  Let me set up the situation for you.  My first class was at 11:40am this morning.  By the time I get to school to find a parking space, all the legal ones are taken.  Usually, however, I do get lucky and find a good one.  Because  urlLink my school  is located in a residential neighborhood, there are certain parking restrictions to accomodate the complaining neighbors.    I was driving down Mitty Way at approximately 11:30, with no parking spot in sight.  I did not want to be late to class; I have never been late to class ever.  So I weighed my decision carefully.  There were two possible punishments I could receive: a $10 parking ticket issued by my school, not by Santa Clara County police, or I could get a detention for being late to class, which would linger on my school record.  I chose the $10 ticket.  I parked in a "no parking zone" and went to class.  In addition, I thought that since my class was only 55 minutes, that it was unlikely that the little old parking lady would tag my car that soon.  How naive!  Well, it actually kind of feels good that getting my first ticket is over with.  It could have been worse!

       Communists Now Least Threatening Group In U.S.   According to a report released Tuesday by the Pentagon, Communists rank last on a list of 238 threats to national security. "Communists may now safely be ignored," Secretary of Defense William Cohen said. "The Red Menace has been surpassed by militia groups, religious extremists, ecoterrorists, cybercriminals, Hollywood producers, and angry drivers." Other groups deemed more threatening than Communists include rap-metal bands (#96), escaped zoo animals (#202), and Belgians (#237).

       "Not if I see you first, love."   The chilling last words of Lauren from Alias.  OMG!  All you Alias fans, did you get it?  I mean, like what set off fireworks in Jack's head when she said it?  When Marshall recovered the tape recorder from Sark's airplane transport, they picked up a transmission of Sark making a phone towards the end.  And he said the same words-- "Not if I see you first, love."  I am literally jumping up and down in my seat and clapping my hands right now!!  Do you know what this means?  Jack suspects Lauren as being the mole working for the Covenant.  Which means she will be caught...which means Vaughn will break up with her...which means Sydney and Vaughn will finally be reunited!!!!!!  Don't you love how it all works out in the end?!  Oh, the excitement!  *sigh of relief*  Anyways, for a drastic change of subject, this afternoon I had an uncontrollable hunger for Jelly Belly Sours.  Have you ever eaten them?  My mouth is watering just thinking about them!  So I made a trip down to Long's just to get a little bag of them.  Mmmm...sweetness for the soul.  Those little glossy, colorful, sweet melons are incredibly delicious, and everyone should try them.  Once again, they're called Jelly Belly Sours--at Long's--in the candy aisle--for $1.99 (or .89, I was too overcome by their juicy goodness that price doesn't matter :)

       A Fickle Pickle of a Day   Today transformed from horrible to good to horrible to good.  Exactly in that sequence.  It started out horrible because I woke up at the regular time--6am--to leave for school at 7am.  Little did I know, there was a faculty/staff meeting and I could have slept in.  This would have been a good thing because I was awake all night last night.  My only time of relief from my illness last night was robbed from me.  It kind of set my whole day off lop-sided.  Plus, I had school from 8:30-2:35--my longest day of the week.  *sigh*  And then along came good.  Do you ever have one of those days that seems like it's from the t.v. series Cheers?..."Where everybody knows your name."  Okay, sounds kind of corny.  Yeah, really stupid.  But I'm talking about when you're strutting your stuff down the hallways at school and like everyone either gives you a pleasant smile or says, with enthusiasm, "Hi *insert name here*!"  And you've got your best outfit on, have an awesome hair and makeup day, and feel like you're walking on Cloud Nine.  Even better, you've got no homework due on Friday or Monday.  The sun is shining and everything seems to be clicking together perfectly, until...  You visit your doctor, and she gives you terrifying--and I mean teeth chattering--news about your present health condition.  She says if you have another one of those attacks that you'll have to be hospitalized. Eek!  Excuse my use of second person..one word: Denial.  Drum roll please...my last "good" of the day.  Bobby, Veronika and I went out to Chili's for dinner.  They serve some mean chicken tacos (guacamole added, of course).  And because of Shirlene and Steve, we ordered the Chocolate Molten Cake.  Yum!  After that, we drove to Veronika's home in Mountain View and visited with her mom, Aniko.  Aniko makes the best lemonade ever...EVER.    Anyhoo, since I got absolutely no sleep last night, I better get to bed.  Sweet dreams everyone!

       "I'll have a virgin strawberry daiquiri, or just a virgin"   ¡Viva Las Vegas!  I had a great time in Vegas this weekend.  It was full of tropical drinks (virgins, of course), lazy afternoons at one of the five pools at the MGM Resort, shopping, eating, shows, and walks up and down The Strip.  And I actually got semi-tanned.  WooHoo!  The flight to Las Vegas out of San Jose Mineta was about an hour and twenty minutes.  Not bad.  What shocked me the most is that as soon as we stepped off the plane into the Las Vegas airport, there were slot machines everywhere.  Gambling in Nevada is as common as going to the grocery store in San Jose.  It was a little scary realizing how some people's lives revolve around money.  Las Vegas is a very materialistic city.  And yes, sex sells.  While walking the strip, many non-English speaking minorities try to give you little cards, about the size of baseball cards, that display naked women with numbers to call for 'a good time.'  They do this weird Morse code like sound with the cards.  At different intervals, they flip and flap the cards to echo noises.  I guess it's supposed to get our attention.  If you ever go to Vegas, do not stay at the MGM Grand Resort.  It looks spectacular from the outside, but the rooms are pricey, even though they're average at best.  They don't have a coffee maker, a refrigerator, or a microwave.  At $300 per night, I expected it to be fully equipped with all the standard appliances.  On Sunday night, at the time that I would usually be sitting on the edge of my couch watching Alias, I attended a performance of Mama Mía at Caesar's Palace.  Talk about a great show!  It was fabulous!  The theater was so high-tech; in addition, it had cup holders in the arms of the seats like a movie theater.  Only in Vegas can one drink alcohol while watching a professional show.  It was awesome!  If you ever have the chance to see Mama Mía, do it!  The only question I have is, who decided one day to sit down and write a musical around Abba songs?  I had an overall wonderful experience, although I wouldn't go back again unless we were meeting our friends from Texas there.  It's always fun to go away, but it's always nice to come back home  :)

       Oh, Crap!   Crap.  I just realized something.  My family and I are going to Las Vegas this Friday through Monday.  Can someone PLEASE tape Alias for us?  I will be at a performance of Mama Mía on Sunday night.  Pretty pretty please!  On a side note, do you think Sloane is Syd's father?  My mom and I have been predicting that since season one because he has always said how he thinks of her as a daughter.  And I'm sorry, but Sloane and Dr. Barnett?  Umm, no.  And what's up with this year's season?  There have been barely any episodes because of all the Emmy/Golden Globe crap.  The new episodes are supposed to air continuesly for the rest of the season.  *fingers crossed*  Let me know if you will tape it...

       No More Passion   My illness is getting the best of me.  It started by paralyzing me in bed, being unable to function normally.  Then it took my concentration away, forcing me to bargain with the associate principal of my school to waive half of my classes--which he did.  Now it has robbed me of my passion, the one thing that I could depend on to bring me some relief, the one thing that made it easier to get out of bed in the morning.  Gone.  Snap, crackle, gone.  My passion in life is/was dance.  It gave me peace of mind and happiness through its rythmic grace.  I loved the feeling of escape from my everyday stresses, delivered by the symphonic beat of the music and the body movements entwined into it.    Last night, I had my jazz class.  It is the only dance class I am taking because I couldn't handle my full schedule, which I feel is a weakness on my part.  But, whatever.  Anyways, I felt really out-of-sorts to begin with, like everything was in slow motion and I was one step behind it all.  I couldn't grasp the new dance moves to our Wonder Woman dance; I felt like jelly.  I felt my head swelling up, my face burning, my eyes watering, and my heart sinking.  Why can't I do this?  I kept repeating the same question, with each repitition more intense.  I quietly told my teacher, who knows of my recent condition, that I had to go, and she understandingly dismissed me.   As I was quickly walking to my car, the sensation of cool air against my furnace face felt sharp and harsh.  Tears streamed down my face.  Why can't I do this?  It's my passion--Why?  Locking myself in my car, I rest my head on my steering wheel and had a full blown panic attack.  I was bawling like a baby and screaming at myself.  If I can't dance, and since everything else has been taken away from me, what is there to live for?  I felt as though everything was slipping away from me, everything that I have worked for years to attain was vanishing right in front of me.  At this point, I was shaking with anger--resentment of this disease and bitterness towards myself.  Why can't I handle it?  In that moment, I knew I was a failure.  A failure to myself--all my goals that I have been striving for are gone, and I have no control over it.  I struggled to drive home.  Still bawling and screaming, with my anger now directed at God, I sped down the street.  I parked on the curb outside of my house and could physically and mentally not get myself out of my car.  My soul was shattered.  My mom had to practically carry me out of my car and into the house.  Eventually, with all the energy sucked out of me, I ceased crying, ate dinner, took my medication, and went to bed.   Pretty uplifting first entry, eh?  Today was a little better.  But I'm too tired of typing to tell you about it.

       Clumsy Megan, Always Spilling Things   2:35pm--school's out.  Famished from not eating lunch and trying to operate on a 6am bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios, I race down to  urlLink Whole Foods  to get something to eat.  I love their store so much because it has diverse, fun food.   Plus, it also has totally delectable fresh food  to order. So I headed over to that section on the far left of the store and got an organic burrito, sliced pineapple, and a  urlLink Pom .  Sounds yummy, right?  So I return home, pop the burrito in the microwave, and begin devouring my  pineapple and juice.  By this time, I am like  starving for this spicy, succulent burrito.  I am literally tapping my foot, counting down with the microwave.  Bing!  Oh, yes...it smells so good!  I set up my little lunch on the paper bag that it came in by the computer to check on the afros that I ordered for my Jefferson's dance.  I decide to print the confirmation receipt of my order, roll back my chair to reach the printer, and my food goes flying everywhere!  It  was another one of those "f***!" Starbuck's moments.  I didn't even get a taste of the burrito before it gracefully hit midair and plummeted to the carpet!  I scrambled to salvage it, but it was definetely unedible-looking.  Since it has been getting warmer outside, my cat has been shedding her hair, and we've been doing our best to keep the carpet clean, but the the cat hair was glued to the innerds (innards? too lazy to look it up) of the burrtio.  Very disappointed.  So I just ate my pineapple and drank my Pom, cursing at my cat and my natural tendency to spill things.

       Community Service Essay   I present to you my community service essay, which I hastily threw together in 30 minutes.  It is a bunch of fluffed up crap.  Sometimes I tried to be funny because my teacher has corny humor--well not corny, just her own bizarre  humor--with the intention that I'd land some extra points.  Let me know what you think.  Megan Reuter Mrs. Walker Ethics (1) 4/28/04  		Without a sense of caring, there can be no sense of community 		-Anthony J. D'Angelo    	In order to build a sense of care and compassion in my community, I volunteered at O'Connor Hospital.  Every Saturday morning--when I would usually still be snoring--I put on my Candy Striper uniform and drove down the road to the hospital.  I must admit that in those lethargic morning hours, most of the time I did not want to be going to volunteer.  I would rather be at my ballet technique class or teaching toddlers the art of dance.  Instead, I willingly made a sacrifice to give back to all my community has given to me.  My way of giving back was working in an environment with people I do not normally associate with.    	Upon arrival at the hospital, I slowly trekked my way through the sinuous hallways.  The hallways were always cold, with a slight smell of Neosporin.  Every time I hiked to my destination, thoughts inundated my mind such as, how could someone ill possibly recover in such a sullen environment or why don't they paint the walls a bright, healthy color?   These rhetorical questions were only designed to occupy my half-asleep brain until I arrived at the Mail Room.    	Only God knows why they named this room the Mail Room because there was no mail inside.  This was the lowly volunteer hub, an incommodious room, even more frigid than the hallways.  The room was dressed with cement walls and floors, a ghetto stereo that always played Hispanic music, and recycled office chairs for volunteers to sit in.  The only pleasant element of this room was that it had all the latest issues of InStyle, People, and Cosmopolitan magazines.      	So, the basic routine went like this: the phone rang, the adult employee answered it and wrote down the request, and the student volunteer carried out the assignment.  The only trouble came when there were three or more volunteers; for example, let's say their names were Megan, Hilda, and Rupert.  The adult volunteer would say he had an assignment to be carried out.  All three of the volunteers' eyes would rise from their magazines and look at one another, telepathically sending messages like, I already went, it's your turn or there's no way I'm getting up again.  One of them, let's say Megan, graciously accepts the task and performs it with compassion.    	A volunteer could be given a myriad of tasks to execute.  The most common would be to deliver supplies to different wings of the hospital.  These supplies ranged in variety from surgical gowns to urine catheters, and would travel to different sections such as the Emergency Room or Labor and Delivery.  Those kind of jobs required superior knowledge of the hospital's layout, which came each week with trial and error.   Another example of a task that would be asked of a volunteer would be to take blood and urine samples to the lab for analysis.   These samples could be the difference between life and death for many patients, especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  If a volunteer was called to retrieve a sample from the ICU, he or she could not spend time dawdling, looking at the old lady volunteers' pictures on the wall that have been volunteering at the hospital for half a century, rather, he or she would have to speedily give the samples to the lab.  Quickness was important with these samples because most patients in the ICU are near death, and results are needed promptly.  It was nerve racking to me that I was holding a person's fate in my own hands, so I took the job seriously, only stopping to look at the pictures after I dropped off the sample.             The last example of a task--a personal favorite of mine--would be discharging the patients downstairs and wheeling them outside to get in their cars and go home.  My favorite patients were the mothers and newborns because they looked so thrilled to be alive to celebrate their lives together; moreover, the babies were awfully cute.  They just looked so inspired by the world, full of new promises and hopes.              However, I did also enjoy discharging the elderly patients, except on one occasion.  This old Mexican lady must have weighed near 400 pounds because it was near impossible to get her into a wheelchair.  Her daughter was with her to take her home.  After a few attempts to get her comfortable in the wheelchair without further impairing her broken leg, we set off to go downstairs.  The antiquated wheelchair squealed across the linoleum of the lobby and rotated out the revolving door.  Trying to get her out of the wheelchair was the worst because the footrests did not return to their idle position.  Her daughter impatiently yelled at me, "Don't you know what the hell you're doing?"  Even in the midst of frustration with the impossible equipment and the ignorant woman, I kept my cool.  Although, needless to say, it was one of the more unpleasant experiences I went through at the hospital.           In conclusion, I think I would never work there again, but I do value the lessons I learned while I was there.  I learned to live up to my commitments, even though it would have been easier to quit; but most of all, I learned that patience really is a virtue.

       Too Purpose Driven   I have officially given up on my   urlLink purpose driven life  .  I found the book to be way too extreme.  It made some good points that were worth internalizing; however, I thought the book was suggesting a lifestyle that only clergy could relate to.  It talked about totally surrendering one's life to God, and that if every aspect of one's life is not driven towards pleasing God, then one will never find happiness.  One section I really had a problem with was entitled, "We Bring God Glory By Loving Other Believers."  What about Jesus' pivotal message of loving your enemy?  Should we then despise non-Christians and pay no atttention to them?  I was hoping for some explanation in the section, but was left with the same feeling as when I read the title: utter disgust.  My parents seem to love the book, anxiously asking one another everyday, "Have you read it yet today?"  Give me a break!  The book is more disturbing than life-changing!  Don't waste your time and money on this one.

       Indecisiveness...Oh, Joy!   Since I can't decide on what to write about, I'll just start writing...  We're not going to Hawaii.  We're doing our Great Lakes trip again, which is fine by me because that is my favorite part of the country and with the extra money from not going to Hawaii, we are going to get a jet-jacuzzi bath tub and redo our bathroom.  When most people think of Minnesota, South Dakota, Illonois, Wisconsin and Iowa, they usually think How boring! or What's there to see there?  But there are so many wonderful  things.  For example, the Great Mall of America (the biggest mall in the US with a theme park in the middle), visiting the Amish people and eating their cinnamon rolls, driving all day to get to the Powder House Lodge to dine in a beautiful cabin eating buffalo stew by the fireplace, staying in a hotel where the whole first floor is the wildest water park ever and where the room has a jacuzzi next to the bed, riding the Ducks, and much MUCH more.  And then there's the best part: RIA.  She is such an amazing woman, even though she is Bobby's ex.  Imagine a long distance relationship between CA and MN--yeah,  you could guess it didn't work.  But we absolutely love her and her family.  I wonder if they'll have that Rock Fest while we're in her hometown of Prior Lake, MN.  Hopefully she won't be in Ireland while we're there!  In conclusion, no Hawaii still equals happiness.  OH, I almost forgot...eating at the Cracker Barrel.  Yum.  This summer I am working at SMT's Vacation Bible Camp.  But instead of just being a youth aide, I have been offered my own classroom!!!!!  I will be the camp counselor, NOT her assistant that does the dirty work.  I am so excited.  I will either have first or second graders.  I get to plan our activities and lead them through the day.  I love working with children and I think this will be a good experience.  It  also prepares me for what I want to do with my life someday--be a first or second grade teacher!  Awesome!  Just for the record, here are a few of my life's goals: Get a BA in liberal arts Get my teaching credential (while I teach in a Catholic school) Buy a new car when I graduate from college Get an apartment when I graduate from college Teach dance at my dance studio during college (I plan to stay local) ...hmm....can't think of anything else right now, but that's a good start, right?  Riiiiight.  Hohum.  That's about it for now.  Except I have to complain about the scorching hot temp.  I sit in a house with no a/c using one of those ghetto, creaky rotating fans for some relief.  An ice cold Jamba Juice sounds good right about now...

       Latest Alias Blurbs   We--the Reuter family--overall think Sloane is up to no good.  I really felt sympathy for him for awhile, but I can't believe he led them into a Covenant safehouse.  In addition, we were completely fooled by Lauren's "love" for Vaughn when she set him free.  I can't believe that I was deceived by her; she is better at being double-faced than Irena ever was.    The one problem I had with this episode tonight was that no one informed Syd of Vaughn's kidnapping.  I was waiting for her to come and save the day, but she didn't.  I think it would have added to the plotline if she had to choose between saving Vaughn or her sister.  How all of the sudden did she wind up at the hospital at Vaughn's side?  I think that was too big of a gap to leave--I mean, no one even told her about him.  The previews for next week were ambiguous.  She was fighting with two other women--I don't know.  Until next week, I remain on the edge of my seat!

       "Move to Phase Two" --Sloane, Alias Season 2   No, my best friend wasn't mudered in her restaurant and doubled as part of Sloane's larger plan to destroy the Alliance.  Phase two for me will be taking medicine for the rest of my life to manage as my doctor said, "a serious thyroid problem."  I also have to get more bloodwork done in 2 weeks, and I have to get a ultrasound on my neck to check for nodules--hopefully, if any, are benign.  However, as a result of the medicine, my body should normalize in several ways.  I just hope my hair doesn't turn gray in my early twenties like Grandma Judy's did.  Hey, maybe I'll be that size 0 blonde yet ;)  Hablando del pelo, me choca el pelo corto.  Quisiera que el pelo fuera mas largo.  Aunque muchas personas me han dicho que les gusta el pelo, no estoy de acuerdo.  Quiero poder poner el pelo en una cola de caballo.  Será difícil para mi obra de baile en junio porque tendré que poner el pelo en un bollo.  Ahora, no puedo hacerlo.  No hay nunca que pueda hacer sobre este.  ¡Qué será, será!

       Sober Prom   I'm at school right now just hanging out in the library before spanish class.  We just had an ASB assembly for sober prom.  It was so cheesy that I think it is going to make people drink even more.  The little film from MADD (Mothers Ag ainst Drunk Driving) tried to portray these pitiful situations in which teens were killed or dramatically affected by alcohol.  It was just so unreal for a Catholic college prep school.  People were just laughing the whole time and whispering to their friends.  It was pretty sad. I think more thought needed to be put into it.  Maybe personal stories from the Mitty community--that would have made things more real.  At the end of the film, this representative from MADD said this whole thing how everyone in school can be positively or negatively affected by your actions and that they will all come to your funeral.  Huh?  I've concluded that that assembly was a total waste of time.  Anyhoo, I go to find out about my other blood test results this afternoon.  I'm kind of nervous and a little worried.  I'll post later to let ya'll know of the outcome.  Gotta go to class!  w

       A Restless Heart Looking For Peace   The past few months, I have had time to reflect and learn more about the person who I am with the most--myself.   I started out disgusted with who I had become.  We all have those fantasies and thoughts when we are younger of what we will be like when we're older.  I can still remember being about 10 years old, being so thrilled to have a double digit age.  It excited me so much of what high school and being a teenager were all about, though I still had a few years to be there.   But it was fun just imagining the possibilities and planning my future.  Now that I'm here--the whole teenager/high school realm--I'm not sure I  like it that much.  In fact, I am positive that most times it absolutely sucks.  And that scares me because as eager as I am planning for my future, I don't want to be disappointed again.  Is the rest of my life going to be like this?  I know that my problems in the big scheme of things seem insignificant to an onlooker,  but to me, this is all I know.  My life--right here, right now.  It is a big deal because as I see the days, months, and years passing ever so quickly, the more I desire for a better life.  And I am creating a better life.  But it seems like everything I am doing isn't satisfactory to me.  Maybe it's that I need to change my sights and goals, but I seriously don't think that the things I  am working for are that outlandish.  And while it has been hard learning that there's no such thing as perfection and that everything is not always black and white, shouldn't I only desire the best for myself?  But just those crucial realizations I have made--and there are many more--are great acheivements.  Some people live their whole life before realizing what I have already learned.   And for that I am blessed.  To have opprotunities to discover these things.  That in itself is a big accomplishment.  But I always want more...my heart is restless.

       Who? What?   Have you ever thought you've known someone, but only later find out that you have no clue who that person is?  I mean like really deep down.  I thought I knew everything about her--her greatest fears, uncertainties, and joys.  But things have been slowly changing.  She isn't the same--or maybe it's me who has changed dramatically.  But I don't think so.  It's one of those relationships that you imagine are for life, from wedding to funeral.  And it's scary that it's not what it will be in reality.  But who can say one way or the other?  Maybe we're just in a rocky stage, but it's hard to think that as a possiblity with some little devil in the back of your mind telling you otherwise.  I've been advised that my next step should be to talk to her.  But I'm sick of talk.  I guess I want a "quick fix," but that is obviously not reality.  I think I'm going to go to the gym to workout and think about it.  That always helps.  Anyhoo, I'm going to this spiritual enrichment thing at SMT tonite.  The topic is "Where the Human Meets the Divine."  Should be interesting.  For some HILARIOUS church humor,  urlLink click here

       Angel Megan?   Not quite.  I had my first detention today. A result of skipping class.  So I did janitor work for an hour, walking around the whole school with other deliquents picking up trash.  Those who know me on campus gasped when they saw me with plastic gloves and a trash bag.  Megan Reuter got detention?  As Erin said, "What a bad seed."  I prefer to think of myself as a good seed with a couple dead leaves on the stem.  I finish my detention on Thursday after school.  Yipee!  Get this.  Out of my three classes, I have 4 essays in the making.  Isn't that ridiculous?  Plus, an in-class Spanish essay on Thursday.  Thursday is going to suck.  Who knows?  Friday might suck even more.  I have my follow up doctor's appt. re: my thyroid.  Let ya'll know how that goes l8tr.

       Reuter Family Prediction   Alias was awesome tonite--like always.  We think that Lauren is pregnant, which, combined with some true love she might have for him, can explain the preview showing her trying to save him.  This will only complicate things for Vaughn and Syd in the 4th season.  Any other predictions?  Can't wait till next week!!!  3 episodes left :)

       Bookworm   So I went to Tower Records tonight to get the Thoroughly Modern Millie soundtrack.  That was fun.  Great cd, by the way.  INCREDIBLE show.  Anyhoo, after that, I wasn't ready to go back home, so I decided to drive across the street to Barnes & Noble.  I was almost done with my current book, Big Fish, and so I decided to get another book to read next.  I had read a lot of reviews and synopses about The Purpose-Driven Life, so I decided to check out the book and possibly buy it.   I read a little bit of the introduction that told what the book consists of and such.  Sounded good.  Before I bought it, I went to the magazine rack to buy the new Oprah  magazine for my mom.  While I was standing in line to buy it, I spotted an interesting sounding book called something like A History of Secret Societies.  The line was too long to jump out then get back at the end, so I admired it from afar.  Bought the book and the mag, both of which were under twenty dollars.  I also picked up a gift card for someone.   I decided that since I was having such a great time out on the town alone that I'd stop in the cafe and order a hot chocolate.  Did that and sat down to thumb through Oprah.  Like a good girl, I called my mom to check in and say that no one kidnapped me.  As I was talking to her, all of the sudden, I blurted out "F***!"  Heads around me turned and of course, my mom said, "What?!"  As graceful as a  ballerina, I totally knocked over my hot coco, causing it to create a  flowing river on the table cascading onto the chair.  Not only did it hit the table, but it splashed all over the window.  It looked like a bird crapped all over the window.  It was SO embarrassing; being in this posh, quaint cafe didn't help the situation either.  Not only did heads in the cafe turn to look, but I disturbed these old Italian men who were competing in backgammon games.  They muttered something in Italian and laughed.  *deep  breath, Megan*  Told my mom I had to go and cleaned up the mess.  What an adventure!  Anyhoo, tomorrow's plans (in no particular order): 1.  Outline ethics paper on abortion 2.  Go to gym 3.  Book Hawaii trip online con mi madre 4.  Babysit Paces (the Willow Glen tykes) @ 6pm 5.  Practice Wonder Woman and Jeffersons dances 6.  Start my purpose-driven life 7.  Relax?  (Seems fitting for #7)

       Latest Medical Update   Well.....more blood tests for Megan!  The previous blood test, everything was fine except for one thing:  my thyroid.  Yes, I have a low thyroid.  So, I had to get more bloodwork done to get the specifics of what exactly is wrong with my thyroid.  Results come in 10 days.    This is almost a relief that they found this problem because that explains a lot about my illness.  That the reason for my illness is my thyroid.  I am happy because it is like this is a simple answer to a once complex problem.  Hooray!  The only thing that worries me a little is what if it is thyroid cancer?  But my white blood cell count was normal...so that couldn't be it, right?  My Grandma Judy (the one in Grass Valley) took thyroid meds was she was younger, and my Grandma Charlotte (the one at church every Sunday) takes meds for that now.  Grandma Judy's hair turned gray when she was in her early twenties because of her thyroid, so all her life  she dyed her hair.  So I will definetly be taking some kind of a medication to regulate my thyroid after we get these next results back.  These current tests are just to pinpoint the specifics.  If you don't know a whole lot about the thyroid's function in the body, symptoms, etc, here are some helpful links:   urlLink WebMD Overview   urlLink Causes   urlLink What increases your risk   urlLink Treatment

       The Forgotten Land of Ice   "Antarctica, long neglected by industrialized nations as an aid-dependent "basket case," is finally on the economic upturn. This, due solely to the fact that Bruce Jovanovich of the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Program tripled his income by convincing superiors that his research into penguin migrations was a vital component in the war against terrorism. His raise, when averaged with the income of the 17 other scientists huddled in underground bunkers in this frozen God-forsaken wasteland, increased the per capita income of the continent by 22%.  Jovanovich has already invested his largess in the local economy by installing an open-air Jacuzzi from which to observe his penguin subjects. "Sometimes my binoculars get a little steamed up," said Jovanovich. "But it's worth it just to sit there in 105 degree water with the antarctic wind whipping through my hair! That invigorating sensation really helps me do a lot of science, which as we know is essential to stopping terrorism. God bless America. And also Antarctica."  Jovanovich's neighbors are somewhat less enthusiastic about their continent's economic boom. On condition of anonymity, one ice core analyst commented through chattering teeth, "Bruce is such a jerk. Now please excuse me while I massage some feeling back into my frostbitten extremities."   ___________________  Just to let ya'll know, this is not turning into any kind of politics blog, I just thought it was pretty funny.  Same with the last entry.  Hope no one was offended by the obscene language.  Anyways, in news about my life: Break has been very lax.  In a good way.  I have spent my time lounging in my pj's, only showering and getting dressed to go to the gym, doctor's appointments, and dance classes.  Tonight, however, I am seeing Thoroughy Modern Millie with my dance teacher and some other people at the CPA.  I am SOOOO excited.  It is like a big tap show!  Funstuff!  That will be the sole reason for me showering and getting dressed.  I should go to the gym, but we'll see what happens with that.  Tomorrow is my lunch date with Veronika.  I really like eating at Benson at SCU because the food is really delectable!  Makes me hungry just thinking about it!  Then I have a doctor's appt. to find out about my blood tests I had done.  I am a little scared about that.  I hope everything is fine and they don't find out anything else wrong with me :(  Oh...so Wonder Woman rehersal yesterday was INTENSE!  Seriously...every dancer in the room was about to pass out after going through the dance...and it's not even complete yet.  We learned this tricky new combination that is very intricate and quick.  Boy, oh boy!  There has been talk about performing at St. Martin's Fun Day...Gosh I hope not!  I am not very confident with all the moves yet.  And most likely the dance will not be finished by Fun Day...I hope.  I REALLY want to perform the Jeffersons though!  That is a fun, fun dance!  The five of us in our 'lil (or should I say HUGE) afros getting out groove on!  Hehehe.

       Hey Dumbass--Kerry For President     Quotes about current campaigning courtesy of  urlLink The Onion .  "The Bush people initiated this volley of negative ads, but we won't be lured into a reactive campaign against the Republicans," Kerry campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill said Monday. "It's time to redirect the cheap name-calling away from Bush and toward those Americans who might be idiotic enough to vote for him."  "In the past four years, America's national debt has reached an all-time high," the ad's narrator said. "And who's responsible? You are. You're sitting there eating a big bowl of Fritos, watching TV, and getting fatter as the country goes to hell. You ought to be ashamed of yourself."  Over a series of images of America's senior citizens, the narrator of another 30-second spot says, "The Medicare drug bill is a triumph of right-wing ideology masquerading as moderate reform. The pharmaceutical-drug and insurance industries are tickled pink. Guess who's paying for it? You. Congratulations, moron. I'm John Kerry and I approved this message."  "Are you going to vote for a candidate whose campaign promises would cost America $1.9 trillion over the next decade?" the ad asks. "Of course you aren't. You aren't going to vote at all. In the last election, half of you didn't even show up. So, on Nov. 2, just spend the day right there at your dead-end office job, talking to your coworkers about your new sweater and e-mailing your friends photos of your stupid 2-year-old daughter you shouldn't have had."  New direct-mail campaigns will solicit contributions with such slogans as "Fork over some of your paycheck to Kerry. Or are you too cheap?" and "One in 25 Americans donated money to a national political campaign in 2003. One in three Americans subscribed to cable television. Pathetic."  A positive conclusion: "Emotionally manipulative attack ads obscure the candidates' real positions and insult the intelligence of America's voters," Wayne said. "The fact that the major political powers are voicing their disdain for the public shows they are no longer hiding behind empty rhetoric. I see that as a positive step."

       Because I Compulsively Do These Things...   1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says: "ahoy--Used to hail a ship or person or to attract attention" (The American Heritage Dictionary) I wonder why they call them Chips Ahoy?  2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?: A glass globe paperweight that says Santa Clara University on the bottom.  3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?: Frasier.  One of the most hilarious shows on television.  It was the one where Frasier gets set up on a blind date with his ex-wife.

I think I  eat out too much.  Is that bad?  8: before you came to this website, what did you look at?: A website with endless varieties of afros.  Yeah, that's a sure sign I should  go to bed.  9: what are you wearing?: What a provocative question. A grey softysofty sweatshirt and pink leopard print undies. I prefer to look at it as "high school meets the amazon."  10: Did you dream last night? Very bizarre.  My street outside my house was was a river and I was playing tag in it with youth group people.  It was weird because everyone was just running on top of the water.  11: When did you last laugh? When I went to that name generator website like 15 minutes ago.  12: what is on the walls of the room you are in?: Old pictures of when Bobby and I  were young.

I become like a little kid when I'm there.  Gosh, I wish I was there right now.  18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?: i would make people think. that isn't something that is done too much anymore. oh yeah, and i'd make the bestest person in the world fall in love with me. whoever he is. but that's just selfish.  19: Do you like to dance?: it's my passion  20: George Bush: is a moron. but i went to this online game yesterday, it was quite funny. you got this retarded saying and you had to guess who said it... george bush or ralph wiggum. it was quite entertaining, and it makes a good point.  21: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?: i really like the name Leandra, Ella, Emma, but i just don't know.  Maybe I should base my decision on the name generator.  21: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?: Evan?  Again, i must consult the ng

       Movin' On Up   For tap this year, we  will be performing to the Jefferson's theme song.  We bought our costumes at Moon Zoom, this really creepy store on San Carlos.  In the dressing rooms, there is a sign posted that says, "We are watching you.  Shoplifting hurts everyone."  Riiiiight.  Anyhoo, we have to wear afros in this number  in our attempt to look, act, and dance like the black family.   I am supposed to be the father of the family.  Here is the afro I chose:     Can't you imagine it now?  It will look so flattering on me.  I just feel wierd like not having dark skin and wearing an afro.  It reminds me of Michael Jackson.  *shudder*  Anyhoo, it should prove to be an interesting performance.

       Alias-Reuterisms   Oh, how you would laugh when the Alias theme song comes on every week if you saw the Reuter family.  We have this thing--it is a little embarrassing--but we have a little dance to the song.  It is required that all Alias watchers in the room must perform the spastic actions.  There are different versions that everyone can do, but the movement is basically the same.  Whatever you do, you have to keep moving for those 27 seconds.  Everyone shakes their arms and legs up in the air and toggles their head.   Some remain on the furniture, while other more passionate members of the family get on their back on the floor and volitally wave their  arms, legs, and head.  When the music pauses at the end, everyone freezes in the position that they are in, and resume normal functioning when the comercial begins.  Every family does this, right?  And this is my own thing that I do.   I have the Alias soundtrack from season one.  When I listen to it in my car, I pretend that I am Sydney going on a mission.  I'm sure that that is quite normal too.   :)

       For Those Who Thought Christian Music Couldn't Get Any Weirder   Breakfast  Hold the milk, put back the sugar They are powerless to console We've gathered here to sprinkle ashes from our late friend's cereal bowl. Breakfast Clubbers, say the motto that he taught us to repeat: "You will lose it in your gym class if you wait `til noon to eat."   Back when the Chess Club said our eggs were soft every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft Oh, none of us knew his checkout time would come so soon But before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune:   WHEN THE TOAST IS BURNED AND ALL THE MILK HAS TURNED AND CAPTAIN CRUNCH IS WAVING FAREWELL WHEN THE BIG ONE FINDS YOU MAY THIS SONG REMIND YOU THAT THEY DON'T SERVE BREAKFAST IN HELL  Breakfast clubbers, drop the hankies. Though to some our friend was odd, that day he bought those pine pajamas his check was good with God.  Those here without the Lord, how do you cope? For this morning we don't mourn like those who have no hope  Oh, rise up, Fruit Loop lovers - sing out sweet & low With spoons held high we bid our brother, "Cheerio!"  ~The Newsboys

       Happy Easter   Contents of my basket: 3 boxes of Annie's pasta (my fav: Mild Mex, Cheddar, & Parmesan) $10 Jamba Juice card 5 fruit leathers (again, my favs: Wild Apple, Truly Tropical, Sweet Strawberry, Tangy Apricot, & Mucho Mango) 1 quotable magnet which says, "dance as though no one is watching you, love as though you have never been hurt before, sing as though no one can hear you, live as though heaven is on earth." 3 packs of Extra gum 1 blank notepad entitled,  "the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step."  Quite a healthy,  philosophical Easter Bunny this year!  Anyhoo, I'm thinking of writing my Ethical Dilemmas in Contemporary American Society paper on finding someone to go to prom with.  At least it will be an extra $110 in my pocket if I don't go.  *sigh*  Ayer, cuando fui al gimnasio, había mujeres desnudas que andaban alrededor.   En frente de toda la gente.  Y ellas pensaban que no haría nada inadecuada.  Tuvieron las sonrisas en sus carras como si todo fuera natural.  Era interesante...muy extraña.  Y un poco espantosa.

       Wonder Woman   I firmly believe that only Wonder Woman herself could execute the moves to her theme song that we are learning in dance.  Imagine this:  Hold: 1 2 3 4 Prep into Triple Pirouette into Gran Jeté down to floor:  &5 6 7 8 1 2 Stand up pose left, step right, layout left, down to floor: 3 4 5 6 Hold: 7 8 1 2 3 Rotate right, fall to splits,  spin around, roll up back: 4 5 6 7 8 Jump aravesc, prep into sodabasc, chassé, step, gran jeté:  1 2 3&4 5 6 7 8  ...and that is only about 20 secs of a 2 min 30 sec dance.

       I Still Believe   Can you still believe that it hurts me?   While it was almost a year ago, I still sit here with tears streaming down my face with Sheryl Crow's song "I Still Believe" playing in my head.  It still feels like it was just yesterday that I heard those painful words flow from your mouth.  To you, it was nothing--a walk in the park.  I feel like someone or something has turned my whole life upside down.  And there's nothing I can do about it.  I reach out, offer a smile, and friendly hello every once in a while.  I feel stuck and abandoned.  When I see you, I freeze and tremble.  It was so difficult for me today to give myself to God.  It was so hard.  It took all the strength inside of me to remain sane and refrain from bawling my eyes  out with you there.  But I'm glad you were there.     What is hanging on to this accomplishing? Nothing, because I know it will never be received and returned.   I'm asking for your friendship.  It's what you offered me so long ago and I screwed things up with my feelings.  Still, the closure I seek is not apparent.  I just don't know how to do this anymore, that is, living in this madness of reaching for  the unattainable.  You are like the wind to me--I feel you strongly but I can't grasp  you.   I don't know what to do.  It is just so painful  to me.  I can't take it anymore.  I feel like my heart has just been ripped out of me.  And I  don't blame you; for some reason, I am mad at myself.  And no one around me understands what a powerful impact you have had on my life, and for it to be instantly taken  away  left my face down in the dirt.   Please let me know that you forgive me for having my heart in the wrong place.  I just feel broken, and even after almost a year, I don't know how to put myself back together.  Gosh, I  hope you read this and understand that I'm talking to you.  I have had a strong inclination  to do something, and this is all I  can think of to do.  I miss you.  I'm sorry.  Truly.  "I Still Believe" ~Sheryl Crow Come to me now And lay your hands over me Even if it's a lie Say it will be alright And I shall believe  I'm broken in two And I know you're on to me That I only come home When I'm so all alone But I do believe  That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right It all comes down on me Please say honestly you won't give up on me And I shall believe And I shall believe  Open the door And show me your face tonight I know it's true No one heals me like you And you hold the key  Never again would I turn away from you I'm so heavy tonight But your love is alright And I do believe  That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right It all comes down on me Please say honestly You won't give up on me And I shall believe I shall believe

       Two Down, Two To Go!   I went to the Holy Thursday service last night.  It was wonderful!  I don't know why more people don't go because it is so powerful.  I love the washing of the feet; it is so touching.  After the service has ended, we process over to the community building illuminated with a myriad of white, warm, flickering candles.  It is so beautiful.   Then, a candlelit path is arranged throughout the grass outside the community building to walk, pray, and meditate.  It is really something to be enjoyed by everyone.  So if you didn't come this year, come next year!  Then I went to the Good Friday liturgy today.   Talk about long and drawn out.  3.5 hours of scripture readings and Harry Soza guitar hymns.  I did, however, enjoy it.  I just think it could be shorter.  Apparently there is a good reason for it being 3 hours because it has something to do with Jesus' suffering/death.  But not 3. 5  hours.   That was overboard.  I like how the cross is passed  overhead from section to section, and seeing all the hands--young, old, black, and white--touching and carrying it.  Tomorrow night is the Easter vigil, which excites me because I will actually be dancing instead of doing the incense.  Then Easter Sunday.  Then probably a nap.  I  am not quite sure what I am doing next week.  I have no school for Easter Break.  I am hoping to go to the beach one day with a  bunch of people.  And I definitely have to do research for my Ethical Dilemmas in Contemporary American Society paper.  Anyhoo, I have to go finish making ribbons for dancing at church.  ¡Chau!

       I Hate Everything About You  by Three Days Grace Well, I guess I am going to have to officially label Tuesday as "Song Tuesday" because for no apparent reason, I feel like posting songs today.  These are songs that I can really relate to.  My favorite part is how it shows the familiar paradox of loving someone and hating them at the same time.  That just clicks for me.  Again, this is a 104.9 song.  Every time we lie awake After every hit we take Every feeling that I get But I haven’t missed you yet  Every roommate kept awake By every sigh and scream we make All the feelings that I get But I still don’t miss you yet  Only when I stop to think about it  I hate everything about you Why do I love you I hate everything about you Why do I love you  Every time we lie awake After every hit we take Every feeling that I get But I haven’t missed you yet  Only when I stop to think about it  I hate everything about you Why do I love you I hate everything about you Why do I love you  Only when I stop to think About you, I know Only when you stop to think About me, do you know  I hate everything about you Why do I love you You hate everything about me Why do you love me  I hate You hate I hate You love me  I hate everything about you Why do I love you

       Love Song  by 311 If you've heard this song on the radio, you know how great it is.  It makes me think about past relationships in my life that have fallen apart.  If by some spectacular chance you have never heard this song, tune into 104.9, they play it all the time.  It is so simple, yet it says it all.  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am whole again  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am young again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again  However far away, I will always love you However long I stay, I will always love you Whatever words I say, I will always love you I will always love you  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am free again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am clean again  However far away, I will always love you However long I stay, I will always love you Whatever words I say, I will always love you I will always love you

       Dancing Queen, Young and Sweet Only Seventeen!   Well, soon to be seventeen anyway. Two things I am proud of about myself today at the gym: I jogged at an incline of 8.0 for 30 mintues on the treadmill, and I did a total on 100 reps on the thigh machine using 60 pounds.  This dancing queen is young, sweet, AND strong!  Which brings me to my next point.  Does anyone know what April 24th is? (Besides the 3 month countdown to my birthday).  Yes, you guessed it.  It's the highly anticipated Junior Prom.  I was pretty sure of who I was going to ask.  Yes, I was definetly sure.  Unfortunately, my friend beat me to him.  What is a dancing queen to do?   There's this other guy, let's call him "Dixon."  (hehe, got that one from Alias).  Dixon and I used to hang out a lot at school this year, until my schedule changed.  Now it's just a short Hello in the hallway.  But I'm just looking for a friend to go with.  Things will work out with someone somehow *fingers crossed*  I am so excited because I am going to be helping Señora Karazija with her spanish classes.  She was my teacher at SMT in junior high.  She was an inspiration to me, and I  feel totally blessed to be able to work along side of her.  Algún día debo escribir una entrada de Blog en español.  ¿Alguien conoce bien la idioma?  Pues, no puedo escribir ahora porque muchas personas me están charlando en AIM.  Hablaré más tarde.

       Nobody Does   Why am I awake at 7am on a Saturday morning?  The world may never know.  Anyways, I  am happy to report that liturgical dance practice went fine and the air has been cleared with Katie and Becky.  No worries.  My only complaint is that JW's sisters,  Helena & Elisabeth, are obnoxious little girls.  Or maybe it is fairer to say this:  they are completely odious at rehersals.  Sure they may appear sweet--I was once deceived too--but they have a problem acquiescing to an authority/leader figure.  Towards the end of the rehersal, I was so tired of their complaining and rude comments about not being able to dance with the older girls for By Cross & Water Signed, I found myself being extremely blunt with them.  *sigh*  Whatever, it's all over now.  Anyways, yesterday I had a doctor's appointment.  I had to get a Hepititus A shot by this butch nurse.  When she came in with the needle prepared and everything, I said, "Um, I don't really like shots"--you know, just to let her know that it is not a walk in the park for me.   She replies with, "Nobody does," and out of no where, just stabs this needle into my arm.  Gadzooks!  THEN, my doctor says I have to go downstairs and get some bloodwork done, which I've never had done before.  Okay...so my mom and I go downstairs, and they are closed for the next 45 minutes for lunch.  Fine.  We go to that KFC/Taco Bell on the corner of Naglee and Bascom because it is close by to grab a bite to eat.  That butch nurse who gave me my shot came in with this other nurse to grab lunch.  She gave me the most spooky, sly smile.  It was freaky.  And since my mom thought it was hilarious--the dialouge that happened surrounding the impromtu stabbing--she went over and started talking to her.  That's one  of those "Maaaaaaahm"  moments.  So we go back to get my bloodwork done.  Oh, by the way, it's that big yellow building on O'Connor Drive across from the elementary school entrance of St. Martin's.  Anyways, we walked right in and I go in the back room with this perky Asian nurse.  I told her I had never done this before and she was sweet, just because of the fact that she didn't stab me right then and there.  I began sitting up in a chair and I couldn't handle it.  Part of it was the nurse saying to the other nurse, "Where's the vein again?"  So they had me lay down.  Left arm: prick.no vein. prick. no vein. tears welling up in my eyes.  Right arm: prick. aha!  What a wild experience.  The only good thing is that I came home with about four different Looney Tunes character band aids on both arms.

       By Cross & Water Signed   Many of you already know that I am the liturgical dance coordinator at St. Martin of Tours.  This time of year gets very busy and exciting as we approach Triduum, and especially Easter.  Sunday night, I commenced the tedious, yet necessary, administrative preparation.  This includes calling 20 some-odd dancers--with that cute secretary voice-- and signing them up to dance for this coming Easter season.  I then created "Important Information" sheets for parents and their dancers about when we will be dancing and what to wear each Sunday.  *Deep breath*  Then, I throw together a sign-in sheet on the computer, asking for all their contact information and which masses they will be dancing at.  Tonight, the night before, I will be looking over choreography and planning a time schedule to adhere to at practice.  Sounds like a lot of work, right?    Here's my frustrating dilemma:  This program used to fall into the responsible hands of Katie and Becky.  Being in college, they have been extremely busy, which makes it hard to put a lot of energy into this fragile program.  Last fall, right before their immersion trip to Los Niños, they passed down the authoritative torch to me for good.  I gladly accepted the challenge.  I choreographed and coordinated a successful Advent season.  So, you might ask, What's your dilemma Megan?  I'm getting to it...  Katie sends me an e-mail this past week, after all my hard work, saying that she is planning to set up rehearsal soon and get the ball rolling.  Okay...I nicely reply that I am running a rehearsal on Friday, from 4-6pm in the church with the little kids and the older dancers.  Basically, the thesis of her next e-mail to me was, Well Becky and I weren't expecting you to do that.  She later says that she is happy she has that time off to come to the rehearsal to help run things.  Excuse me?  Isn't she the one who wanted out?  I'm the one doing all the work here and she just prances in last minute to make it look like she contributed?!  I'm definetely NOT okay with that!  I already have this rehearsal planned down to a science!  So again, I politely respond that I am confused about my role in this process and that I thought she and Becky were trying to get out of this commitment to pursue other goals at  urlLink SCU .  I said that I felt like I was doing all this work and they were just popping in and out whenever.  Then I said that that was fine, but I just needed clarification.  No reply yet.  Oh, by the way, they are only going to be there for the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday.  Not for the whole Easter season.  I feel like I am in charge of this ministry and that they are being arrogant by trying to stick there heads in every once and a while to check in on me.  Not ok!  I do like control.  Maybe part of that is why it frustrated me that she would try to push herself to being in charge.  But I enjoy leading this ministry and I work hard to keep it going.  Maybe it is pride...maybe even arrogance on MY part.  Either way, I have to communicate my feelings because that is the way I feel, and I don't believe there's a wrong or a right way to feel.  One just has to feel whatever he/she is feeling and express it...  Thank God for blogs!  ;)

       Back   Outlets were fun.  I got two new scandulous(but mother approved)-fluffy-fun skirts.  Yay for me.  At Tahoe Joe's, we had a camarero apuesto.  He showed me that my heart can still flutter, and that was refreshing.  But he was just the object of infatuation (oh, did I  mention he was like 25?).    I can't deny true love.  I don't use the word love very lightly.  So it's important to me...  Feeling pretty bleh today for a million reasons, but one in particular. I present to you, an ode to love:  Artist: Sheryl Crow Album: Tuesday Night Music Club (great cd, btw)  Song: Strong Enough   God, I feel like hell tonight Tears of rage I cannot lie I'd be the last to help you understand Are you strong enough to be my man?  Nothing's true and nothing's right So let me be alone tonight Cause you can't change the way I am Are you strong enough to be my man?  Lie to me I promise I'll believe Lie to me But please don't leave, leave, don't leave  I have a face I cannot show I make the rules up as I go So try and love me if you can Are you strong enough to be my man?  When I've shown you that I just don't care When I'm throwing punches in the air When I'm broken down and I can't stand Would you be man enough to be my man?  Lie to me I promise, I'll believe Lie to me But please don't leave   And this song too: I Shall Believe  Come to me now And lay your hands over me Even if it's a lie Say it will be alright And I shall believe  I'm broken in two And I know you're on to me That I only come home When I'm so all alone But I do believe  That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right It all comes down on me Please say honestly you won't give up on me And I shall believe And I shall believe  Open the door And show me your face tonight I know it's true No one heals me like you And you hold the key  Never again would I turn away from you I'm so heavy tonight But your love is alright And I do believe  That not everything is gonna be the way You think it ought to be It seems like every time I try to make it right It all comes down on me Please say honestly You won't give up on me And I shall believe I shall believe

       Love Actually   Just got done watching that movie.  It was really great.  For any of you who have seen it, I think that I relate most to the little boy.  I just wish I had his courage to express my love like that.  He was truly an amazing little guy.  Except I think that girl was a bit too old for him, but I guess it goes to show love conquers all, even age.  I wish it were true for my situation, although age is not the concern.  Whatever.  It scares me how long my heart has been aching.  Is it love?  I'd say so, but in my case, it is unconquerable.  I am officially launching Mission Move On.  I will keep you posted on its progress.  Anyways, I really liked the song from the movie by Kelly Clarkson.  Here it is:  Love can be a many splendored thing Can't deny the joy it brings A dozen roses, diamond rings Dreams for sale and fairy tales It'll make you hear a symphony And you just want the world to see But like a drug that makes you blind, It'll fool ya every time  The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride The trouble with love is It doesn't care how fast you fall And you can't refuse the call See, you got no say at all  Now I was once a fool, it's true I played the game by all the rules But now my world's a deeper blue I'm sadder, but I'm wiser too I swore I'd never love again I swore my heart would never mend Said love wasn't worth the pain But then I hear it call my name  (The trouble with) The trouble with love is It can tear you up inside Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride The trouble with love is It doesn't care how fast you fall And you can't refuse the call See, you got no say at all  Every time I turn around I think I've got it all figured out My heart keeps callin' and I keep on fallin' Over and over again The sad story always ends the same Me standin' in the pourin' rain It seems no matter what I do It tears my heart in two  (The trouble with love is) The trouble with love, yeah (It can tear you up inside) It can tear you up inside (Make your heart believe a lie) Make your heart believe a lie It's stronger than your pride  (The trouble with love is) It's in your heart It's in your soul (doesn't care how fast you fall) You won't get no control (and you can't refuse the call) See, you got no say at all  (The trouble with love is) Oh, yeah (It can tear you up inside) (Make your heart believe a lie)

       Kiss Me Kate   Kudos to Vaci, Bobby, Katie, and Becky for a truly splendid performance tonight!   All the dancing and music was excellent!  Hooray!  I totally recommend to everyone to go see it.  It's at  urlLink SCU .  After the  show, Bobby, Vaci, Aniko, my mom, my dad and I went to Denny's for a post-party celebration.  The Moons Over My Hammy was to die for and Mr. Moons was hilarious.  For those of you not familiar with The Moons, it is an egg, cheese, and ham sandwhich that is served with hashbrowns.  It is the best meal ever!  Yum!  And Mr. Moons is Bobby and Vaci's friend waiter (they are frequent diners at Denny's) who says Moons with a funny accent.  Anyways, this has turned out to be a pretty boring entry because I can't sleep and have nothing better to do.  Yuck, I really need to go to bed.  That 8am yoga class doesn't  look  like it's going to be happening :)

       I'm Obsessed   First of all, just a side note:  it scares me that I had to look up how to spell "obsess."  It just doesn't look right to me.  Sometimes it scares me that I'm writing a novel.  Anyways, I don't like that I am interested in so many things.  My mom says that that makes me an interesting person.  But I don't want to be interesting--just intelligent and beautiful.  When someone asks you to describe Megan Reuter, I want to be depicted as only a few adjectives with only a few passionate interests.  So here's the "interesting" me that I'm not sure I like: I enjoy dancing, fiction novels, writing, going to cafés, listening to different types of music, seeing musicals, babysitting, yoga, Spanish, teaching, singing, acting, attending church, kayaking, painting, traveling, playing The Sims, designing web pages, blogging, etc...the list goes on.  I tried to find a common thread that unites all these activities together.  To be that one powerful descripter of Megan Reuter.  Artsy?  Creative?  Fun-loving?   Interesting?  Yikes, I just don't know anymore.  I can't even describe myself.  Now that scares me.

       I Hate Valley Fair   I like Valley Fair because it has a variety of shops that appeal to my taste and style.  It is also an interesting, air-conditioned place to hang out during the maddening heat of summer.  However, the cons overwhelmingly outweigh the pros.  Especially today.  After doing lunch with my mom at The Old Spaghetti Factory and getting fingerprinted for my Vacation Bible Camp position, I decided to drive over to Valley Fair.  I was hot and cranky and the mall tends to be cool and peaceful.  So I went there hoping to reverse my mood and to buy a yoga mat and strap (long-needed).    I always park in the same parking garage and the same level.  This time was no different; I parked, entered the mall, window shopped for a bit, bought my yoga gear, and decided to head on home.  Except there was one problem:  I was lost.  I had no clue where I was and where the correct parking garage was from my location.  I  wandered aimlessly for several minutes before I spied a security guard.  I thought,  Okay, Megan, just ask him where the garage you parked in is...No, it's not weird, he won't think you're too dumb .  The encounter carried out like this:  M:  Excuse me.  I seem to be lost.  Do you know where the parking structure walkway to the roof by Macy's is from here? SG: Which Macy's?  Men's or women's? M:   (Crap.  I have no clue.)   Umm, I'm not quite sure.  I just know I saw Express when I came in. SG:  There's a  men's Express and a women's Express.  Which one was it? M:   (CRAP!)   I didn't seem to notice. SG:  Well, which street did you turn in from?  Monroe?  By Forest Avenue?  Between the two banks? M:   (How am I supposed to know?)   Umm, I don't know. SG chuckles and says:  Well, young lady.  You don't seem to know much of anything. M:  (Wow,  I'm thoroughly embarrassed!)   You know what?  I think I can handle it from here.  Thanks anyways.   Sure enough, I found the walkway--much later as I hobbled from the blisters my expensive Gap shoes inflicted on my pinky toes.  For future reference, I noted that it was by both the  women's  Macy's and Express.  In conclusion, I hate Valley Fair because it is simply too big.  And confusing.  And I don't like it.

       Deep Drifts   That's the title of my novel in progress.  Yes, that's right, Megan is writing a novel.  Writing has been one of my secret talents over the years.  I bet most of you didn't know that I've won first place in two essay contests (and have submitted two more to win scholarships for college), have had a poem published, and have been told by all of my English teachers that I have the natural gift of eloquence.  So, that's why I have added the "Currently Studying" section to my right column.  I just went to the café today (hence the new name of my blog) and outlined my plot, complete with all the components I have studied about: setup, rising action, reversals, recognition, climax, falling action, and denouement.  Pretty neato, eh?  The only element of my story (which is different than a plot, I have learned)that I can fill you all in on is that the main character's name is Ava Flom.  That will just have to satisfy your inquisitiveness for now.  Back to the old writing board...

       Season Finale   Wow...I am almost speechless.  The season finale of Alias was AWESOME.  Like over- the-top-screaming-in-awe awesome.  My mom, dad,  and I were screaming at the top of our lungs when Lauren wasn't dead and started to get up as Sydney and Vaughn were kissing.  Then Vaughn took her out for good (we hope).  I want to know what happened to Marshall.  Poor, poor Marshall--he really didn't deserve that.  Not at all.  And the whole mask thing was really gut wrenching.  Knowing who was who and that kind of thing.  I totally knew that it was Syd with Lauren's mask and voice modifier in the cell next to Sark.  They wouldn't just put those two right next to each other in jail, allowing them to conspire.  So now we wait until bleeping January 2005 to find out unanswered questions and what was in the top secret document at the end.  I'm still hoping that if enough people complain to ABC, we might not have to wait in anguish that long.  *fingers crossed*

       He Sure Loves Me   Tickets for my annual dance show at the CPA in June went on sale this morning.  To be exact, 8am.  However, my dad got to my dance studio at 2:30am to stand in line.  And yes, there was already a line.  Isn't that crazy?  Gosh, these parents sure love their little dancers.  By the by, I don't know the actual catchy title, but the theme of the show has something to do with TV.  I don't know if I've mentioned that before, but I guessed with my dance numbers named "Wonder Woman," "The Jeffersons," and "Bonanza," I thought you would've guessed.  In other news, I am going to see the movie  urlLink Mean Girls  this afternoon.  It has gotten really  great reviews and I really like Lindsay Lohan (mostly from her Disney days and The Parent Trap).  I'll report back my own review later.  If I don't give my review today, it's because I was too tired and had to take a nap before going to babysit my little Willow Glen Brats tonight.  Fun!

       Act Now   According to the  urlLink San Jose Mercury News , Alias is not in the ABC fall line-up.  It will start up again in January 2005.  OMG!  If you're as pissed off as I am (even if you're not), PLEASE e-mail ABC telling them they made a huge mistake!    Here is the e-mail address:  netaudr@abc.com   UPDATE:   This was the response to my e-mail to ABC: _________________________________ Thanks for your note about the ABC TV Network Fall Schedule for 2004 and the show, "Alias."  The show will be returning in January 2005 at its regular Sunday timeslot with absolutely no repeats through the end of the year.  We appreciate your interest in ABC TV network programming! __________________________________  Boy, oh boy!  I am infuriated.  I was expecting an e-mail like this:  Thanks for your note about the ABC TV Network Fall Schedule for 2004 and the show, "Alias."  Due to your concern and many other viewers', ABC's plans have changed.  Alias will return in Fall 2004 at their regular Sunday timeslot.

       Crap   That's what my car smells like.  Baby crap in an old diaper in a plastic trash can next to a changing table.  Those of you who have/had babies or babysit know what particular stench I speak of.  I thought it would be cute/fun (and other generic words) to get the Baby Powder scent in my car when I got it washed at the Boat Car Wash on Hamilton.  BIG MISTAKE.  Instead of a nice powdery, fluffy scent, it reeks of aged feces.  My weapon of choice: Febreeze.

       Oh, Grand-ma-ma!   I am going to be brutally honest.  Sometimes I would like to strangle my grandmother--not in a cold-blooded murderer way, but in more of a figurative way.  She is constantly annoying; it is like a  perpetual mannerism with her, and it is so irritating.  Irritating to the point of insanity.  Here's how our conversation went when I got home from school: M: Hi Grandma. G: Hi honey, how are you? (Gosh, I HATE when she calls me baby names) M: Fine.  Would you like to go out to lunch? (Asking out of feeling some strange obligation) G:  Oh, I have so much ironing dear.  (OKAY, really, my name is Megan) M: Are you sure?  You know you don't have to do all this today. G: Oh, sure I do (saying it in her recalcitrant way).  It's my job. (By the way it's not, she just feels obligated because we give her money each month to live on) M: Okay.  Well I'm going to go out to lunch myself then. G: Bye honey, be careful. (door closes)  I come back home after Elephant Bar and Santanna Row and she is standing by the screen door, peering outside with her coat on, her purse in hand, and her miscellaneou (sp?) black bag.  G:  Where have you been?  I've been waiting for you! (She exclaims in her sweet, prying grandma way) M:  You don't have to wait for me.  I do have a key, you know. G:  Well I got worried.  I thought you were just going to lunch. (I'm thinking--Grandma!  I am almost 17, have my own car, and am self-sufficient, PLEASE, I don't need a babysitter) M:  Would you like me to give you a ride down to the bus stop? G:  No, I'll walk (she says in her pitiful voice like if I ask her again, she might take me up  on the offer) M:  Okay, well see you later.  Bye, grandma. (door closes)  Now some of you may think I'm being over-critical.  She is not a complete sour apple all the time.  She is a wonderful old woman, but as she ages, she seems to get more and more on my nerves.  For example, I tell her that I don't want her to bring me fatty foods and candy every week for me because I like to eat healthy things.  She says Okay.  But every week she brings candy and swings the bags of gummy bears right in front of my nose, talking in a tempting voice like I am a baby.  Also, since she can't see that well, she has been smearing the writing on my shirts when she irons.  I asked her several times nicely to not iron those shirts anymore, and she continuely does!  And she excuses herself by saying, "Oh, you don't want to go out looking all wrinkled, do you?"  AAAHHHH!  I'm going out of my mind with this lady!  But I continue to be nice.  As you see in the conversation above, there were many times when I could have blown up at her.  So I'm not that terrible of a granddaughter, am I?

       Will You Be My Playmate?   Teehee.  I started out watching the movie Ransom with Mel Gibson on tv, but found it too disturbing.  As I continued surfing, I came upon the Playboy 50th Anniversary Special on tv.  Hmmm...interesting...okay.  I stopped at that channel only because they were showing Kelsey Grammer and I absolutely adore Frasier.  And then I was hooked. I learned that my misguided thoughts of Playboy being some slutty, crude, pornographic corporation are completely incorrect.  While I do think that Hugh Hefner should be retiring soon, I do commend him for running such a vast empire into his senior years.  No matter what company, managing is tedious and difficult (I sound like I own a company and know what I am talking about).    Here's some things I learned.  Playboy publications are distributed all over the world in many (I failed to remember the exact number) different languages.  However, in China, distribution of these publications are banned.  Hmm...interesting.  Also, the girls who are the "playmates" are really nice.  Seriously.  I pictured some stuck-up whores who smoke and have bags under their eyes.  But these girls  have proved me wrong.  A lot of them attend prestidgious (sp?) universities like Harvard, they have down to earth personalities, and seem to be the type of girls that a man wouldn't mind bringing home to meet the 'rents.  One thing that does amaze me, however, is that these young girls--full of potential--are interested in having sex with Hugh--a hobbling, saggy skinned man in his 70s.  Truly, I think these gorgeous, intelligent girls could do a lot better.  At the party, the girls were all huddled around Hugh dancing and nibbling on his ears, when there are hundreds of dashing, charming princes standing with lonely tears in the corner.  It is just a mystery to me.  Hugh is the peak definition of a chick magnet.  Next, I tried to picture myself as one of those girls running around in the little bunny suits.  I thought it might be fun for a day, and then out loud said to myself a stern No.  It was the kind of No that when voiced aloud, the little voice inside your head says, What the hell are you thinking, *insert your name here*?!  With that, I turned off the tv.

       Dream On Honey   As most of you all know, I love planning for the future.  I've always planned on getting a new car when I graduate from college and trading in my little 1999 Honda Civic.  It's truly a great car, but in 6 years (senior in  urlLink high school  to 4 year  urlLink college  to graduate credential program) I think I will be tired of my little car.   Something about getting a new car seems symbolic to me--like a fresh start, a new begining.  So, I have my  urlLink dream car  and my  urlLink realistic car .  Most likely I would get another Honda because they are reliable and cute little machines.  But I'd get a new one.  When I rode in Frosty's  urlLink Hybrid , I really liked it.  Plus, it's  urlLink good  for the  urlLink environment .  It also has pretty good  urlLink reviews .    But for now, I truly love my Civic.  It is fun to drive, gets good gas mileage, is easy to park, and is just pretty darn cute.  I think I'm going to go give it a little shower right now.  Adios.

       The Old Church   The old church leans nearby the well worn road Upon a hill that has no grass or tree. The winds from off the prairie now unload The dust they bring around it fitfully.  The path that leads up to the open door Is worn and grayed by many a toiling feet Of us who listen to the Bible lore And once again the old time hymns repeat.  And every Sabbath morning we are still Returning to the altar waiting there. A hush,  a prayer, a pause, And the voices fill the master's house With a triumphant air.  The old church leans awry and looks quite odd, But it is beautiful to us and God.  --Stephen Paulus

       Camp Creation   Well, it's official.   I will be leading one of two groups of campers who have completed Kindergarten at  urlLink St. Martin's  Vacation Bible Camp.  The theme is  urlLink Camp Creation .  And I have chosen our class name to be Butterflies.  I figured boys at that age wouldn't mind having a girly class name.  And besides, being the Butterflies is cute for little kids.  I am so excited!!  I already have so many ideas.  Since the theme has to do with camping, I can have a tent in my classroom where we read or pray inside.   And I can make wall murals of rustic scenery and hang them on the walls.  And the kids can make a class poster to hang on the door for the week.  Woohoo!  I am so ready.  Well, I'm off to go study for my Spanish final--I have the written (5 paragraph essay :l ) and the oral tomorrow.  Wish me luck!

       The Last 20 Pages   So I have about twenty pages left in  The Lovely Bones  (see left column).  They are the hardest last pages to read.  It's not like the book is horrible; in fact, it is quite excellent.   I just always get interrupted.  Like I went to the doctor the other day and purposely got there about 15 minutes early so that I could finish the book.  2 minutes after I got there, the receptionist says, "Oh, she can take you early right now."  Great!  Last night I hop in bed, so serious that I was going to finish the book.  I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Reading in bed is a bad idea for me.  Then this morning in my Ethics class, I finished this silent activity worksheet thingy and decided I was going to try to finish the book.  Other people finished the sheet too, and started laughing and talking really loud.  I could not concentrate.  I  found myself skimming a lot of it because of the noisy environment, so I stopped reading.  I really wanted to savor those last pages of the book.    Right now, the house is quiet.  I'm all alone.  Here I go...wish me luck!

       Skin at the Gym   I went to the gym today, like any other Monday.  I usually go about 3-4 times per week, plus my 2 dance classes each week.  Anyways, I did the usual 15 minute stretch, 30 minutes running on the treadmill, then 30 minutes resistance training.  I hate going to the gym later in the day because it is always so crowded.  When I was done with my workout, I went into the locker room to get my stuff, and there was this voracious, flabby Mexican woman just walking around naked.  That's right, no clothes.  Does that seem strange to anyone?  I mean, I've seen this kind of thing before in the locker room, and I guess it might be normal at a gym, but it was still  disturbing.  It's not like she had anything to show off.  So she walks completely naked across the locker room to go weigh herself (as if she is going to be that much lighter without her clothes on).  She says, "Hmm," which caused me to almost burst into laughter--I don't know why, you just had to be there.  Then she jumps in the shower and rinses off.  I bet you're thinking--How does Megan know these intricate details about every move she made?  Well, partly because she failed to close the shower curtain.  And it's not like I was staring--she was pretty hard to miss.  Here's probably the most disgusting part:  She gets out of the shower, doesn't dry off, and walks back toweless to her locker.  She sits down wet and naked on the bench.  OMG!  How gross is that?  Never again will I put my water bottle and music thingy on the bench while I'm situating my locker.  Some people even put the towels that they wipe their faces with on this bench while they are grabbing a drink of water.  I am completely grossed out.  COMPLETELY.

       Que Me Quedes Tu   A veces--además, mas veces que menos--te odio.  Es triste, yo sé, pero para siempre nunca dudaba que te habría odiado un día.  Lo empezó cuando fuimos a la misma escuela.  Yo quisiera que fuéramos amigas mejores para siempre y un día, pero no es realidad.  Y finalmente, pienso que estoy bien con esta situación.  Estoy moviéndome...

       So Many Choices   I went to the college fair out at Mission College tonight.  It was pretty good.  We got there right when it opened to avoid the crowds, only to find that everyone else was thinking the same thing, thus ironically creating a mob of hot sticky bodies bumping into each other's purses while milling about.  It was like Disneyland in the summertime without the characters prancing around.  Good thing my dad was there to carry my bag filled with jumbles of papers and folders from various colleges trying to sell themselves.  I felt annoyed by some of the representatives who acted like obnoxious car salesmen.  I think it makes for a poor representation of their organization and is a total turn-off to prospective students like myself.  Nonetheless, the evening went well overall.  After that, we went out to Apple Bee's to dinner because my parents, who are on Weight Watchers, wanted to see their new Weight Watchers inspired menu.  Disappointingly, it had not been issued yet.  But they still had some good, healthy food for them to gorge themselves with.  Since it was near sundown, there was an unbearable reflection piercing my eyes.  I politely aksed the waitress, a woman in her mid-twenties who owned an acne infested face worse than any teenager I know, if she could put down the adjacent blinds.  She huffed and puffed trying to release the stubborn blinds into their resting position, but to no avail, she had to call the manager.  He couldn't get them down either.  Then people from the surrounding tables got up to try; again, no success.  Embarrassed for asking such a troublesome request of the waitress, I sank down into the booth and hid behind my sunglasses, with eyes tearing from the scorching sun's relentlessness.  Then I came home.  Thumbed through the college info, taking notes and discussing things with my parents.  When I got tired of that, I turned on the season finale of Friends (eyes teared once again).  And now I sit here.  Telling you about my day.  The end.

       There Aren't The Words   I could say that it's sad or tragic, but those descriptors are too mundane.  In fact, I feel guilty even saying those words.  They don't seem to really capture the whole emotion, and I don't know if there are words that would.  I felt an uncontrollable fear inundate my veins when I was told that Anne Marie is planning JW's funeral.  The cancer is rapidly spreading through his brain stem, and doctors claim that there is no intervention possible--be it radiation or surgery.  In others words, everyone is losing hope; that is, everyone except the one person I most expected to drown in fear and hopelessness--JW himself.  He says that he still has hope, and that he is waiting for God to transcend His miraculous healing powers over him.  That just left me dumbfounded, that at this stage of regression in his illness, he is so optimistic.  I mean, that is totally an excellent mindset, and I don't mean to be pessimistic.  I've just tried to imagine what it would be like to be in his shoes--how I would feel and if I would exhibit the same relentless courage.  And sadly, I know I wouldn't.  I don't think I have it in me.   But who knows how I would feel if I was in the same situation.  I guess it's one of those things that you don't really know until you're there.  Situations like this one compels me to put things in my life into perspective, I mean, really relating petty ocurances in my life to the "grand scheme of things."  Most of the things that worry me, frustrate me, anger me, whatever me, are nothing compared to what JW and his family must be struggling with.  So I step back, take a deep breath, and look at things in a different light.  At least that's what I try to do.

       Me, Myself, and Chicken   Haha...get it?  Like that outlandishly crude film "Me, Myself and Irene."  Anyhoo...  I was going to tell you about how on Sunday, between dancing at the 8:30 and 10am, I spilt hot chocolate on my white dancing outfit and drove 55 mph back to church cursing until I got Amanda to change clothes with me because she was only going to dance at the 8:30, but I decided it wasn't worth it because you all already know what a clumsy dancer I am.  I like going out to eat at restaurants by myself.  About 2 months ago, I would never have entertained the idea for fear of people chanting and gesturing "welcome to Loser-Loner Land population 1, YOU."  Remember that from grade school?  But I've now concluded that I honestly don't care.  In fact, I find it comforting dining alone.  And I don't feel stupid or out of place whatsoever.  I went to The Elepahant Bar for lunch today and got the crispy chicken tenders platter.  Sometimes I just have an intense craving for the juicy chicken dipped in mouth-watering honey mustard sauce.  So I decided to cowtow to my penchants (hehe, that's a fun sentence to throw at a dense person!).  I just dislike when I go up to the hostess (no, not the cupcake) and she asks if I am meeting someone.  What, just because she doesn't have the audacity to dine by herself doesn't make it wrong for the rest of us confident go-getters.  I feel nauseous when people are "afraid" to do things on their.  Sometimes--only occasionally--will I have a speck of  compassion for someone like that because I was once like them.  For a paradigm (can you tell we are in the "p" section of our vocab books in school?), David and I will be sitting in the cafeteria, and he is afraid to walk 10 feet to go buy food because he is terrified of being seen alone.  What a loser!  He is so unconfident.  I used to have compassion for him in those situations, but now I'm just fed up.  I have decided to not feed his insecurities by walking with him to get food; after all, he's a big boy, he can do it!  At this point in the story, my dad would say to me again, "Megan, you're going to have boys," which infuriates me so much.  He says this because he thinks I am a tough drill lieutenant.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with boys, especially Alexander Knapen, whose perpetual cuteness will turn into being a hot teenager someday.  Not that I care if someday my children mature from cute to hot.  But I can always tell with little boys if they will be hot when they are older.  Sadly, most of them will not be because of unattractive parents who should have never procreated in the first place.  I plan to be one of those attractive women who marries the opulent, dashing gentlemen.  And if I don't turn out good, and least my well-endowed husband can fertilize me with his above-average sperm.  Oh my, see what happens when I let my boundless imagination run wild?  So, in conclusion, I deliver some words of advice to everyone:  You are not the center of the universe and no one will think twice about you eating alone because they are too self-involved with searching for their own Midas/millionaire mujer and figuring out their own lives, so grow some confidence and get out there!

       Still Uneasy   I went to get an ultrasound of my thyroid yesterday.  Thank God my mom came because I was very anxious.  So we went back to this dark room--my mom, a technician, and I.  I had to put on a gown and lay on this more-comfy-than-my-bed table.  Seriously, it had like a feather pillow.  Very nice.  Anyways, the tech put this warm jelly on my neck and started the procedure.  Throughout the whole time--about 30 minutes--I had to lift my chin up and refrain from swallowing.  I had like a pool of saliva in my mouth because I couldn't swallow (I'm sure that's more than you wanted to know).  Anyways, she showed me a black and white picture of my thyroid, which was actually larger than I thought--well, maybe that's the problem.  And then she switched the screen to color and explained to me that all the red and blue squiggly things running amuck were my antibodies attacking my thyroid.    I guess the deal is that I have a low thyroid, which means it is not producing enough hormones that it needs to.  Usually, a person's antibodies compensate for that low level, but mine are compensating too much, going overboard to be attacking my thyroid.  This is a condition called "hypothyroidism."  Then this lady scares me because as she moves the apparatus around on my neck, she is making "ho's" and "hum's" like  she is seeing something interesting--out of the ordinary.  She informs me that my lymph glands are also very swollen, which are the culprits for causing my horrible sore throat recently.  She said that it could mean many things, but as a technician, she is not permitted to give medical advice.  Therefore, as the title says, I am "still uneasy."  What happens next:  I get another blood test on Friday to see how/if this thyroid medicine I've been taking is effective.   Then I meet with Dr. Stein for those blood results and the ultrasound results.  I'll keep ya'll posted on what happens!  :)

       "I hate you, but I love you. It's like I want to push you off a cliff and run down to the bottom to catch you."   Laser tag was fun.  My code name was SpreadEagle.  Teehee :)  My "friends" (with the exception of Danielle) are all jerks to me.  It's not what they do, it's what they don't do.  They are completely self-absorbed with no regard of another person.  They always just talk about themselves.  There is no such thing as a meaningful conversation with them.  They all live in a world of school and books with no spice in life.  Is it torture for them to maybe ask how I'm doing and show some kind of interest in me?  What the hell is wrong with these people?!  They're in their own shell and live on false happinesses.  They love to appear like well-rounded, perfect, "got-it-together" people, but they aren't.  They are show-offs and arrogant, pompous individuals.  How the hell did I ever get connected with them?  I felt invisible tonight.  Worthless.  The laser tag made up for it.  And the Togo's sandwiches.   Yum.  Okay, enough bitching for one nite.

      Big hug to Danielle...Sorry things didn't work out hon :(  Remember weird Stalker boy from Bible Camp?  I just realized that I didn't follow through with what happened with him.  He actually turned out to be amazingly sweet and kind.  And funny.  I finally found out his name is Andrew.  Monday he kept eyeing me and smiling and said "hello Megan" in a dashing voice and nervous eyebrows.  Tuesday--same story.  Wednesday, he leaves his duty post to talk to me for a half an hour.  Easy to talk to.  Easy to relate to.  And he's intelligent.  Great plus.  And so my heart flutters.  I was excited and scared at the same time.  Wow, my heart still works!  But then overshadowing that realization was Wow, last time my heart got trampled.  Do I even want to consider opening its doors again?  The struggle between the good and evil truths of my mind were gut wrenching.  I was moving on.  I felt I had my feet put back on the ground, but only to be swept away by another charming young prince.    Thursday was akward.  I was still thinking and feeling my way through this inner conflict.  Friday was aweful.  Somehow, my mind was set on this station:  If I just give him the cold shoulder, I can forget we got to know each other better and forget the feeling I felt when he smiled at me.   In other words, I denied our chemistry and connection.  I am left with the feeling of being emotionally parched.  I smothered my feelings and pretended they were invalid.  And for that, I am angry.  Angry at myself.  I always screw things up.

      The dance recital was a huge success!!  And the best part was that my 3 favorite friends showed up (well I knew one of them was going to be there).  So the latest news is that I am not working anymore at that CPA-Law firm.  And no, I was not fired.  I quit.  Because of good reasons too.  Usually when I think of people quitting, I see them as weak individuals.  But just as Syd tells Sark in season 2 of Alias, "Just so you know, I am fully strong."  lol.  Remember that one?  When Sloane was replaced by Geiger?  I am giving Danielle publicity  urlLink for her new xanga!   Go there!  Read it!  Love it!  BTW: Your visual backstage pass to my dance recital coming soon!

      Tomorrow is my dance recital (TV theme).  While I am excited to be performing at the CPA again, I am also disappointed that I'm only in three numbers this year:  Wonder Woman, The Jeffersons, and Bonanza.  Rehersal is from 9am-3pm.  The show starts at 6:30pm.  I am glad that my Grandma Judy and Uncle Steve are coming to see me (along with the usual crew).  It will also be a sad show because it is my good friend Annie's last show.  She's going to college in Indianna (Notre Dame).  She has been in a total of 44 dances--not including this year.  An amazing dancer and wonderful person, I will truly miss her.  Well, I must go complete the finishing touches on my costume (elastic, velcro, etc).  Actually it's more like I have to cheer on my mom as she rushes to finish these last minute tweeks.  Then later today I have to go to the retarded vacation bible camp mass.  I'm only going because I need my 25th hour of community service.  Then I'm done for next year!

      My titles used to be witty.  But my creative mind has been lacking the virtue witty.  Most of them sound stupid.  So until my wittiness returns, I'm banishing all titles from my entries.  Anyhoo, camp was interesting today.  We played hangman this morning.  First word: love.  After they guess the word, they sculpt their clay to represent the word.  Sounds like a great activity, right?  Until I ruin it by saying:  "Okay, now you can make love with your play-dough."  Oh, the scandulous phrases that just seem to slip out!  I'm changing the subject to courage.  Something which I once lacked but now realize I have developed.  I am debating whether to act upon something, and it is driving me nuts.  Then I think of the quote: "Good things come to those who wait."  Okay, so I won't act.  But then this one comes to mind:  "He who hesitates is lost."  Fudge it all.  If I don't do something then I will live in an inner hell (which we don't want to happen again).  And don't worry--I do not believe I am being hasty.  Not at all.  Just courageous.  And not blind courage.  Very visible courage.  It's one of those things that if I don't do by the end of this week, it will be a lost cause.  But I'm afraid I will fuck things up again.  I tend to do that.  Come on, Megan!  Pressure's on!

       First Day   My class is very rowdy.  And I don't like the idea of "punishment" because it is bible camp.  Anyways, I saw JW today and he was looking well. I was supposed to bring Helena and Elisabeth home for Anne Marie because she was at the hospital with J-Dub, but they both showed up at the end.  That's a good sign.

       Nervous   Tomorrow is my first day teaching bible camp.  And I'm nervous.  Just a little.  Kids always love me though (I don't know why), so it should be fine.  I just hope Scary Stocker Boy (name?) isn't working this year.  He constantly stares at me and is way too friendly.  This is the one who caught me going to my car one Sunday after church just to say hi.  He thinks my birthday is in May and that I went to Disneyland (?).  No clue why.  I'm hoping if I wear my hat and sunglasses he won't recognize me.  *crossed fingers*  Anyhoo, I'll report back tomorrow re: the first day.  Countdowns: Dance recital:  One Week Vacation: Two Weeks Birthday:  Thirty-Four Days

       I am Happy!   This morning, I was not happy because I woke up really sick to my stomach.  But then I got better and was doing great.  I took my grandma out to lunch at Chilli's.  She has the best stories of when she was young.  Stories about her first husband, living next to a queer guy, and having a stroke when Terry (her son, my uncle) was one years old.  She just has a lot of wonderful life experiences to share.  Backing it up to before lunch, I discovered my favorite store in the whole wide world:  urlLink Cost Plus World Market .   You have to go there.  It is like a cheap Pottery Barn, but better because of the items they have from around the world.  I got a bunch of cool pictures for my room, one of which was a picture of an abbey in Ireland.  Soooo beautiful!  Just in case you'd like to visit:  Down Stevens Creek, past the mall aways.  It will be on your left.  It's by Circut City (not the one by Tony and Alba's).  If you've gone to the Toyota dealership, you've gone too far.  Happiness for the night:  Staying over with Bobby and Veronika at the house in Sunnyvale they are "sitting."  Happiness for Saturday morning:  Decorating my classroom for Vacation Bible Camp @ SMT.  Uneasiness for Sunday morning:  Having to go up in front of the alter at church for a special blessing for VBC.  Yuck.  PERPETUAL HAPPINESS:  For Veronika.  For buying her first car!!  A Honda Civic!  2004!  Silver!  Now we have sister cars :)....And Bobby with his Honda Accord can be our brother car!  Hooray for Hondas!

       The Talk   N= Natalie--9 year old I babysit in Willow Glen M= Me  Setup:  Driving in my car down Bascom  N: What does is mean for a girl to get a period? M: Ummm...Maybe you should ask your mom that question.  (I didn't know what to say!?) N: What's dicks? M: Umm...What do you mean? N: You know, dicks. M: You mean, like male anatomy? N: Eww!  No, you're so gross!  What's Dick's Center, that place we just passed?  Okay, so I've been thoroughly embarrassed by a nine year old.  But hey, what's new?

       I Can't Sleep   Anyways, I read the  urlLink very  first blog entry  that I wrote (No More Passion), and it startled me how broken I was just a few months ago.  I have improved so much with all that crap I had to deal with (aka the Big D).  Professionally, I've been told it's over.  And after reading that first entry, I believe it. I wouldn't classify myself as happy, but I'm dealing.  I'm doing that thing called life.  I have been having horrible anxiety attacks over work.  Every night before, I get so anxious and panicy about going to work in the morning.  I am afraid I'll do something wrong (there's the perfectionist inside of me).  Moreover, having a job is a sign that I'm growing up.  Which scares me within itself.  Admit it, we all sometimes long for the innocent days of childhood where summer consisted of all-day pajama days and cartoons.  But I think I long for it too much, and that worries me.  I mean, I can't wait to be an "adult", raise a family, and be a teacher.  I guess you never feel ready.  Ready for the big world with too many responsibilities and no one to stay home with you when you're sick (aka Mom).  But I can't stop the process, so I might as well embrace it.

"Here we are, at the prime of our lives, blossoming in our youth, ready and willing...  ... sitting at our computer desks, visually limited to the screen or pages of symbols and numbers, destroying our sleep-deprived bodies with caffeine and drugs."

       Swoosh!   Last night at about 10pm, Danielle, Brian, and I decided to go to Campbell Park to shoot some hoops.  When we got there, there were scary people doing drugs outside of their cars, and of course, Danielle decided to pull up right in front of them.  They kept staring at us so we decided to park elsewhere.  Amazingly enough, there were other groups at the basketball courts too, so we didn't feel too weird.  I discovered that I could not dribble a basketball for the life of me!  The concept seems so simple--just bounce the ball between your hand and the ground.  I guess I'm just dribble-challenged.  We  got tired of that and decided to swing.  After a while, these roughty kids--mostly boys, but about two girls--stormed the adjacent playground and horsed around on that twirly thing that spins.  Then all of the sudden they sprinted down the bike trail.  Just then, a cop car pulled up and the officer started to approach us.  Not connecting 1 and 1, we thought that we were violating curfew because it was 11:30 or something.  So we gathered up our things are started to head for the car.  The officer actually stopped us and asked us questions about the kids who ran.  What did they look like, how  many, what were they doing, etc. We showed him their cars and he and some other officer actually waited for them.  I wanted to see what would happen but we had to leave because he said the park closed at 10pm.  Darn.  So that was my adventure last night.  Pretty intense compared to the "nothings" that usually happen to me.  Anyhoo, I'm off to the gym to run with my new Nikes!

       Cool, Hot, Crowded, Refried Beans   The most defining descriptors of the day.  When we got to SCU, it was cool.  A lovely breeze.  Then it got really hot towards the end.  Everyone was really sweaty and gross.  When we were leaving, it was so crowded getting out of Buck Shaw Stadium.  Wall to wall people, cranky, hot, tired, and hungry.  That was fun.  But Vaci was so cute in her little gown and hat.  I love her so much that it was worth the good, bad, and in-between.  Congrats to Veronika, member of the class of 2004!  Hooray!  Then we met a bunch of people at La Paloma.  The beans were so divine.  Simply the best.  And I ate some chicken enchilada and had a churro for dessert.  Yummy.  It was  so interesting the range of nationality at our table.  There was Milla, an exchange student from Brazil, Julia, an exchange student from Germany, Stephanie, who spent a year in Costa Rica, and Elvis, who is native of Guyana.  And of course Vaci, Aniko, Andrew, and Aggie are from Hungary.  It was fun hearing their different stories from around the world and what their thoughts of America were.  Highly interesting.  Got home.  Decided to go buy the new  urlLink Nike Shox Bella running shoes  because I am in desperate need of a decent pair.  They are really fun shoes--aesthetically and mechanically.  They have motivated me to take a run later.  I also purchased two  urlLink Original Xertubes .  For lack of better adjectives, they are also fun.  "To-Do" for tomorrow:  Church Clean Room Dance rehersal at AMT  And I'm absolutely going to clean my room because everyday I keep saying, "Oh, I'll do it tomorrow."  Yet each day it has the same unkempt look:  Clothes EVERYWHERE (dirty and clean).  Dust bunnies.  Miscellaneous crap cluttering the joint.  Tomorrow, no more!  You are my accountability, okay?

       Gal Friday   That's me.  Anyhoo, part of my job requires delivering documents to other firms and whatnot.  If they are far away, I drive Ann's (the president's) car.  But today, the firm was only  a  couple of blocks away, so I walked.  On my way I saw the strangest bakery ever.  It was called Amnesia Bakery.  I didn't link to it because I can't find it anywhere on the web.  Maybe it's one of those Twilight Zone experiences.  Maybe I imagined it.  Anyhoo, the door to it was painted like an animation picture of a door.  And in the window instead of hosting real bakery goodies, it showcased bold, gaudy  plastic pastries.  The sign on the door did say "Open," and I contemplated whether I should take a side trip to this bakery--at least peek in my head.  To my naive knowledge, I was afraid it could have been like some bizarre club or something.  There's a lot of those downtown where I work.  But I ended up passing it up.  But next time, oh next time...I am determined to see what it is.  I'll let you know.  *yawn*  The Reuter Family Van is departing at 6:45 am to go to Veronika's graduation.  I better get some shut eye  ;)

       I Officially Declare That Responsibility Sucks   Isn't that the truth?  For starters, I am getting tired of my responsibility to all of you who have nothing better to do than read my blog.  I feel obligated to keep this site up now.  But not to worry, deep down I do enjoy talking about nothing and knowing people really care.  I guess I'll use this analogy to explain:  It's like the first summer my brother and I discovered the computer game The Sims.  We loved it so much that we played it every day.  Okay, we were a little bit addicted.  Then there was a period in time where we found ourselves worn out from the same-old same-old.  But soon later we loved it again and played it a lot.  Kind of like blogging, eh?  Here's what I'm excited about:  This weekend Vaci (aka Veronika aka Bobby's girlfriend) is graduating from Santa Clara University this Saturday morning.  The only thing I'm not excited about is that the ceremony starts at 8:30am...and we have to get there early for parking, seating, etc.  But the post-lunch party is at La Paloma, the BEST Mexican restaurant EVER!  Hooray!  They have the most delicious beans IN THE WORLD!    Anyways, I promise to update more frequently...maybe after the graduation...and the BEANS!

       First Day   My first day at work was yesterday.  It was really fun.  I even have my own office--how cool is that?  Anyways, I did a lot of copying and paper shredding.   Also, at 9am everyday, I do a "Starbucks Run," where I get everyone what they want from the Starbucks downstairs.  And then I later do a lunch run (same idea except I go to places like Subway or Le Bou).  And the people who work there are soooo nice.  It is a women runned office, so only one man works there--the husband of a woman who already works there.  I thought I would feel like a high schooler--like a bit inferior--but I didn't.  It was awesome.  I look forward to next time!  PS:  Everybody go see Raising Helen...it is a great movie :)

       So I don't know if I really liked the end of  urlLink The Nanny Diaries .   If you haven't read it, and plan on reading it, please read no further.   Okay, so Nan kinda gets fired (inevitably), and she goes back into the Xes' house seeking some closure (and possibly get more money).  Finally, after all readers (or at least after I) anticipate when Nan will tell Mrs. X off, she does it.  But into a recorder in one of Grayer's bears?   I dunno, kinda weak.  I wanted a full on face-to-face cat fight.  But even with that scenario, I don't know if I would have been satisfied either.  Anyways, also, what about Grayer?  Will he grow up to be a philanderer like his father?  Or, more crucial, will the fact that Nan left him totally destroy his childhood?  The last we see Grayer he is screaming for Nanny in the vacation "crap-house" (Mr. X).  I didn't feel closure with Grayer.  And then what about this new baby on the way?  Will the recorded message in Grayer's teddy bear affect Mrs. X, or more importantly, will she ever hear it?  And the book concludes with Nan naming her inherited dog Grace?  Great book, but bad ending.   By the way, I just got my senior portraits and they're horrible.   Like I've never taken such horrible pictures in my life.  Now keep in mind, they are the unairbrushed proofs.  I bravely picked the best one out of the bunch.  Brace yourselves...

       Guess what I'm doing right now?  Transferring items from my cheapo-supremo Old Navy purse into my new, posh  urlLink Louis Vuitton  purse!!!  It's sooo beautiful.

       This post may be tardy, but regardless, I present to you the books I read on vacation with blurbs of commentary:         urlLink Skin Game    A great read for those who can relate. It's a woman's memoir of struggling, enduring, and surviving a cutting disorder. Poignant, blunt, and well-written.          urlLink the curious incident of the dog in the night-time    A physcological thriller bound to be a classic someday.  Same diction and style as  The Catcher in the Rye . Christopher (main character) struggles with mental abnomalities while being challenged with external conflicts. His relentless curiosity leads him to investigate the death of a neighbor's dog, and he ends up learning more than he bargained for.      urlLink Island of Illusions    I came across this book on our travels to Harmony, Minnesota--a quaint Amish town. It was only 25 cents, so I figured, why not. Your typical romance novel. Karen (main character) meets Solo (her lover) through an assignment from the FBI. Both are agents. After breaking the reins from her controlling mother and conquering other internal struggles, she and Solo live happily ever after. Of course the 'happily ever after' comes after some steamy romance scenes on the beach. I wouldn't pay more than the 25 cents for it; nonetheless, a good indulgence.         urlLink The Secret Life of Bees    Indescribable. Classic, obvious innocence to awareness theme in American Literature. About Lily's (main character) journey growing up having to deal with the fact that she killed her mother when she was little, and she now has to live with an abusive father. Until she escapes with her nanny and finds a group of women beekeepers who forever change her. You have to buy this book and read it. It is superbly excellent.         urlLink Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim    Brillantly satirical. Each chapter is a different story about an ordinary time in David's (main character) life. The skill of this author is readily apparent, demonstrated in his way of making ordinary things humorous and interesting. Definitely a good buy.         urlLink Reading Lolita in Tehran    A definite waste of $13.95. I read about one quarter of this book, then put it down in distaste. The concept sounded like a good one: Thursday mornings, a liberal American teacher in Tehran teaches outlawed books to some of her most prized students. True story, by the way. But the book was going nowhere, and the concept itself was underdeveloped. I'd like to give another author a try at this plot--to turn a misguided read into a triumph.

        The Girl in the Other Room     The girl in the other room  She knows by now  There's something in all of her fears  Now she wears it threadbare  She sits on the floor  The glass pressed tight to the wall  She hears murmurs low  The paper is peeling  Her eyes staring straight at the ceiling    Maybe they're there  Maybe it's nothing at all  As she draws lipstick smears on the wall    The girl in the other room  She powders her face  And stares hard  Into her reflection    The girl in the other room  She stifles a yawn  Adjusting the strap of her gown  She tosses her tresses  Her lover undresses  Turning the last lamp light down  What's that voice we're hearing?  We should be sleeping  Could that be someone who's weeping?    Maybe she's there  Maybe there's nothing to see  It's just a trace of what used to be    The girl in the other room  She darkens her lash  And blushes  She seems to look familar

            La familia y yo en Duluth, MN      Last night, I participated in the  urlLink Special Olympic's  long distance running and walking training. It was invigorating to see those mentally challenged kids and adults so happy to be there. They are fantastic people who, despite their disabilities, seem to savor a life of joy that is unwavering.     Henry, who is 35 and mentally challenged, is the sweetest person. He was so happy to see me and kept asking me all these questions. The main coach told me to tell him my last name is Smith because he is the type who would look me up in the phonebook and call me. lol. At intermitent times during our run, he would burst out asking me, "Are you a teeeeeeeenager?" He was the cutest, friendliest person ever.    There were many others in the group who I connected with. They are just the sweetest bunch of people you'd ever want to meet. Special Olympics is their life. It's what gets them out of bed in the morning. I'm glad I can be a part of such a pivotal aspect in their lives.     Guess what tomorrow is?! I'm sooo excited. I've got a fun day planned. I'm doing stuff with family in the morning, then meeting up with friends for dinner. In the morning, my family and I are going to go to Starbucks to get a drink, chat, and whatnot. Then we're going to walk a  urlLink labyrinth  near the Willow Glen area.  Of course, we plan on dining at  urlLink In-n-Out Burger  for lunch. My mom told me she doesn't have any presents for me yet, so she and my dad are going shopping in the afternoon. Then at about 6:30, everyone's meeting at my house and going over to eat dinner at  urlLink Tsing Tao --the best Chinese restaurant ever!  Then back to my place for some fun!  Excellent!

       Went to see JW tonight with Mom, Bobby, & Veronika.  I was scared at first.  What does one say to someone who is dying?  It's hard.  I tried my best to just act normal.  Talking about everyday things.  It was nice to see him smile.  But when he is not smiling, he just looks so depressed.  I mean, who wouldn't be in his shoes?  But it just makes me sad.  It is difficult to see someone around your own age suffering and slowly dying like that.  It puts you face to face with mortality.  He has kept himself in good spirits despite the terrible reality he faces.  I admire him for that.      Then I think of his siblings.  Will Alexander even remember him?  Just the other day, JW forgot he had his sister Elisabeth.  His short term memory is worsening.  How difficult it must be for everyone.  I think of how close I am to my brother and can't imagine him in JW's position.  I just can't even  imagine it.    I am dazzled by his parents' tremendous strength and fortitude in these troubled times.  Take Geert, for example.  He says that his typical day is he goes to see JW before work, goes to work, and then comes back to the hospital so that Anne-Marie can go home and shower and spend some time with the other kids.  Anne-Marie practically lives at the hospital.  I just admire the parents so much.    Prayers continue.  For a miracle (there still is always hope).  For a painless death.  For the strength of family and friends.  For the compassion and hard work of nurses and doctors.  For faith and hope to deepen throughout this experience.  I believe in the healing power of prayer, so please keep on praying.

       What I learned in my two weeks in Minnesota &amp; Wisconsin:    1.  You  don't order soda.  It's called "pop."  When the waiter asks in his or her midwestern accent what kind of pop you want, don't say "pardon?" or "what did you say?" more than twice if you don't understand.  Just don't.    2.  Remember,  you  have an accent, not them.    3.  Racial jokes are welcome in that conservative, red-neck setting.  After all, you're surrouned by white people 24/7.  It's a great change from California:  fast-food workers actually speak English.    4.  Don't try to leave a note in Spanish for the hotel maids.  They are all African American.    5.  If you've ever had real Mexican food (aka you're from California), do not go to a Mexican restaurant in that area.  The food is laughable.  You're safer going to a Chili's or some other generic restaurant.    6.  Beware!  You're surrounded by people wearing "Vote Bush" buttons.    7.  Bring an umbrella.  At any moment, it could downpour.    8.   Always check the Culver's flavor of the day in your area.  You wouldn't want to miss out on some yummy, home-made frozen custard.    If you keep all of the above in mind, I guarantee you'll survive your trip to the midwest!  :)

       Senior pictures were...very interesting, to say the least. Surprisingly, Danielle was there when I got there. I got to watch her take her pictures and it was sooo funny. She bought the largest package, which had like 26 poses with several different outfits. My most favorite pose she did was when the camera lady had her sniffing the flowers with a serious look on her face. lol. I'm SO glad we didn't order that package. I just am getting the cap and gown and the drape. Even with less variety in my package, it was still weird. I felt like a Barbie contorting my neck and head in different positions. I'm just worried about my serious expression...that should be a fun one to get in the mail!    Anyhoo, more seriously, my mom and I went to Mary's Garden at SMT this evening to pray for JW. We were a little shocked and disappointed that we were the only ones there, when so many people know about the meetings. If you don't, here's the 411: Every evening 6-8pm @ Mary's Garden @ SMT. You can drift in anytime; it's pretty informal. My mom and I were there from 6-6:30pm.    Tomorrow, Bobby and I are going to the beach!  Hooray!  I'm looking forward to some fun in the sun :)

       In response to  urlLink this post &amp; comment :    As far as thinking and analyzing too much, I disagree.  And Anonymous is probably laughing right now because the fact that I am dedicating a post for a rebuttal infers that I do think and analyze too much.  I just hate when people make statements like that who don't even know me.  I wrote about one instance and Anonymous thinks he can just make a general statement about me like that.  Maybe he reads my blog consistently, but my postings are only small glimpses into my  real  life.    Is it so wrong to express what I am feeling?  That is normal.  Not over-analytical.  This is a blog.  My venting device.

       So I'm back to facing  reality.   Reality that scares me like on Monday I am having my senior portraits taken.  WTF?!  Am I really a senior?  The top of the haystack at high school, soon to fall to the bottom of the barrel at some college.  lol...sorry for those lame personifying analogies.  But it's sooo scary.    Then guess what Saturday is?!  My  17th    birthday.  That means I am like one year away from adulthood by number.  On Saturday it will be truly legal for me to read   Seventeen .  It's always seemed so out of reach.  Now it's here.  What am I supposed to do?  When I think about it, 17 isn't that different than 16.  But if you go through your whole life saying that, then someday you'll be 50 saying it isn't that different from 30.    Should I be making different goals for my life now?  What am I supposed to be doing?   Everything around me is changing and I'm just standing here going, "okay..."  I just feel like I'm in a whirlwind right now.     BTW,  isn't   this   new   color   option   cool ?  Thank you Blogger!

      Hey everyone!  I am in Duluth, Minnesota staying at the Inn on the Lake (that would be Lake Superior).  They have free internet access in the lobby, so I decided to update!  Lucky you!  Vacation has been completely wonderful!  I don't want to tell you too much because I plan to write a more detailed entry when I return this Saturday.  I have been writing muchos postcards to like anyone and everyone.  As long as I have your address, you can expect to receive one any day now.  I just shipped out the new batch from Duluth.  Duluth.  I can picture myself living here one day.  It is a quaint town nestled right on Lake Superior's shore.  There are many delicate shops and bustling restaurants to entertain oneself.  Plus, it has a sinous, beautiful trail outlining the lake's edge.  You can rent bikes (which we plan to do tomorrow) or simply walk it.  Our hotel here is wonderful.  Our hotel room is on the first floor.  It's mightiest quality is the large window and patio area only feet away from the lake.  It is sooooo relaxing!  I just read my book out there all afternoon and wrote postcards while sipping a water bottle.  In the actual room (well two rooms, if you want to get literal), there are 3 king size beds and a pull out couch.  The bathroom is fit for a queen, complete with those ever desirable mini shampoos, lotion, soaps, and conditioners.  Don't you love those?  Even in the cheapest motels they have them and I have a fetish for collecting them.  Hell, who wouldn't want something that was free?!  Plus, they're  Spa  brand.  How more luxurious can it get?  Anyways, this is our second to last stop before home.  We are here 3 nights, then drive back to Minneapolis/St. Paul (where we'll be visting the Mall of America!  Yahoo!)  Even though it is so irresitible here, I am pining to return home, blogging in front of my own computer, sleeping in my own bed, and driving my car.  I know this statement is overdone, but it's true, so I must say it--oh crap, it just slipped my mind.  You know the one about how it's always nice to come back home?  Riiiight.

      I've been trying to think of a good farewell post before I leave on vacation, but I can't.  Maybe if I find a computer with internet access while I'm in Minnesota or Wisconsin, I will update :)  If not, I'll post when I get home, after 7/17!  Take care!

       My nerdy brother, Bobby, just received his  fifth  refurbished Mac  purchased off of  urlLink eBay .  That's where most of his paychecks from SMT go.  We have so many comps in our house it's disgusting.  But as long as I have my G4, I'm happy.

        " We are young, heartache to heartache we stand    No promises, no demands    Love is a battlefield    We are strong, no one can tell us we're wrong    Searchin' our hearts for so long    All of us knowing, love is a battlefield"

          I met Annie at Jamba Juice this afternoon.  She's the one who I've danced with for several years and will be leaving for Notre Dame in Indianna this year.  We just had so much fun looking through recital pictures, gossiping about the boys in our lives (or lack there of), and chatting about what the future holds for us at college and beyond.  We've shared so many memories from our years dancing together that are priceless.  It's hard to get used to the fact that this year's memories will be made without her.  It won't be the same.  I will truly miss her.  I send her my best wishes and prayers for her college career :)  OH--btw--I found out something HILARIOUS from her!  She was a dance teacher aide at Bellarmine for two weeks this summer, and guess who was taking dance from her!  Mark Rosetti!  I found that to be the funniest thing I've heard all day.  Mark, doing jazz and tap dance?  She said he was one of the more challenged students she had the pleasure of teaching.  That gave me a good laugh!  Rumor is he's not  that  bad in tap, but jazz in another story.  I still remember him  trying  to dance at the Bell mixer.  My friends and I laughed for hours after seeing him try!  It's a spectacle that everyone should witness sometime in their lives!

         My favorite quotes from  urlLink Tuesdays With Morrie :    "When he smiles it's as if you'd just told him the first joke on earth."              "...your soul, perfectly awake, is imprisoned inside a limp husk."     "Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do; Accept the past as past  without denying or discarding it ; Learn to  forgive yourself  and to forgive others;  Don't assume that it's too late to get involved ."     "My days were full, yet I remained, much of the time, unsatisfied."     "Dying is only one thing to be sad over...Living unhappily is something else."     "The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it."     "So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning."     "If you really want it, then you'll make your dream happen."     "The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in."     "Everyone knows they're going to die, but nobody believes it.  If we did, we would do things differently."     "We are too involved in materialistic things, and they don't satisfy us. The loving relationships we have, the universe around us, we take these things for granted."     "Don't cling to things, because everything is impermanent."     "You have to find what's good and true and beautiful in your life as it is now."     "And while his body was stiff as a sandbag, you could almost see him dancing inside it."     "Don't let go too soon, but don't hang on too long."     "But as his body rotted, his character shone even more brightly."     "The closer he got to the end, the more he saw [his body] as a mere shell, a container of the soul."
