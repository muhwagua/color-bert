      Alright I can already tell that this whole continuous entry thing is not going to work, I just don't have enough time or motivation. But anyways today was such cool day. The walkout was awesome! Anyone who didn't go really missed out. I was hestitant at first but it turned out I really got into it. I really surprised myself. And my little group even got to meet the Lieutenant governer Beverly Perdue, we got to give her a flyer! We also got to go into Marc Basnight's office, (the president pro-tempore of the senate) his secretary was there but he wasn't. O well it was still really cool. We just had a test on them too so it was really cool actually getting to see them. It's weird because they seem more like names then just real people. Who woulda knew?! Well it turned out that Raleigh Charter was actually the majority there by far. I think Broughton and Enloe people got suspended if they went, so I know that played a big part in the turnout. I'm actually really appreciative of RCHS right now. This was my first real protest and I think it was a really good experience, and I'd love to do something like that again. I never really used to think twice about protests, but I know I will now. It's weird how one event can really change your outlook on things. Well I'm definitely more anti-war now then ever. It was so cool seeing everyone with similar ideas going out and really working towards what they believe in. I used to think protestors that go out and get arrested are just stupid, but I really have a whole new opinion of them now. It takes guts.

      It seems as if everyone has a blog nowadays, so I figure what better way to spend my time then to write down my thoughts and have everyone read them. (not that anyone is going to read this, but I guess you never know ) Well anyways, all those blogs out there have really inspired me to start one of my own. Some of them are actually quite good and kind of make me hope that no one will read mine, but I guess you don't know how good of a writer you are until you start writing. Alright well I'm still not exactly sure how this works so I'm gonna enter this much and see what happens.  Well I think I figured everything out. This whole thing is actually pretty cool. An online jounral I guess.You know I've always wanted to keep a journal, and I used to try really hard but I could never keep it up for more then a couple weeks. I never really had anything interesting to talk about when I was little anyways, so none of my entries were very interesting. Plus I used to have to force myself to sit down and write because I hated writing, and I think you really want to have to want to write to write something worth reading. Dr.Busonik always tells us to write what we feel or something like that, and lately I've been enjoying writing. His class is really starting to shape up. Typing is also a hell of a lot easier than writing stuff down on paper, so maybe I'll be able to keep these entries continuous. And reading back over this entry I can see I still don't have anyting interesting to talk about at the moment. Maybe tomorrow.

      You know anyone reading this blog probably thinks I'm psycho. But there is sooo much going on in my life right now that I think I might just be going psycho. My sister is getting MARRIED next weekend, not to mention she's pregnant, plus this crap with school, and then my family that have been acting nuts. You know my life really is like a sitcom. I wonder if there's hidden cameras all over my house like in the Truman Show. You know that movie really freaked me out because it COULD be true and the whole movie could just be a ploy to make you think something like that could never happen. That movie really did get me thinking up all these "what-if" situations. If you haven't seen it you should definitely rent it. You know what else is a good movie, The Lion King. That movie rocks. I'm listening to Hakuna Matata right now. It's a great song. It is a sad movie though. I could never watch the part where Mufassa dies, I always had to fast forward through it. I always cry in Disney movies. The Fox and the Hound has got to be the all time worst tear jerkers. Man why the hell do they make Disney movies so sad? Their suposed to be for kids. I'm surprised our whole generation isn't depressed. They should start blaming depression cases on Disney. People could sue.  Well my mom just got home with the chinese food so it's time for me to go.

      You know life sucks, life really really sucks. I know lots of people just say that to get attention or pity but man do I mean it. If there is a God he hates me. He's up in heaven laughing at me right now. This isn't fair. Shit always happens to me. Maybe it's because I'm jewish. Shit always happens to jews. I don't think I can handle any more depression. As if school isn't bad enough by itself there's my family that I swear has gone 100% psycho and now officially all hate each other, and I'm stuck right smack in the middle of all that. PLUS as of today I think a certain someone really hates me or is just really annoyed with me which is just as bad, and this whole situation is driving me nuts not too mention depressing me to a probably dangerous state. The thing is I'm really good at hiding all these emotions so I don't think anyone knows and I'm basically by myself on this one. I do think my parents think somethings up with me. I think they think I'm on drugs which I must say I am most definitely not. I've basically stopped talking at home which I'm sure seems really weird but I just can't stand my family any more. It seems I always get in trouble when I start talking so I just don't.  I used to depend on school to cheer me up (imagine that) but lately and especially after today I have NO MOTIVATION whatsoever for going. Why do I have to be so damn obsessive over things. I have a MONOMANIA and I hate it. It's probably obvious what I'm talking about now, and if this was a real diary I would be much more specific but I do remember this is public. And here I am yapping to a blog where I probably should be talking to someone.  O well this is safer. There is one thing I keep telling myself, it seems things have hit an all-time low so there's nowhere to go but up.  Something good has to happen to you Sharon. PLEASE. I think I deserve something good. My day has to come eventually and I am READY. Who knows maybe tomorrow will be awesome. I highly doubt it but maybe.

      I have come to realize the only time I feel like updating this blog is when I'm really pissed off. I think that's when I think the best though, which in a way is good because lately everyone's been pissin me off. Everyone says their own family is screwed up but I seriously don't think they can compare to mine. Well I'm not going to get into that at the moment.   So much stuff is happening right now. Our band concert was last night, and it was my last one. It's actually really depressing. Now I'm starting to worry about whether switching to drama was the right thing. Next year is stressing me out and it hasn't even started yet. I don't think that's a good sign. Man school's so difficult. To make things even worse everyone in school is changing. EVERYONE. I know everyone says things change, but it's just so weird. People are hanging out with different people and everyone's personalitys have totally changed. Does anyone else realize this or is it just me? I think I've changed a bunch this year as well. I think I've gotten a lot more independent. I'm starting to really appreciate solitude. Everyone's telling me I've changed too. A lot of people told me I look a lot different than I did last year. I think I look the same but I don't know.   I'm going to be an aunt soon. How weird is that? Aunt Sharon. I think it sounds good. I still can't believe my sister is having a baby girl, OR the fact that she is no longer Robin Levine but now Robin Cooper. It's so weird. Everythings happening all at once. Robin AND Forrest have actually moved into our house. That's right MY HOUSE. I always thought married couples were supposed to go get starter homes, but NO my parents had to let them live with us. (more evidence of them going psycho) Well I guess that just goes back to the fact that my family can't ever do anything normal. I did get a TV though, which is a key element of my plan to live in my room.   I'm going to see Phantom of the Opera tomorrow. I'm so excited. I heard it's really good. We have good seats too. Well actually I'm not exactly sure where they are but they BETTER be good for what we paid for them.   Proms coming up and everyone's going. It's not fair. I want to go. All these sophomores are going and sophomores aren't supposed to go. I don't like it, we're suposed to have to wait until we're juniors. All tradition is lost. O well I'm going to wait. (but that's just because I don't really have many upperclassman guy friends)   Well It's almost 10 and I REALLY have to get to work on my poetry project. I have a strong feeling I'm going to be up till 3am Sunday night anyways..........

      Alright time to update the ol' blog after well over a month. A lot's been going on but I just have had no motivation for writing it out. BUT I DO NOW. Well here it goes.....  First things first. The new harry potter book came out like a day ago. I must say I was quite excited about this. It's only been like 2 years since I sat up till 3am buried in the Goblet of Fire and I'm looking forward to the lack of sleep again. I'll also admit that I was one of the dorks that went to the Harry Potter parties (yes HARRY POTTER PARTIES) at the local bookstores. In fact I WENT TO 2!. (Borders and Barnes and Nobles) Now I can honestly say I was expecting to see one possibly two people I recognized but to my surprised I saw about eight people that I knew well. Not aquaintances but actual friends. I thought this was HILARIOUS as I figured I must be a dork for even considering going to one of these. It's amazing how many people hide their love for Harry. The "parties" were actually quite fun and the book is great so far, so far meaning only page 100 or so. I keep having to switch  off between this stupid summer reading, which brings me to another topic. Raleigh Charter is ruining me without even being in session yet. Everyones leaving, summer assignments are driving me crazy, and it is giving me absolutely nothing to look forward to junior year. I believe Junior year is supposed to be one of the best but I'm not sure how that's gonna happen. Southeast is looking better and better as well but I have a feeling I'm STUCK HERE as it is probably way too late to register. Siiiiiiiigh.   I got some of those bubbles that don't pop today. You know those things are really fun. It really brings out the "girly-girl" in people which I find HILARIOUS. They run away from those bubbles like their acid. There was like a million of them in my hair, and I'm pretty sure it was driving Rachael crazy as I didn't bother to attempt to remove them. I didn't care though I think their fun. I mean unpoppable bubbles, what's not to love?! Definitely a good investment.   O YEAH. I got my blue belt a couple days ago. The testing went great. I didn't mess up bad like last time, but I did cut my foot on my breaking. It was nasty I looked down and there was huge puddle of blood beneath my foot. It scared me at first but then I found myself laughing at the thought of someone else standing in it. I am aware that sounds pretty gross but you gotta admit it's kinda funny. Anyways I now have the prettiest belt I've had yet.   Well that's not even close to all that's been going on but it is 1:40 in the morning and I have to leave SOMETHING for  tomorrow or (today). Not to mention I have to get busy on my English reading. GOOD NIGHT.

       Who needs a dream?  Who needs ambition?  Who'd be the fool  In my position?  Once I had dreams  Now they're obsessions  Hopes became needs  Lovers possessions.  Then they move in  Oh so discreetly  Slowly at first  Smiling too sweetly  I opened doors  They walked right through them  Called me their friend  I hardly knew them.

      Our neighbors just came over to eat dinner with us. I admire one of my neighbors so much. He is the most brilliant man I know. He seems to just spit out facts and know EVERYTHING. A lot of people like this just annoy me, but he doesn't flaunt it and is just a really admirable person. I hope when I grow up I can be somewhat like that. This man has always liked me as a person, and has always told my parents he wanted his daughter, which has always been like a little sister to me, to be like me. Coming from him I find this to be a huge compliment but tonight while leaving, he kept telling me to "be good" and was acting like I was some rebellious teen. I found this strange seeing as how I AM the "good child". I thought about it and I realized it was probably because I started fighting with my sister in the middle of dinner, and since she's "pregnant" everythings automatically my fault. I've realized the only time I ever appear to be "bad" is when I'm with my sister. I turn into such a smartass with her, and I cuss a lot more than I normally do, and I admit it I can be a real bitch with her, but she deserves it all. I never start anything, it's all her. As if I didn't like her enough before, I have realized tonight that she even ruins my image.   Anyways back to my neighbor. He is one of the only people I know that actually amazes me with brilliance and makes me want to learn. I mean there are tons of smart people but he just seems to have this understanding of everything and makes it so intriguing. He's fascinated with the littlest thing and turns them into somthing truly amazing. I find myself just fixated on what he's saying, and just wishing I knew as much as he did. He knows all these nitty gritty details as well which is so cool. His musical knowledge really impresses me. He can tell you the artist of anything,  from any time period, and everything about them. I swear a song comes on and he knows the artists death date, how he died, where, when, where they went to school, everything. It's really cool.   The point here is this whole thing really just made me realize how important it is to have a good understanding of the world at large. It also made me realize how ignorant some people are. It actually made me WANT to pay attention in class. It's amazing how the best teachers really aren't teachers at all.

      Yesterday was my dads birthday. He has reached the big 50. I can't believe it, my dads 50. It sounds so old but my parents don't seem old at all. They don't look it either. I hope I don't look old when I'm 50. Speaking of me being 50, I was talking to Miranda about how I can't at all visualize myself at that age. Heck I can't even see myself past 18. But then I thought about when I was 7 and couldn't picture me past 10. Well the point is it scared me. What am I gonna be like? Am I going to have a husband? Kids? A good profession? I've really been thinking a lot about the future and it worries me. Sigh.

      Man school is really eating up my life. I know I can't complain all that much because it's the same for everyone, but man I just can't help it. I mean we have school 5 and half hours a day. I come home, I do schoolWORK for about 3 hours, sometimes more. That's almost 9 hours a day spent on school...... WHEN ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TIME TO BE KIDS????...... I mean my childhood is slipping away before my eyes and I don't have the time to cherish it. THIS IS INSANE FOLKS. At this rate I'm gonna have a heart attack before I reach 17.

      Lately, people have fascinated me, purely fascinated me. I went to the first friday a couple days ago, and unlike most people who were aimlessley wandering around, hanging off of their friends, making their way to the food stands and caught up in their own conversations, I realized I was off leaning on the "wall" with no one but Miranda and we were both just standing there watching. There was just so much going on, conversation seemed unecessary. I found my eyes wandering from group to group and somehow I was just mesmorized. I think I've gotten to the point where I place myself in a busy location just to observe. I just find human interaction so interesting. I mean why do people act the way they do? The concept that everyone is so different, however simple that may sound, just amazes me....... Wow I never thought I would turn into one of those quiet, always lost in thought kind of people, but I think it's happening.

      I went shopping for school supplies yesterday. Now I don't know about other people but for me this was always this huge event. I mean I would bug my mom forever just to take me to office depot, and I would have a blast there  buying all these things I didn't even need but HAD to get because I was so "caught up" in the mood. To this day I have no idea why this was so fun for me. Actually I think maybe it was the time organizing things when I got home that was so great. Everything was so neat and organized and every single year I would make a vow to myself that I was going to keep it like that for the year and it NEVER worked. But for that one week of school I just loved the "neatness", I mean I would just open my bookpack and look, and I would want to show everybody. Man back to school shopping was almost worth summer ending.  But hitting high school things changed. I never want go school shopping because that means school was starting, and I just wanted to put it off forever. I think I'm kind of always in denial up until that one trip to the store. This year it didn't really hit me for a long while. I think it was the book fair when I finally realized " A whole new year is starting". And although bummed, I starting thinking about the oppurtunitys that awaited ahead of me. I mean there are gonna be new friends, new guys, new teachers, new everything, and I you know I keep telling myself I hate school and don't want to go back, and sure there are parts of me that don't, but I have to admit I love for all these new things to enter into my life. The start of a school year is pretty exciting. So much happens in one year. I think of friends that have become really close to me, I think of guys that have drove me crazy, I think of all I've learned about myself and I think that all these things happen in such a short period of time. I think back at how different I am from freshman year, and I really wonder what is in store for me this year.    I noticed another thing as well. When I was in middle school I always had to get the "cool" pencils and pens and other supplies, and it never even occured to me that all these things were so trivial and stupid, not to mention the fact that they racked up tons of money. But as I was walking down the aisle I realized I really didn't care what I pencils I used, and I picked up the cheapest ones as they seemed the most practical.  This is something that has changed about me as well, and I love that it has. I can really say with confidence that I don't care what people think of me half as much as I used to. I think it happened somewhere in the middle of freshman year. Well I don't really know but I'm just glad it happened. I think if I met up with my "old self" I really don't think I would like me much. Some people just care sooo much about what people think of them that they change themselves so much to make them more likeable. I know this sounds like something you hear about everywhere from adults and teachers or what not, and we all say we don't do it but sooo many people still do, and frankly it drives me crazy. I love being myself.

      I just looked up a word and the definition had a word that didn't make sense so I looked that up. That definition of that word had a word I didn't know so I looked that one up as well. Same story with that word. And the next one. And the next one. I continued this for aproximitely seven rounds before I remotely understood a definition. (These were hard words I'm not quite that ignorant) Needless to say I forgot the original word. Now that's not how dictionaries are supposed to work. C'mon Webster help me out here......

If I were to never see her again, I think I would actually be a lot happier. And I hate hating my sister but I can't help it. She has made my life a living hell, she's torn up my family, and everyone thinks she's changed but she's still the same person she always was. This isn't fair and I can't stand it anymore.

      I just got back from sparring class and I must say that at the moment tae kwon doe is my savior. I AM LOOOOOVING IT. Any sport where your encouraged to kick and hit people is awesome by me. All my stress from school just totally escapes me when I'm there. It's so great. Not to mention the fact that you know in the back of your mind you can beat the crap out of just about anyone. This is the only thing that's keeping me sane.

      Our teachers don't realize we have other classes. Because of this I had my first breakdown last night. Yes I knew it was coming all along but boooom it happened. Aproximently 9:30 while doing my APUSH hw I realized that I was not physically or mentally capable of doing anymore work whatsoever. Now I'm aware that this would not be considered a breakdown, but with the companionship of the screams  that seemed to roll off my tounge (sorry dad, wrong place wrong time) and the sudden urge to burst into tears I figured I could well consider this my first official breakdown of the year. I have a strange feeling there are many more to come......I can't do this folks. I want last year back.

      Well Isabel's come and gone, and what do ya know I was right about it not being a big deal. The only big deal was the chaos going on in my house. We had 6 people (one very pregnant), 5 dogs, 3 cats, and a bird in there. The sister and dad were going crazy the whole time, and they must have bought half a years worth of non-parishables. Which no one will end up eating. I'm telling ya guys you haven't seen madness until you've spent a hurricane with the Levine's. It's a bit upsetting to see that all that we ended up with was a yard full of sticks. Maybe when I'm older people will listen to me- but I guess that's what I get for being the youngest.... But what I can't believe is how we managed to steal two school days from it. Which is AWESOME..... Another good thing that came out of this storm is the fact that I'm really starting to believe meteorology is my calling. I must of sat on my porch watching that thing for at least an hour, and I was purely amazed the whole time. Storms have always captivated me, I mean I've wanted to be a storm chaser since I was like 5. I stick to my belief that that would be the coolest job in the world. Too bad they make no money. And we all know that's was really makes the world go round.....

      Have you ever been soooo mad at your parents that you actually wanted to go out and do something really bad just to get revenge on them? I hate my dad right now. He doesn't realize how good he has it, and I feel like I need to do something to show him. I HATE THIS. I hate being in school, I hate being underage, I hate have my freaking parents think they can control everything I do, they don't understand me AT ALL........... I CAN'T WAIT TO GET AWAY FROM THIS HELLHOUSE. I'm actually hoping this freaking hurricane will come and destroy everything, I don't care anymore. I swear I've spent about a third  (if not than more) of my pathetic 16 year old life grounded in my room. I'm talking grounded for things other kids would never get grounded for. All because of my ass dad. And he asks me why I don't like him. GEE I WONDER.  He's so fake. Why don't you try acting around your "friends" like you act around us dad. Yeah no one would like you then dad.

      Wow this weekend was so great. It was one of those weekends that just flowed. One of those weekends that you compare other weekends too. One of those weekends that really made life a little bit easier. Well here goes..  I guess you can say it officially started Friday morning. It was a flex day, so in my opinion that kind of ties into the weekend. I really love flex days. It's so great to be in school, but not be in "school". Sometimes you just need a change, something out of the norm, and flex days (no matter how stupid some people think they are) usually provide that for me. This one in particular was pretty good. The whole "How to math" thing was actually fun.....although to my dissapointment I didn't learn how math was a verb. But anyways the thought of teaching kids and maybe having an impact on their lives kind of cheers me up. Just something to look forward too...... Well in the afternoon I had the building as text walk. Now seeing as how I had this in the afternoon I got the chance to talk to a lot of people that had it before me. Everyone I talked to said the same thing....."It was so boring and stupid", "it was pointless and tiring", well anyways of course I went into it thinking it was going to be just that, pointless and tiring. But much to my surprise I found it pretty interesting. I mean we are pretty lucky to live in such a historical area, and the fact that we got to go out and experience and take a look at the actual history (which I soon learned I knew little about) was pretty cool in my mind. Nice job teach.....  Later that afternoon I went to the Southeast Raleigh Homecoming game. I went into this thoroughly excited. I had never been to a real high school football game, and imagined it being just like the movies. Well much to my dismay I came out there quite different as I went in. That night I experienced: overwhelming crowds, (yes worse than the freshman mobs) a numerous amount of fights..... i mean full out beat the crap outa people fights, and I also realized that nobody seemed to include everyone. I mean everyone was hanging out with their close friends and that's it. There were distinguished "groups", and it kind of reminded me of middle school.   Well out of all that I realized that Raleigh Charter High School really isn't that bad. It's a good environment, and I needed an eye-opener like that game to help me realize it. I can really appreciate knowing everyone now, and I can clearly see that we really are accepting to everyone, and i like that.   All that and I'm only on Friday. Well on to Saturday..........  On Saturday me and Angela went over to the RLT ampitheatre. You may ask why we do this, and I myself can't really explain this, but in a couple of words.....it's fun to play on. Well anyways we went over to the stage and we came to realize that there was a wedding going on in the rosegarden. Well of course we couldn't be too loud during the wedding so we resorted to just kinda sitting and hiding from the wedding people-who kept looking at us weird. Since we couldn't make noise we decided to go see if Tom was home. Well he wasn't so we went to Hillsburough street and walked around....... You know I just love college campuses, there are so many interesting people......... Well anyways we went to I love NY pizza (the BEST pizza place in Raleigh) and came to discover that their pizza is only $1.60 and like 3 times bigger than the ones we get served at school!!!!! This both kind of angered us, it's not fair. But that's besides the point because we THEN went BACK to RLT and played some more, the wedding people still being there. They were just taking pictures though so we managed to stay out of their way. And I learned how to SKATEBOARD!!!......... Next we decided to call Noah and do something with him, so we all 3 went to Baskin Robbins. Geoff, Alyson and Jen were also there so we all ate together. It was great fun. Great great fun. Then they had to go. And I must say, I miss Noah...... Ok well then we left and went BACK to RLT (yes a 3rd time), and this time we got the stage to ourself. It was great fun. Our theatrical debut went quite well I must say. You know you feel really free on such a stage. Well it woulda been even more fun if these 3 freaky girls didn't come by and just watch us, so we went in the rosegarden and just sat down in the grass (very springy grass) and did nothing. You know, I've forgotten how nice it is to just do nothing except enjoy the outdoors. It really cleared my mind, and I think it was really beneficial to me. Definitely something I need to do again......just sit back and smell the roses. ( I think that's how that saying goes)  Yes Saturday was definitely a good day.  Sunday was good too. It consisted of shopping, and spending time with the gram and the mom. Good stuff. I would elaborate, but the fingers are getting tired.  All in all, it was a damn good weekend.

      Alright well since I just changed my template I lost my chatter and my counter. Didn't realize that would happen. Man I was getting pretty high on that counter too, I think it was on like 500 something. So when I get a new one add 500 to whatever the number is.

      Well this break went great. As of 6:12am Wednesday morning I am the proud aunt of Bailey Nicole Cooper. 7lbs 11oz. She's beautiful. She's a great baby too. Hardly cries at all.   I also went to the fair, which turned out that it was the same as every other year. I thought it might be different with the whole 150th anniversery or something. But no. I mean don't get me wrong I had fun. But it was kind of dissapointing that all the "new" rides were the same old rides with different names. Like they expect us not to notice. HA.  Man I spent a lot of money. And I lost my Hulk, still not quite sure how I did that.   I also got my brown belt. My testing went pretty well, and I'm really excited about this belt. It's pretty high and my form is really fun so far.   Well break ended today and man did I feel it. Schoolwise it wasn't such a bad day but man the high school social life isn't easy. I'm really starting to hate this school more and more. The worst part is a good chunk of it is the people. I'm just so sick of them all. I mean there are exceptions and I love all my friends but I just don't feel like there are that many people that I'm actually gonna miss after high school. I feel like I know everyone and I've made all the friends I'm gonna make and I'm just stuck. I want a change. I need a change. A guy would be nice. Someone that doesn't go get a girlfriend on me. I feel like my heart was ripped out and put in a blender......Well not quite but I like the way that sounds. And it's not that far off. I think that's from two of a kind. Girls in general are dumb. All the sterotypes are right. Boys just cause grief. O well now I'm just rambling. Sigh.....I've been doing that a lot lately.

      Well today was my first sick day of the year. Man do I miss being young and being able to actually enjoy these days. Nowadays you can't relax and just "be sick" because your (or I don't know about everyone but this is how it is for me) too uptight worrying about how much work your missing. I was actually arguing with my mom today about how I need to go to school tomorrow and can't miss another day. (fyi I didn't win, no sharon at school tomorrow) I never thought it would come to this. I lived for sick days when I was little.

We were like 10 minutes late and ended up getting some of the best seats in the house. (although difficult to reach in the dark) I could've reached out and tripped the people. But I didn't. That would be mean. Yet funny..... Great night.   Angela, what would I do without you?

      Well that's it, last day of break, time to put good ol' charter back into my life. I blocked it out for 5 whole days. And the best part is, midterms are in 2 WEEKS! My how the time flies. I better get crackin on the studying, I HAVE to do well on them. I've become such a stereotypical junior. College is really starting to pound on my back. College used to seem so far away, but man just a year a half away. I'm not sure whether to be excited or terrified. Well for now, just one more chapter of The Great Gatsby to go...

      Did anyone realize how pretty it was outside today? The weather was absolutely perfect. I didn't really notice until I went home and was locked out of the house. At first I was upset but then I realized how pretty it was and actually liked that I was stuck outside for a little while. It's amazing how a nice day can really perk up your day. I should have gone for a walk. Man why didn't I.

      I don't know why I try so hard. It's so clearly spelled out for me to stop, yet I keep going. I keep hoping even when I know hope is lost. I don't understand it. Why am I like this? Why can't I let things go? It's like my mind hates the thought of no so much that it almost blocks the whole concept out and replaces it with the constant need for yes. It's eating me up. I know I need to move on but I can't. I want to but I can't.   But is hope every really lost? Isn't there always some sort of distant possibility that maybe that yes will come my way? I think it's this that keeps me going. It's the chance, no matter how slim it may be, that maybe things aren't over. The future is so unexpected. It's this that drives me crazy, and it's this that keeps me sane.

I saw like 2 people walk in in weird clothes and if that wasn't enough I walk in the front door and 80's music is playing on speakers THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WE HAD!?! Yeah it took me a good couple of minutes to realize it was 80's day, definititely didn't see that one coming. Anyways that started my day off pretty interesting. We should have music play everyday, it was really uplifting.

      Wow I have an incredible amound of reading to be doing at this moment. I'm about 100 pages behind in Huck Finn, and Mrs. Schmitz made me feel so bad about not doing the reading that I'm actually really trying to complete it by tomorrow. Don't you hate it when teachers make you feel bad about not doing your work. O YEAH and I can't forget this play that Mrs. Rasnick assigned us to read by Monday. AHHHH my only easy class backfired.   On a higher note, I went to see The Fantasticks at Enloe on Thursday. I had actually been wanting to see that show for quite a while, so I was pretty excited but it turned out to be pretty corny. Don't get me wrong they did a great job, but it was a musical and I think there were a total of 2 songs I really liked. But it did make me laugh and it was an enjoyable night. AND we made it there on time. (easier said than done)  Katie's party was fun. The food was awesome, seriously they had like my dream snack table. NICE.   Halloween was fun too. The first Halloween I got to drive with my friends BY OURSELVES.   Well back to the books...

      Alright well it has been a looong time since I've updated this and I figure since Tori got me such a cool template I should update it.   Well, the past week was pure mess. Lets just say I had a realllllly bad weekend before exams and so it made them that much more difficult. My mind was elsewhere throughout all my studying and tests, but I realized you get through things and life goes on.   The afternoon after exams all the SSSs went out and we did the last gift exchange thing, and that was awesome and it SNOWED. (flurries or not it was cool) And we were going to go back to school to play in the parking lot-wow that sounds dumb but it's fun- but yeah as Elaina said stuff happened and we got a little held up. But I realized we have some really awesome teachers at our school.   Then I went back home with Lainer and we got stuck at the pharmacy desk at Harris Teeter for AN HOUR with some lady that we could barely understand. But we made the best of it and it was fun. Then came Elaina's house and we played bunCo and it was good EXCEPT Slotta beat everyone and that is NEVER exceptable. (Till next time Dutchie) But yeah that day was...full of events.  Last night I saw the show at RLT and it was awesome. Actually it was a really strange show but I enjoyed it. I also got to see some people I haven't seen for a while as well and that's always nice.   But yeah that's basically been the last week for me.

      You know lately I've realized that if you have something to say, say it. If you have something you want to do, do it. Don't wait for things to come to you, go after them yourself. Stop wondering what will happen, man just do it. If you don't, regret and wonder can drive a person mad.   I know I've always been told this, but I can really see it now.

      Man I have weird friends. If any of you don't know, I've had the same 2 best friends since first grade, and I'm pretty proud of that as I don't think most people can say that. How I'm still friends with them and none of the other Henry Adams people, I can't say....we just are. We've had this talk numerous times. It's so weird, especially now, we are all so completely different. Anyone who knows us can tell you that, maybe that's why I've stayed with them for so long. All of my middle school friends and others I was so similar to, and I never hang out with them anymore. Of course our differences can be annoying, yes we fight a lot, and sometimes one of you really freaks me out (and you know who you are) but then we forget about it within a few minutes. That very much reminds me of my sister. We used to do that all the time. We'd tell each other to go to hell, get out of my life, etc...and then forget about it the next day. We two are very different. And I know she reads this now, so I'm not going to say anything mushy, but you know Robin, I like you now. And I didn't really go into this with much thought, and it seems like I should end this with something like "friends are friends but real friends are family" as that would seem to fit, and to an extent I believe that, but lately I've just been thinking a lot about friends, as I know a lot of people have been, and I just don't see too many that I think will last past high school, and that's sad, and I do hope I'm wrong. But I'm convinced you can never replace the whole "can I play with you" scene you went through as a kid, and it's weird to think that all of my really good friendships started like that,  making sand castles on the playground, so simple, I find that kinda cool. I have just now convinced myself that elementary school (not high school) are truly the best years of your life. And again, I don't really have any closure to this, my thoughts often don't, but I've been thinking about that stuff for a while, and I just needed to write (type) it down. I really need to consider a normal journal, these are the kind of things I wanna read 30 yrs. from now. I have a funny feeling this blog will be long gone by then.   Big day tomorrrow, good night.

      Also, it can't be YOUR state of nature because if it belonged to you it would not be a state of nature. That's what a state of nature if all about, not belonging to anyone. Sorry my friend but you are WRONG.

      It can still be a state of nature and be named Sharonland. The name of a country has nothing to do with whether or not it's a state of nature. Just because it's named after me doesn't mean I would take over. I think anyone would admit Sharonland is a better name than "State of Nature".

      Saw Big River wed. night, I had no idea what is was gonna be about and it turns out it was the story of Huck Finn (in musical version, strange...but it did work), convenient as how we just read the book. Not a bad show, HOWEVER LONG it may have been,  it was done really well and I recommend it. Once again I was reminded and extremely annoyed at the unnatural amount of talent Enloe has in the peforming arts. Their orchestra rocked...it made me remember why I quit band. Twas a fun night.  SAT's this mornin, which meant waking up EARLY on a SATURDAY! Not just early but very early, like 6:30 early. Not cool.   Broughton is big, I had to ask for directions 3 times, it was really dirty, and I truly think there was no air conditioning. But on the bright side the test was fairly easy. Some of the vocab. got me, but I just kept waiting for the readings and math to get harder....and they didn't. Lots of people from RCHS there, lots and lots.   Then, pizza. I love I love NY pizza.    My dad and I also went to the Readers Corner on Hillsburough after the test... that store is really awesome. They had every book we had to read for English for half the price, and they had CD's for $1, yes ONE dollar.  I used to hate that place when I was little, it always kind of  freaked me out, I'm not really sure why...maybe it's because it kinda smelled. But I liked the smell today...old booky smell.

      Just got back from tae kwon do, apparently I'm on the sparring competion team now, or the "dream team" as Master Lee likes to call it. It sounds pretty cool, I'm looking forward to it. Sparring is so awesome, it's full contact fighting for all of you who don't know. You go and put on all this equipment, and you look like a marshmallow man, and then you just fight people. You always get hurt some how or another, my first time I got kicked in the jaw...hard, but somehow it's always fun. It makes the non-contact that we do in the regular classes seem really dumb. But yeah travel, competition....great stuff.  In other news, I'm going to VA tomorrow to visit everyone. My niece if 5 months now...and she has 2 teeth, and almost crawling! yayyyayyay! My teeth however are annoying me, I keep cutting my tongue on one of them, it's strangely very sharp.   Farewell

      I was looking back through the archives of this and I realized I have now had this blog for a YEAR! Even though a lot of you have had one for so much longer I thought that was pretty cool. It also made me think of last year... I loved sophomore year, I miss it.

      I got this e-mail from a friend a long time ago, and just yesterday I was scrolling through some of my old ones and found this. I don't think it meant much at the time, but it does now...    Paul Harvey Writes:   We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse. For my grandchildren, I'd like better.   I'd really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meat loaf sandwiches. I really would.   I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated.   I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car.   And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.   It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old dog put to sleep.   I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.   I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother/sister. And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room,but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him.   When you want to see a movie and your little brother/sister wants to tag along, I hope you'll let him/her.   I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town where you can do it safely.   On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom.   If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one.   I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.   When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head.   I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a boy\girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like.   May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.   I don't care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.   I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma/Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle.   May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.   I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your neighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at Hannukah/Christmas time when you give her a plaster mold of your hand.   These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, it's the only way to appreciate life.

      Man things have been weird lately. So much stuff is happening, I think if I were older I would have a mid-life crisis. We had to put my dog Ruby to sleep yesterday. She was really sick, and my dad said she was suffering, so I'm glad she's not anymore, but she's been a part of this family since I was like 5. I really loved her and man am I gonna miss her. I get really attachted to my pets...I'm just happy I got to see her in the hospital. There's been a lot of death lately. Ruby, my buddy from Tae Kwon doe, my cat Patches...geeze I can't handle anymore. I try to be optimistic, but thinks just keep happening and I end up getting dragged down again. I know I say it a lot and these words get thrown around all the time, but at the moment...life sucks.

      I love Tae Kwon Do, it's my only escape nowadays. I just go there and forget about everything...but then it all comes racing back into my mind the moment I step out of there. Everyone there is so nice too. I don't know what I would do without it right now.   And I got my red belt.

      I saw Mandy's detailed account of her 3 day break so far, so I thought maybe I would make one too. Not to copy, but I too would like to look back and see if it was profitable break. Ok this is what I've done so far.  Friday: -Made it out of school- I had a 4 movie day, those are quite rare. It felt like the last day of school. -My mom picked me up b/c she needed my car, Mandy came with us, we went to Mellow Mushroom. -Due to a genius lie on my part (If I do say so myself), we got my mom to take us to Cold Stone, even though we were full.  -went to Lowe's Food (s?) -took Mandy home -drove myself to Tae Kwon Do at 7, went to my class then went to Sparring. (double class= stupid) -Had a weird sparring class, I sprained my ankle and like blacked out and couldn't breathe. Not fun. -went home, iced my ankle, actually had time to pleasure read, and went to sleep at like 10!  Saturday: -woke up, 8:45ish -called Mandy and Andy to wake them up -got ready and picked up Mandy -drove to Andy's and tried to get her to come to the Ren. Faire with us, it didn't work. -drove with Mandy to the Ren. Faire. Walked around the flea market a lot looking for the Ren Faire,  (both of us with sprained ankles), and feeling kinda dumb. We couldn't find it despite all of the signs, which we only saw when we were leaving (where is gate 8?) -we both bought some cool stuff at the Flea Market. There were these beaded bracelets for a dollar and I think I got 8. And I got this turkish thing, and...pencils, weird ones. -drove back to Andy to go to Crabtree (she came this time) -drove all around the freakin mall to find a parking spot, found one in BELKS not HECHTS. -walked around the mall, and saw Noah and some of the other cast memebers of Chess who were doing a little promotional concert for their show. -won free movie tickets to Briar Creek in some radio thing, too bad I have no idea where that is. -ate and walked around -went back to watch the Chess thing, this is where Mandy and Andy DITCHED me and thought it was funny to stand there and watch me trying to find them in the stores they SAID THEY WERE IN. (we were on our cells and they kept telling me to go to stores in which they would walk away from) -Took Andy home LATE HAHA, and Mandy home BEFORE CURFEW. -came home to see Forrest and Robin with Bailey and I played with my niece. -went to a pig pickin (?) with Robin and her friends. -came home, TV, and SLEEP.  Sunday: -woke up at 10ish -walked downstairs to find like 6 people in the kitchen and everyone wide awake. (my sisters friends had slept over) -made myself a monster breakfast -played with my niece and my sisters friend's baby Hunter which she brought over. -went out with my mom and Forrest and Bailey and Robin. -went to Rex Hospital to show off Bailey to all my mom's friends. -went to Applebees -went to Lowes to show off Bailey to all of Forrest's friends. -went home and watched TV and stuff while Forrest and Bailey and Robin went home. -found out surprising news about my brother-in-laws sister. (baby,16... man) -more TV and stuff -sat down and wrote in my blog about what I've done on my break so far  ....besides my ankle, I am so far fairly satisfied with this break.

      Damn, the last full day of my junior year is over, just a couple more wimpy days left to go. I feel like it's a big milestone, and I should feel some emotion...happy that the years ending, sad that the years ending, I don't know, but for some reason I just don't feel anything. I hope I'm not becoming emotionless, that would suck. Maybe it hasn't fully sunk in yet. This year has been so weird in so many ways. I'm not really sure what I thought of it. This past week has surely been fun though, if only the whole year was like it...I would definitely have some emotion.  What I am sure of, is that I love this song. "Your Song" (the Moulin Rouge version)... I just cannot get sick of it.  I am also sure that I am now officially sick of chocolate cake, that Finding Nemo rocks, that film festivals are cool, and that candy necklaces (won from getting 1st place in the APUSH game...hell yeah) are better to look at than eat.

      Life after AP exams is good. We're doing abosultey nothing useful in those classes, which rocks, but we do deserve it. APES takes the lead by far, today we went outside and played some challenge game, that had nothing to do with environmental science at all. It consisted of reading people's minds, jumping on walls, and Harry Potter. Ms.Brongo rocks, that class is so much fun with her.  It's thundering, I love thunder. Especially those really loud claps that scare the hell out of everyone...scared people are funny. And it DID rain today.  I have to make food for history tomorrow...  my thoughts are so spontaneous.

      I like this new blogger set up, new templates..woohoo! For the record, I had this one first, before everyone else started getting it. (Which will inevitably happen) I like this one, maybe I will update more now.  In other news, AP's are OVER. I don't even care that I don't think I did well. Actually I do, I'm just trying to make myself not care because I can't do anything about it. Common sense definitely did not guide me through APES as I thought it would. Sigh. (I really did just sigh)  This weekend should be fun. Busch Gardens never lets one down. Neither do nieces. Yayayayyyy.  Survivor finale ROCKED. Actually is was kind of predictable, but it was really sweet none the less. I think I'm gonna vote for Lex. Too bad only like three of you know what I'm talking about. I would write about it, but I know most people don't care...which blows me away still.  My sun burn still hurts. But I don't think it will give me cancer, it's beginning to fade. Thanks for the concern though Melissa.   School is done in less than a month. Then we will be seniors, then we will be in COLLEGE. Duke I hope, I doubt, but I hope. Senior year will be nice. No more Ms.Schitz, no more APUSH, psychology, drama production, nice to have a few things to look forward to.   My brother just spit on my dog. My 26 year old brother. Now my dog is trying to lick it. That is gross.  Okay well, that's all I have to say now. Hope your happy Robin.

      I was looking through some of my old blog entries and it made me really glad I started this thing because it brought back a lot of old memories I had forgotten about. I noticed I used to write a lot more and I enjoyed reading my long entries, so maybe I should start that again. I started this thing in the middle of sophomore year. I remember how fun that year was for me. I really think I've grown a lot though. I wish so much I could go back with the knowledge I have now, it would change so many things. I wish I could have appreciated it more back then. That's one thing I've never liked about myself, I often never really appreciate things until they're gone.

      I was really happy today. I don't really know why, it was just one of those days where everything makes you laugh and you just can't be in a bad mood. Even though I couldn't go to the lake and my instructors about killed me at tae kwon do, nothing was bringing me down. Those kind of days have been rare for me lately, so it was definitely a nice change. Well that's it for right now.

      I was in a play tonight. I had this like one minute walk on part in "The Man Who Came to Dinner" playing at the University Theatre. It was something that everyone on the theatre board was doing, some kind of cameo thing for the members, I don't know but the manager of the theatre loves me and asked me to do it and my dad was doing it too so he made me. I really didn't want to, it was just a stupid little part and I didn't feel up to it, but my dad really wanted me to and it's "Father's Day" so I did it with him...and it actually turned out fun. I need to start being more open to the oppurtunities thrown at me. I mean, I got to dress up like a convict and wear handcuffs, (that I got out of) how awesome is that! -and no that was not sarcasm. Fun fun great fun. One thing I realized is that I really love being on the stage. It's such a thrill. I'm hoping this production class next year will be cool because I am definitely looking forward to it.   And then we went to I Love NY Pizza. That was cool too.   And did anyone else realize how much good stuff was on TV today? I think the Sci-Fi channel is once again rising up on my list of favorites. I watched Village of the Damned, Jeepers Creepers (not a good movie I know, but still entertaining), AND Urban Legend. Final Destination was on too but I missed it.   And I finally got my camera developed with all my prom pictures on it. Too bad it was like a 34 picture camera and only about 12 pictures came out, and only about 5 from prom. Oh well. There's always next year. And there were a couple good ones.    And I think my dog as ADD. But I love her for it.   I like how random my thoughts are...no connection whatsoever.    (Most of that stuff was boring I know....sorry, I just typed and that's what came out)

      I love naps, very much so, but man do I hate that weird feeling when you get up. Like you don't know what day it is, or where you are, and think it's morning and time for breakfast when it's like 10:00pm, and how you can never fall asleep that night because you got too much sleep during the day.  Weird stuff. Anyways, I have that feeling now.

I locked myself into my parents room upstairs and turned up the TV extra loud to block out the barfing noises.   My family is so weird.

      I have decided I am not going to waste my money anymore. Not that I mean to waste money, but I'm just going to be more careful about it. I used to be so good when I was little, I'd save up tons of money at a time, my mom was often confused as to how I had so much. Yes I would never spend money in excess...such a good little Jew I was. Ever Since I've started to drive I've gotten really bad with it. I think most of my money goes to Cold Stone...man that's pathetic. But it's summer, I need cash and there are so many things I want. I need get some good CD's for one.  I have concluded that this summer I must:   -Not eat out as much. (unless someone else pays) This includes Cold Stone, which will be the toughy. I'm addicted to that place, but I must get off of it.   -Be more crafty. So many people are making their own things now. Scarfs, (scarves?) jewlery, clothes, I need to learn how to do stuff like that. Hand made things are always cooler anyways. I made a necklace this morning, it turned out pretty well... definitely a start.  -Keep my room clean. Alright I don't know how much money this will save me, but it is definitely something I must do. It's so much more comfortable when it's clean, but by the look of it you could never tell I can't stand messes. (I'm considering huring a maid with all the extra money I'll be making)  -Not get in trouble. Again, this might not save me money, (besides the fact that it will lower my chances of getting my allowance taken away) but I always end up spending a good portion of summer grounded or in some sort of trouble. This will not happen this summer. Must be good.  -Save my allowance. I get a good allowance, I must save. It's hard though, it's almost like I have an obligation to myself to spend all the money I have in my wallet. Must get out of that. Maybe I should hide it from myself.   -Get a job. I basically have one waiting for me, I just have to get up and go. I will not sit around and do nothing all summer. Must be productive.    Other things I must do this summer:  -get up to Busch Gardens at least twice. Now that I have the awesome season pass I must make sure to utilize it.  -attend tae kwon do AT LEAST twice a week. I tend to get lazy and just decide not to go...can't do that. -make sure to take advantage of my neighbors pools -get my after nine -start early on the summer reading -not get lazy and not go to Rex every Thursday -be sure not to wake up in the afternoon -get lots of new CD's with all my acquired money -go through all my clothes and give away the stuff I don't wear -go to Winston-Salem and hang out with Melissa at Governer's school-have lots and lots and LOTS of fun without doing anything I regret. (that should cover the rest)

      School soon. Not quite sure what I think yet. Of course senior year is nice, the big year. Just one more to go. But still, a another whole year at Charter...mixed emotions...like always. Last year wasn't that great for me, sophomore year was awesome, so I'm thinking maybe every even numbered year will be good. I do have a couple classes I'm looking forward to so that should be nice. I still have a LOT of that summer reading stuff to do though, one more whole book (not counting like the 10 I am SUPPOSED to be reading for drama) and a bunch of essays. Everyday I tell myself I'll work on them, but what do ya think happens? Nothing of course. But oh well I know a lot of people are in the same situation. I remember last year at this time I was killing myself while trying to get through that Founding Brothers book...oh my can't think of that too much, you know just looking at the cover still makes me cringe.   Ahh well it is now 1:40pm and I'm just now going to go take a shower to start my day. That my friend, is summer.

      I got home from my Key Club retreat about a week ago, and although I DID in fact make a post about it, the computer froze and it got deleted and I have been a bit delayed in my re-post. But I've had requests to update so here it is:  Well anyone that didn't know, I went to some Key Club weekend retreat for the executive board members of a bunch of the local key clubs. I had no idea what to expect, but it actually turned out pretty fun. It ended up being at a beautiful cabin in the middle of NOWHERE (the nearest store was 20 minutes away) on the shore of Lake Gaston. There were like 20 something representaives from I think 6 of the local high schools, and everyone turned out to be really fun. We all ended up bonding pretty well. We had to play all those "summer campy seemingly stupid but fun anyway teamworky" kind of games- yeah you know the kind. Those were fun but we had to talk about our clubs A LOT which wasn't all that fun. But we also got to go tubing and water skiing on the lake which WAS FUN. But yeah overall it was a pretty successful weekend.  One really important thing that I got out of it was that our key club in the past has been so extremely bad, not an accurate representation of key club at ALL, (the kiwanis club basically hated us it was so bad) and that by being president this year I have the chance to bring it back up to par. We have a lot of things planned, even some stuff with some of the other high schools, and it's gonna be a really fun year. We have a goal of 20 members per class to join, so I really hope all of you that are reading this would consider joining. The whole K-family (ask if you don't know what it is) is a really awesome organization that does some really great stuff. So JOIN KEY CLUB. Please, it's not only fun but if you're active than it's really rewarding. If you have any questions or have no idea what it is or something, just talk to me.

      SombrousKnight: you seem to be a fairly confident person who is pretty satisfied with her life but still wants more and somewhat nitpicky  SombrousKnight: I can also analyze that you jump to conclusions   ...wow he's good.

      You know what they just came out with? Now this really pisses me off, I don't even know really know the full extent as to why this pisses me off, but it does. Anyways...LIGHT STARBUCKS FRAPUCCINO'S! What the hell!! You can't alter a frapuccino! That is WRONG. All this weight watching crap out there is really starting to piss me off, and I'm gonna laugh when Mandy is right and all of you carb-counting, yogurt for breakfast eating, being skinny obsessors DISAPPEAR. Why can't you just excercise and lay off the doughnuts when needed? Don't make America change everything to cater to your weight problem. I mean McDonald's has heart monitors in their Happy Meals now. What is that?  Now it's not that I'm against restaurants and fast food places serving healthier foods, but it just seems like they're the ones getting blamed for America's obesity crisis. When it's comes down to it, it's not the restaurant's fault for serving the food, it's the customer's fault for stuffing themselves with it.  Everytime I see someone with a Starbucks LIGHT Frapuccino, I will laugh. Because it is dumb. It's not hard to do a couple more sit-ups at night. What's the point of getting one anyways, there's no whipped cream, and EVERYONE knows that's the best part.  Maybe when I'm a little older, with a really slow metabolism, maybe then will I pay attention to all this carb counting crap and appreciate things like Light Starbucks Frappucino's, but until then, I like my french fries and frapuccinos just the way they are.     And light up shoes for teenagers...DEFINITELY something America needs.

      My birthday is soon. Just over a week, it's the 11th for all of you who were wondering. (and if you weren't wondering you should have been) But anyways I was talking to Andy about some old birthday party experiences. They made me laugh, as we have both had quite a few interesting ones. It made me wonder if anyone else looks back at their birthday parties as negatively as I do. I mean it was no one's fault but mine really, I always HAD to have a sleepover with ALL my friends. Even the ones that didn't known each other, or worse...didn't get along with each other. But anyways I always had like 10 people sleep over. And 10 "tween" (this was mostly late elem. school) girls NEVER get along for the whole night.   Not to mention I was a total control freak, and yes I can admit this now. I always made people do what I wanted them to do. This usually meant everyone getting into pajamas at a certain time, (usually when I got into mine, it never really felt like a sleepover party unless everyone had pajamas on when I was litle) getting everthing pre-approved by me, (I remember a certain time when a friend wanted to watch a movie at 2am...well I was tired...that was NOT going to happen), having everyone sleep where I wanted them to sleep, and all in all I didn't like it unless I wasn't the center of attention and I had say over everything. Alright I was a bratty kid at times.  And then there was my sister. (sorry Robin, I love you now but I hated you at my parties) She always messed everything up. Like when I was trying to keep the whole group together at my pool party because not everyone was a good swimmer (we were in the shallow end), but then she comes along and takes half of us into the deep end with her. And then when you gave everyone makeovers and made me look really bad...that was mean Robin. You always stole all my friends away.  And then there was the location issue. I ALWAYS wanted more than anything to have my party at some cool place, like the Ice House or a hotel or something. But no, we always had to have it at the pool because it was the cheapest. Which makes sense to me only now, (I mean paying for 10 people to get into the Ice House isn't cheap, and those hotel parties...come on) Not that I didn't like the pool, but I had a pool party for like 5 years straight. It got old.  And then there were trick candles. Which at my parties meant friends helping me blow them out. Which meant my friends would end up spitting all over my cake. Yes my parents remember this as well...yes Mandy I have proof.  I just find it funny how year after year I continued to have these elaborate sleepover parties where year after year I always ended the party either up in my room crying, sleeping by myself in my bed where everyone else was downstairs, having people be mad at me, or just wanting everyone to leave.   I mean don't get me wrong, I loved birthday parties. They were so fun when you were little. So much preparation would go into them. And the preparation was the fun part: the guest list, the gift bags, the exact plans, etc... I'd start planning months ahead of time. Speaking of gift bags, mine were always the best. (these were very important to me, I was the kid that would sit there and wait until someone gave me my bag before I would even think about leaving the party...never the kid that left theirs) My parents always made sure it was a good time, and I always ended up having fun for the most part. Plus they created lots of memories and pictures which only make me laugh now. And no one ever threw-up...at one of my parties anyway. (I had to put it)  But anyways the approaching birthday always brings back these times. I haven't even thought about having a party. And again by party I'm meaning having a couple friends over. (I did learn my lesson...possibly the reason I've always been anti-party at Sharon's house) But anyways that's where I'm gonna end it. And if anybody has any good birthday ideas, or comments, or funny stories, please do share them with me.
