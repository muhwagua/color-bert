      A Poem about Vincent:

You dreamed I was an architect 
student.
  I couldn't stay with you because
I was going to be late for class.
But you wanted me to stay.

We had walked much of the
   previous day.
And it wasn't cold because
  we held hands.
We became buildings of our own.

      Just showed my mum how blogs work. She couldn't read the log properly (going blind) and didn't really think it was too amazing ("It's amazing what you can do these day" and walked out of the room) Hmmm, maybe I'll keep sending her reminders to visit my page! Anyways, keep going girl!

      It's so hard to think exactly what I want to write. I try to be very clean and precise with my typing, grammar etc, and I dread pressing the 'publish' key. It's too exact. I have to try to remind myself to use this more often. I love diaries, what the hell is wrong with the computer one? It is the 'real' publish-ness that I am feeling, I think. I'll be more carefree later, I'm sure. These initial stages just feel a little strange.
WELL, then! see you later!

      I have a slight sickness (only nasal) and am of course in the country. The only time I ever have to blogg stuff is here, because it's sooooo boring. I am hoping that I won't get bored after a few months, the job is still fun city and totally interesting. Unfortunately Debbie goes on long service leave soon, and then I'll be left to fend for myself, however fortunately, GEORGIA becomes my morning presenter, and therefore we are a team until Deb gets back. I hope so. Because I have a thing for Georgia, but don't tell Vincent. Actually if Georgia is in the job, I shall have to tell Vincent, it's fair. Ohhhh, I have got a big crush on Vincentino! I can't wait to see him tomorrow. Last week, when I saw him at the bar, after not seeing him for a few days I almost had a heart attack he was so spunky!

The other best news: Vincent is a sweetie pie.

      Maybe I should give this page to my friends in Melbs, so that they can keep up to date. It just seems a little self-centred, don't you think? That I assume my friends will be getting out of touch with what  I   am doing. I don't feel the need, and I'm sure they don't even mind too much. !

      It was my first day at ABC Gippsland today. Not a lot happened, but it was a good show, I arranged an interview with this woman that Debbie found. Successfully. I suppose. Anyway, I am here for another two days, with not a lot to do, so I'm trying to fill the time up with all the things that I've been meaning to do for ages. Like empty my mail (e), and update my blogs, and watch a hell of a lot of cable. Yeah. It's all good.

      Ohhh, the country. The wide screen of mum and dad's computer. Hmmmm.
Anyways, I'm really not too sure about things down here. Firstly, I am depressed about EVERYthing, but mostly my job. I wish that I was learning more about stuff, than the CSAs and the rundown and blardy blar. It's boring. I wish I were king of the whole sham.
Anyways, I've had an awesome jam packed weekend etc. Because of my birthday, and our house party and every thing. That's another reason why I am so depressed, yeah. whatever. I'm a dickhead!

      Just updated some of my favourite sites. I love the Jeanette Winterson site, she's very comfortable with using the web, it seems! Cool!
Well, I've been working at the ABC again today down here in Sale. And I'm the most boring-est person on the planet.
I am not enjoying myself, or learning anything, down here. Well, I don't know about it, really. I just keep coming back, and nothing ever changes. I hope that the election will mean more exciting stuff. Like if the candidates down here change, I'll have to get their phone numbers & record them in my contacts book. Yeah.
I'm working at Khok again this weekend, back on track, with no life, no money, no prospects.
Only good smiling friends.
What more does one need?

       urlLink  Maybe this will work  , I suppose it doesn't really matter, because it's often too scary and distracting from essays (see below). I have gathered all my results from uni, and am no getting my Honours Year (in Media) application together. It's going to be a killer (I hope!). This is the Uni I'm trying to get into for my honours year  urlLink rmit  and I'm hoping all goes well there. I'm loving my place of employment to bits, but am sick of the country style that accompanies it. Actually it's not so bad! ARGH I'm so confused!

But it has been beautiful! The air is like a soggy Christmas Day, and the heat of the weekend has lingered to Tuesday! (today) I went for a spot of Gardening with Mama, but then the rain came a bit too strong to see the weeds! I have been netbanking and emailing at the moment. Not to mention:  urlLink doing the age crossword  which is always great! Oh Well, I'll check my layout (serious changes here at my blog every week!) and then bust a move back to the garden!

      I'm in Gippsland.
I ate cous cous for lunch, and watched a bit of a spanish film on World Movies. I worked this morning at ABC, and everything was great there.
Since I've been accepted for Honours at RMIT, I've had chats with my managers, and I've applied for unpaid study leave, for at least ten weeks. I'm enrolling tomorrow, and shall hopefully find out all the correct dates. It's all going to work out, how fantastic! My bosses' boss said that he didn't want to lose me (at work), and he didn't want me to miss out on the opportunity of doing my honours. Yay! Pretty cool.
Just requested a song for my friend Haley at the radio station where ALICE works  urlLink 1242 3TR . Hopefully Haley is listening tonight!

      hey, i'm listening to Morrissey on the computer - 'your arsenal'. i'm checking my email, paying my mobile bill. Catherine came home earlier with loads of costumes for the film she's working on, and then Dean just came home, riding his bike! (he just asked me if his boyf. Brett had been home... but no! i haven't seen him!) i'm going to look for information on Deleuze's Cinema and why the hell he started writing philosophy about it! it's tricky, but i have some more information to look for. We just got back from Syd. last night. We watched the latest episode of Buffster, before we went to bed (V. C & i) and it was pretty good! Yeah! i have rowing in the morning and then work at the place i've worked at before in port melbourne. should be ok, i'll be able to do some reading, because people will be out of the office..... yeah!

      Hi there! I'm at the Internet Cafe in Heidelberg (sp?) and looking for actors agencies on the web. no that many are up with it! Here is the one i went and had a little interview with  urlLink DG Actors Management  they are in Prahran, and maybe a little out of my league. but that's not positive is it? i'm a super doopa star! here is the website i built yesterday too  urlLink Stratford Reunion . it's lovely for the older women who will be the ones looking at it! 
Ok, my question for today.... here's the scenario: Often before (mostly after) blogging i look at the blogs which have recently been updated: if i see something i like i MAY consider contacting them (extremely rare possibility, because it would only be if they mentioned Morrissey or Douglas Coupland). But this leads to my question..... if anybody out there clicks on my blog when i update it recently. if someone does now PLEASE email me: emilylloyd@hotmail.com.
Just Curious.

      hi there, i'm very tired - because the buffy series final was on last night, and it went for two hours. i loved it, and i was so happy at the end, because after everything that spike endured, he was granted a soul - 'his former self'. hahahaha, amy knew that was going to happen. so i wonder now if he'll be a vamp like angel, or an actual human without superhero powers. like xander. oh well. he's a spunk anyways.
so yeah, since i had work this morning - i'm pretty tired now.
just read through james' blog & and although i'm really happy that i can read it here in the country - he's done so much work. I haven't really done any work.... my problem so far is letting myself be a fool, or feel like a fool, when i'm not really. how can i be clumsy? how can i be a fool? i haven't read stuff & felt compelled to write about it yet.

anyways, grumpiness aside, everything else is fine. Vincent and i are going along really good. we saw battleship potemkin at the astor last sunday. and i just booked my derrida documentary today (as part of  urlLink the film festival ) so that will be great for next week. i'll start working abc tues - thursday from next week onwards, and i'll test the waters after another month. i've been there for a month so far, and whilst today isn't a great indicator (buffy tired) i'm pretty happy there at the moment. in a month i'll be able to see how good i'm going....

i'm off to have a bath, or something. maybe some food? confused and delirous today. good thing that the full moon was this morning - hopefully tonight won't be so bad/.....

oh well, other things are going ok: napier street rocks, it's cute, and getting summer time up there (we went to the fitzroy baths on sunday arvo) so that's lovely.
my cutie vincent is going lovely too. he's working hard at complete post, and getting loads of jobs. he's coming down for this weekend, to take country photos and enjoy some fresh air. i think he and dad are building a futon base.?? 
the best thing in the whole world is that Morrissey is coming soon, OCT 15, and i bought amy and my tickets on friday. so we're definetly going~!!!!

      SO! Time to get into personal blogging!

Firstly, I'm still kicking myself that I have finished uni - having completed honours. i was at school for five years - but heaps of years before that even! I've not really had a relax since actually - because my job started pretty much straight away. 

I've enjoyed being there full time so far. I'm certainly spending more time with work people - which i didn't really have the chance to properly engage with before. a bit of a shame, because they are really nice. Deb's still away on leave - so it's mostly Peter, Mark and sometimes Gez in the morning - and then all the guys go home and then it's all girls in the afternoon. The best thing was talking with a new media guy called Dave Lane and the Backyard coordinator Rae Allen - they've put me in touch with a few good headstarts! Firstly who does what in Victoria, and then the backfence email list - where you can ask questions and post info for others. i got a great 'clipper' program installed - where every cut and paste you do will automatically re-align itself - for occasionally in 'Wallace' there are lines that scatter etc. this thing neatens them up, and how cute is the name of the program 'clippy' - oh so cute.

This week i've spoken with Vincent quite a bit - the little dear heart. and i spoke with Catherine yesterday, and she's going ok - said that Amy's not quite better yet - so that's a bit bad... 

I've started making Granny's skirt for Alice's wedding and i finished the wraps off last night. should be good. now i'm totally sounding like a geek (weddings for gods sake) so i'm off.

      Hi there, how long has it been? 

So much for being bored in the country, it's been  almost  the opposite. I see that my last post was in February and I think I was doing a search for DVD's (Calamity Jane) to buy, and that would've been because my brother bought me a dvd player for Christmas...

But I've found that I love buying DVDs but never really sit down and watch them... I like hiring them out (instead of videos) with Vincent and I really like watching all the extra bits (Zoolander was good). But the buying thing... Everytime I walk into JB Hifi (which isn't really often these days - as I'm not in the city and there's  so  not one here in Sale) I look at the Buffy Collection or the other movies. And I really really really want to have a DVD fund to save up for all the Buffy collection ones, but will I really watch them? Do i have time?

 Vincent  wants me to eat soup with him now... cute boy.

      Hi there,

I've moved into my new house in town and I'm using Daniel's computer - yay!

I'm actually home sick today (although I'd probably be home at this time anyways) as a few people at work are ill, I caught one of their colds!

I've got Rocky Horror rehearsals tonight, I'll take Ned over this time. It's good so far, a huge bunch of people and lots of smiley faces! It'll be great to put the show on. I'm Janet Weiss, and hopefully we'll do a song that I'm in tonight! Last week was 'Time Warp' and of course Janet doesn't do anything for that!

We'll see!

Anyways, apart from being slightly ill, I'm going along ok. My boss was sick yesterday, so we just mucked around and had fun. I really hope everything works out with this guy, he's kind of weird and although we have heaps of weird people at work, he hasn't really settled well so far. hmmmmm.

Oh well, I'm really going to TRY to write things in my blogs. Maybe the problem is that I've got too many, and too little time to write things in. Maybe also because I dont' really have a blog community to be involved in.

I know Vanessa at work is pretty into blogs, the time she came down she said she was catching up with friends by reading their blogs.... that's pretty cool, but none of my friends blog!

I tried to get Vincent into them, and although he was really excited by it and stuff, he just completely forgot about it when i left him to himself.

Haley came over before to hang out a little and she's going to go to Italy next year for sure!

      It's a gloomy but warmish Sunday here in Sale.

I've woken hot with Vincent, after quite a restless night for the both of us. His head was busy and I was just too hot under the covers, and wanting to hug him, but getting way too hot for hugs and so my sleep was muggy.

I read over some of Jill's novel again - and she's pretty good at telling a great story. I've heard some of the stories before but her writing style is quite good I guess.

Then Vincent and I watched Buffy - Pangs. Where Xander gets syphillus, and Buffy just wants Thanksgiving to be perfect.

That's only the second time I've watched that ep. because I think when it went live on channel seven I may have missed that ep in particular, but I've seen most of the others before in that box set. Unfortunately the video story sold me the 16:9 instead of the usual 4:3 - and apparently Joss told everyone that the 16:9 is the Warner release and he didn't like it or approve of it. 

Anyways, I may have to get the next half of series four soon because I can't wait for: Tara to arrive - I didn't like her much the first time round but having known her a bit better after two or threes years now, I want to see her again. I was waiting for her to be bad the first time round. Just not wanting to trust her - was I siding with Buffy? I was I just waiting for a demon to walk out of her body. New people on Buffy take a while to build up trust with me (and other characters I guess), but how strange that I liked Spike straight away, even though he killed anything, and not someone like Tara.

I also can't wait for us to be over Riley, he's such a nong. 

And I can't wait for Vincent to watch that 'Something Blue' episode - maybe we can squeeze it in before we go today - he's at a massage now. hopefully having a good time.

I'm going to search buffy sites now to see what that WD or WP - sticker means.

      Just lost a really boring post, it was full of lists. Lists I will never read again, Lists I will never really need again. 

It went along the lines of... buy Claire some paw paw cream before going overseas and give v-man lots of kisses on the weekend. Typical, and the above was the good part. 

I'm still trying to locate my voice in all of this blog. I think because I have such short snippets of writing, bursts of blogging inspiration like every three or four months, I lose my online writing sense of being. I loved it when I was at uni (the good old days) and harped on about whatever stuff... although I've looked ( urlLink http://honours.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_honours_archive.html )&nbsp;at what i used to write at uni and it's really boring, this is the most interesting page I've ever written. Shito really. 

I'm leaving to play spider solitaire some more before I go back to work.

      Funny blog from Melbourne...

I've just read the funniest post, and I think it's because I knew about the content. I wonder if you just read other blogs forever without familiarity you'll feel lonely and lost. I read this person's blog and just have to link to it -  urlLink http://reasonsyouwillhateme.blogspot.com &nbsp;Ms Fits is the person behind the writings, and I've just found out she (perhaps?) is small - well she seems to know a lot about being small anyways.

Har Har, I may write comments to her messages in the future if they are funny again... Go blogger, it feels like spying on other people's lives and I keep forgeting how fun that is. And I also keep forgeting what tone to write my posts in... Do I write as if I am reading it? Do I write to Vincent? Do I write to the unknown reader? Do I really care?

Goodnight, I have to get up for work (don't we all - apart from arts students out there) and it's a bit late for me.

      I'm having a msn conversation with this guy chris who i've met online over three years ago. And we maybe talk once a year. He's ok - but very forward. He lives in Sydney, so that's ok then.&nbsp; He meets people in real life who he meets online, and i've never done that before. I don't really meet that many people online and if I do - i already know them from real life.

 

Anyways, today i went to work, organised the program before Jo left, i did some online type stuff. came home ate a salad and played the Sims again. i'm not really addicted, i would be in the computer was faster! Anyways, i came back to work and the manager really made me mad for some reason - he's so bad at organising things and today i nicely confronted him about a few things here at there... hmmmmm!

I miss vincent badly, so i'll send him a goodbye ether kiss (not ether as in the liquid - as in 'through the ether') i love you darling boy!

      I've been looking around at people's blogs recently and I feel so daggy. I'm so not into blogging and I just want to be into blogging. Nevertheless, I'm writing to say I'm going to Japan and UK in less than three weeks! So maybe I'll get all ready to blog then! Yippee!

I've moved back to mum and dads, I've been playing spider solitaire because it's really fun and hard to win. Vincent and I have been really busy and seeing movies. 'Closer' screened at the Cannes Film Festival and premiered in Melbourne this festival as well. It was really good, Vincent was worried about one shot but I'm not worried at all. It was lovely and beautiful.

      I've been talking with Vanessa at work (again) and sorting things out for my leave from work.

      And being a little bored I thought I'd look into online computer games. Do you ever get that itching feeling about things you want to google? I feel agitated that I can't remember what I wanted to look up, and I start feeling undernourished or under-real. Like as if because I can't think of something to look up or check up on or explore or discover or smile at, I feel not real. I think that's the equation I'm trying to create here. I don't feel value first off, and then pissed off that I can't think of anything. And thus... >>>  urlLink Do It Yourself Adventure  >>> My sure fire things to look up are online games and free stuff. 
 
I remember the first few months of using the internet in year 12 was to find free stuff. mugs, mouse pads, stickers, key chains. my god it was crappy free stuff. Trent started it and of course I followed eagerly. The search engines were so different then. Yahoo was around, and about five or six other strange names... I wonder if I'll ever remember them... I did have a favourite one. Oh (*sigh*) internet memories.

      I think V would really laugh at this, I laughed a lot and I found it care of my favourite blogger. >>>  urlLink RAMONES NAME GENERATOR  >>> . I wonder if you have to be granted permission by the blogger so that they can become your favourite? Or can I just proclaim that she is my favourite blogger without introducing myself?
 
Confusing, I'm sure. I'm not sure about the lack of paragraphs this setting has created for me, I might log in and change it soon. Work whinge approaching >>> I just can't believe how idiotic my boss is. I wonder how many people around the world can say that? I can't believe some of the things this man does. What is an appropriate name for him? Any ideas anyone? Please leave comments if you can think of a handle. I can't leave any real info about him. I'm too afraid of defamation!!!! Anyways, he's a tosser and that's pretty much all he is.
 
Anyways, I'd better leave it at that.

      Taking a tour around Tokyo on the net, everything seems quite good - people are saying that it's not as expensive as rumours have it.

And installing blog this! onto mum and dad's computer - how else would i get by? it's getting too late to be blogging, but i just needed to post that link in case i forget the place names. it's going to be pretty hard getting around tokyo... oh well. i'll survive, i'm such a big girl.

      So, there was this tennis coach at a private school in the city. he fancied a 14 year old girl, who fell under his charms. until she was 18 years old. she's now come 'out of the woodwork' to charge the man with having an underage affair (not rape?) and she won in court yesterday. he goes to prison for this last night! i saw in the paper that the jury had more women than men in it, but does this matter. 14 years old isn't an adult, she wouldn't haven't had had a clue. I think you tend to think that you know what's going on then, at that age, but if a teacher (someone in authority) takes that relationship further - that's pretty bad.

There was a young woman with this man in the paper too (walking with him last night on the news) and how would that feel like? A man you're walking with has taken guidence and responsiblity and thrown it away and mistreated trust. A man (maybe she was a sister and not a girlfriend?) you know has (ages ago) done that.

hmmm.
