      ok so i am not going to a boarding school any more i am probably going a s*** comprehensive somewhere in a random city that i am not familiar with.   And then there is aileen who is not talking to us cos we were being silly and saying stuff about this guy she keeps going on about and she doesn't fancy him but we were winding her up and now she is stressy.   so life as normal then.

I could be going to a boarding school in september which meens i will be leaving all my cool and friendly friends and i might just burst into tears right here in my latin lesson. It will b so hard but a new expirience all the same.   Damn I need to go now cos i hav to concerntrate for once.  Otherwise i might fail my exam and i can't do that if i wanna get into a good school.  Taraa

       urlLink    This is a homing pigeon that wandered into the gallery the other day. It didn't want to leave, or go home, it was content with staring at its reflection in a mirror - occasionally reaching forward to peck at the glass. We decided to call it Narcissus!&nbsp; urlLink

      Hello u lot it is good for u to add comments cos they do get sent home from the site which is great.  No i am sat in my Re lesson writing about religious paintings It is great fun.  Had a resonable weekend cos my parents got really stressy cos i was barely in the house.  So i had to do a loada stuff which really annoys me generally.  They always assume i don't do my share so iget even more annoyed.   Still havn't spoken to the confusing one and i liked the comment about killing him it makes much more sense then actually trying to talk to him.  No he still hasn't got in touch but it doesn't bother me it meens that i don't actually hav to face my problems until they shout and dance naked in front of me. Lol.   Haa haa haa i am now in latin cos the lessons hav just changed though we are still in the It rooms so i am still riting.  But i need to go seen as i actually hav to get this computer to open more that one thing at once cos it is being slow.   I am back now and my teacheris blabbing on about mysteries which meens i am going to sleep. so umm yep wellas iwas saying well i wan't but neva mind yes umm charlie is my new friendlichen to the site and she will add more posts so u hav more to comment on.   this post is about to be published and so i will say goodbye till another day.   Taraa

      Helloo this is the mightily confused two! (as opposed to ... oh never mind!) I'm here to terrorize this blog ha har!! Ok, i'm only kidding - and anyway i won't have time in between all o' this taking over the world stuff to terrorize measly computer journals. *ahem* ... getting a little carried away. Sorry.  Time to introduce myself.  I am Charlie. This is my Aardvark. I love: my clock that ticks backwards, daydreaming, tea, living in my own little world, jazz music, rock music, being creative (with scissors, glue, paint and paper!) and, of course, Gremlin! I hate: fish, people with their heads stuck up their own *deleted for your protection*, farting, confusing guys, people who don't leave comments (nah, just kidding, honest!), double French and those hamsters that sing and dance to tacky songs. I usually wear blue knickers, and i'm a Saggitarius.  That's me to a tea.  Mmmm... tea.

      Bored in IT. I am supposed to be doing some database work but my teacher isn't here and so i can't be bothered cos non of us no what we are supposed to be doing!  All my mates are injured.  Aileen fell down the stairs how stupid she has a massive bruise on her leg.  Ceci pulled her hamstring durin a rounders game on monday and i went over my ankle and i still hav it strapped up for support! Emma and mary are the only ones who havn't done something to themselves.  So i need to go and do something useful with my time.

      heloooo another day in the life of me. Sat in the it rooms waiting for a teacher.  This is the doss lesson of the day which meens that i can do whateva i want.  Here she is and she won't notice that i am typing away just doing random stuff. so jack has eventually stopped annoying me and it is bliss though boys still touble me.  ross still has the rong idea.  i don't want a relationship but does he know this No!!!  I just guess i hav to go along with it until i finally hav the guts to tell him that i don't want this.   Neva mind

      I'm in the library @ skool!  This is really hard to write though, since the librarian is sitting right behind me and the only time we're supposed to use the school email is to send things home, or if we're asked to do something.  Gracie, you said you posted by emailing i think, but it doesn't seem to have turned up. When you write the emails it seems that you have to use the 'plain text' setting for it to work. Anyway, i'm rambling.  We're supposedly writing a plan and our observations for a science experiment, but i really really don't feel like working. And also this spell-checker thing is driving me crazy with all its stupid capital 'I's and doesn't think i should have two 'really's next to each other. I'm still rambling.  Well, i can't really write an awful lot since this might get 'intercepted'! Hee hee! Damn, it doesn't know the word 'hee' either. Eek!!  Oh, i'm so bored.

      ok, i was honest. i had to go though, so i don't know how he reacted! Here's a part of our conversation; ben's name was "(8) Looking for some hot stuff baby tonight (8) Stop looking, here it is!!! ;)" and he asks me if i agree... -----------------------------------------------------------------  Ben...       watcha think? u know u agree!!!  Ben...       lol   Charlie...   ha ha  Charlie...   :P   Ben...       wat dont u think i sexy?   Charlie...   of course   Ben...       is dat u agree, or u disagree?   Charlie...   i can't tell if ur just joking around or if u serious  Charlie...   (q)   Ben...       course i just joking around  Ben...       but it wud be interesting to know some proper truth!   Charlie...   well, don't ask me!  Charlie...   (alien) i is just some random alien   Ben...       come on i need to know what each of my friends think, so dont be               embarassed to say da truth   Charlie...   you 'need' to know?   Ben...       course i do  Ben...       brb  Ben...       having me tea   Charlie...   k sure   Ben...       stay online tlk to u after   Charlie...   k  Charlie...   ok, so while ur not here i'm going to talk 2 u!  Charlie...   and here's the answer to your question - no, i'm afraid i don't find you               particularly sexy, but if it's any consolation i seem to find very few               people sexy  Charlie...   i hardly ever just fancy ppl :(  Charlie...   of my own accord  Charlie...   i guess i shouldn't ask if you think i'm sexy ((q))... maybe i'm a little               young..?   -------------------------------------------------------------------- Ben didn't come back online before i came off, and i haven't had the chance to speak to him since. I couldn't resist asking that last bit at the bottom... how could i? Hee hee!   By the way the reason i'm not at school today is i'm really not feeling well and i'm all weak and shaking (bleeeeuuugh). Also, i'm posting this by email and i don't know whether it will work or not.

       urlLink    I feel like posting, yet i don't really feel like writing today. I'm so tired. So so tired... i was asked why i have bags under my eyes today. Why? I have no idea! I've been going to bed early, having not done anything homework-wise either (so the teachers just  love  me right now!), and really not being able to drag myself out of bed in the morning. I don't even know why i'm bothering to go into school, i mean, i'm not feeling well half the time. And yet, the other half of the time i feel ok... so there seems no solution. Just carrying on is what i seem to do, and eventually i get better again.  Beth said something quite funny the other day. It was about her brother Stevyn and his friend Ed - Beth told me ages ago they both fancy me, but she told me that she asked Steve since when has he liked me. Steve said that he'd always sort of liked me a little, but when i came up their stairs in my mini-mini-skirt (when they were playing their guitars) they exchanged glances like... :¬o! I just thought that that was soo funny, since i had no idea at the time!  This lead me to think about something i've often wondered; how do you qualify having 'nice legs'? I've never really been able to work it out! ...  Posted by  urlLink Hello   (edited with  urlLink Blogger )

        Phew! *sigh* *slump*  This is the time of day where i fall off my feet and onto my sofa, with a sigh and a cup of tea, thankful that this day has nearly come to an end. Mondays are always like that, but i suppose that today  is  the longest day of the year.  This is the time of day where i stick on some music (Blink 182), drink (the cup of tea), log on and browse my email and the internet for a while. A while becomes ages. I begin to think about the RE homework i didn't do yesterday and have to do for tomorrow, the English 800-2000 word draft of creative writing which was supposed to be in today, and has now to be in on wednesday, the music project i haven't started which is supposed to be presented tomorrow...  And every night i just go around doing nothing in particular because there's the weight of homework, piano / clarinet practice, and other work for people that i haven't done yet hanging over me, and in the end i usually go to bed having done absolutely nothing, then do the homework during breakfast the next morning. It's a funny routine.  I wonder if i can snap out of it; do something different, something productive tonight. It always makes me feel better when i have actually done, or finished, something! Well, for now there's my website - madnosity.com - and that i think i'll work on. Get some stuff done. When it's finished, i'll keep you posted!

      My daddy has excepted to jobby thingie in St Helens.  So we are definatly moving sum time.  Any way not dwelling on the present lets dwell on the past. i got and email last night. From dave godden. he was a guy was building a tower with becci and against charlie he didn't talk to me but got my email off charlie so he could talk to me.  So umm yeah i got back in touch and said that meeting up with him would be a good thing to do so long as we were with other ppl.  We might be meeting up this weekend so yeah that would be funny i guess.   Going back to the present if my parents don't find me a school i will be staying here for the next two years which would be fine and stuff but my parents would have to live apart for the week and only see each other for the weekends.  That would really suck. Never mind We are in the IT rooms doing RE and looking at paintings which is fun but not as fun as writing here. Better go

The day is so beautiful, i'm so happy, wish me luck tomorrow for the public speaking competition but i'm sure i'll enjoy it when i'm there (even though now i'm with Jonathan Temple ... no grace that's not funny!)  dee dee da la la la dum doo la la dum da dum dee dee dum doo daa (BCR song, obviously; Letters to God)  luv u 4 reading this whoever u r, i'm so happy and there is absolutely no reason for it!

      helloooooy again. I am sat in the it rooms waiting for my teacher and we are all bored.  So i thought i would write a post. So i have just had RE and got my exam results back So far my results are...... ( drum roll please! ) Latin ( this lesson!) 59% English 81% RE 81% So my latin exam is really really really really awfull. Never mind.  I am not talking to libby or ross which i think is the best idea seen as they may as well be getting married seen as they already have the rumour spread that they have slept together.  But why??? They have like been together for 3 weeks! Never mind it is nothing to do with me anymore. I don't really care.  They are nothing to do with me.    So anyway Yes.   Ummm no i dunno  So umm yeah Charlie the first weekend in july doesn't ring alarm bells so i think that is fine for the picnic. so umm yeah i shall do some incites and email them u so we can hand them out to ppl who wanna come to our small little town and have a random picnic for those hu are crazy.   So umm i sahll go now cos i have nothing other to do apart from surf the internet  Taraa  Gracie  mwhua xx

       I Wish   I wish i was a crocodile Keeping everyone on their toes, I wish i was an elephant With a HUMUNGUS nose, I wish i had some bright red shoes That could fly me to the moon, I wish that i could, with my mind, Bend a metal spoon, I wish i had a magic wand To summon what i need, I wish i had a frying pan To get rid of that Lee Creed, I wish my bed was really soft Like fluffy cotton wool, I wish my glass of lemonade Was always always full, I wish i was a cheetah And could beat Tim in a race, I wish i could make card castles And NOT put in the ace, I wish my roof was made of glass So i could see the stars, I wish they'd hurry and find a way So we could move to Mars, I wish that all our money Was made of chocolate wrapped in foil, I wish i was a snake And i could wind into a coil, But MOST OF ALL I wish that i, Before the end of today, Could get all of my work done, As it's THEN that i can play!  by Charlie Fothergill (me!)     ...little flash of inspiration there!

      Whooo hoo had a great time last night.  My waltzing has improved due to james' coaching.   I am sure i had my drink spiked i felt soooo like lively until i got in the car and fell asleep on Joe.   Neva mind I am now back in latin lessons and i hate this.  It sux sooo badly.   Any way the bbq in the first weekend sounds ok tho i actually havn't checked my calender so i don't know.   OH YEAH! I remember umm i can get a ticket for greenbelt at £30 from my mate hu now can't go! WHOPPEEEEE! Also i need to talk to hannah about the dweeb gig and see if i can get a lift there.  Then i need to get in touch with becci and ed and see if they wanna go into town sumtime and go see a movie.  That would be fun.  Ed was really evil last night talking about stroking the shrubbery cos it was soft only using it as an excuse to get around me to distract becci.  Ahh well i better go and get on with finding out my exam results  Taraaa  Gracie mwha xxx

      I have been trying to get a couple of pictures up here, just for fun, but it doesn't want to work when you publish a site via FTP. During the last few days i had posted three picture-posts, but now they all refuse to show up anything save a little white box with a red cross inside ... >sigh  There's never an end to computer problems. You know, it was pretty difficult to get this to public via FTP! I can't believe i managed it; i've never tried before.  Anyway, that's enough complaining, i'm going to miss my bus if i'm not careful.  It's so hard not to write 'luv Charlie' cos i finish my diary like that each day. Ah, what the hell.  love The Green Aardvark

      Oh, and by the way, i went to Helen's book and cake sale today; it was quite fun and we sold all the cookies (yay!). But did you know, Gracie, that Joe still flirts? I thought after his chance went at Viney Hill he'd just take no notice of me any more - but he still seems to come and stand close and hint when he talks and stuff. And talks about completely random stuff just for something to talk about. He told me about how they have a river at the bottom of their garden, and a guy lost his shoe into it and the shoe has probably floated up to Cirencester or something by now. You gotta admit, guys can be pretty sweet sometimes! I know i  always  say that guys are sweet, but sometimes they sooo are!!! Like when they wave at you. That's really sweet.  (hee hee, goes off into little dreams about guys)

      I seem to have completely overloaded myself with work that i don't really want to do at the moment. I have some homework that i must do this half term (prob. on sunday night!), i need to finish the pictures for Chris first priority), i have a camera club (yes camera club!)outing on the 13th of June (though that i'm looking forward to!), grade 6 piano on the 16th June (groan!), 18th June is a French language festival where we're doing a couple of songs i have to learn off-by-HEART!!(in french!!) and the 25th June is an English (thank goodness) public speaking competition, like the one i did last year; and last year we won two awards so this year i have a lot to live up to! Plus, i'm speaker this time (real scary!!) but i have Angus as my chairperson so that should be great fun! Though, i'm not looking forward to it. Ah well, at least most of these things give me an afternoon off school! That attempt to cheer me up about these things was in vain. I, quite seriously, need to learn the word N-O, but it's so hard to say no when so many different people are confident you'll do their thing. Argh. Choke.     Despite all this though, i'm not in a bad mood. I'm sitting in my bedroom with the window wide open and the birds are chirping like mad. There are some that go 'chirp chirp chirp chirp...' one that goes 'peep' every couple of seconds and then 'peep peep' and a woodpigeon occasionally calling out in the distance. It makes me feel very at home, since i've always heard the woodpigeons around my house! Also, i have my mini-skirt on (that makes me feel  powerful ) and some new clothes on; which always makes me feel good! And i have been browsing one of my favourite websites;  urlLink  Planet Sark  ! If you're ever feeling blue then give it a visit and, trust me, it will cheer you up no end! Either that, or read some of the beautiful stories and the   StoryPeople  .&nbsp;  Time for a cup of tea i think!
