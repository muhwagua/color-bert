      When you work with people for a good while, a bond grows between you and the others you work with. Often this bond resembles a family, even going so far as having people play certain roles.  We lost one of our best cashiers today at work. Jan had taken off 6 weeks for surgery, and apparently did some job searching while she was at it.  Understandably, she wanted to be closer to home, and she's always lived at least an hour's drive away.  The thing about Jan is that her customer service was top notch, plain and simple.  A toothy grin and inquisitive, "Hi, how are you?" for everybody, be they crotchety old man or haughty middle aged woman.  This departure sets us in a "moving on" mood, and as one employee was heard saying, "Heck of a way to start the year, eh?"  Today as the rain fell down and one of our family members departed for the last time, our smiles felt empty, and our greetings as hollow as a rotted out dogwood tree.

      Christmas was neat this year.  Why, you ask? Because of gifts and free food? No.  The big gift for the year was getting to see my uncle again, who has advanced pancreatic cancer.  So yay there. On to happier things.  Today I'm going to run into town on my one day off of work this week to pay my bills (that's why I work in the first place...I think. It's either that or indentured servitude.) and waste my time somewhere other than in front of the computer. GO ME, ROFFLFOEROLOL!!!!111 And remember, a wet dog might stink, but at least it's cheaper than your stank-ass cologne, biotch.

      I had this long and drawn out thing written about how Christmas should mean more stuff to everybody, but this craptastic thing decided to erase the entire post! So I'm just going to put this one up and tell everybody that reads this to enjoy their holiday season.

      Okay, first things first.  This thing isn't letting me edit ANYTHING. Try to add a link or change the title header, and IE spits up a 404 faster than a frat boy can scream "Whoo!" after downing his fourth....fifth.  So, I'm just going to give some homemade links to a couple of friends and their blogs. Enjoy!  urlLink Andrea James/ARJlog   urlLink Tekniklr/Teri's Blog

      I'm already tired of everybody else giving out links to their blogs to me like candy to a sugar-starved Halloween junkie, so I'm going to do something about it! Only this won't stop people from giving me links to theirs. Well....I guess that didn't work. Either way, I'm here to rant and roll. Those of you that know me should read this. Otherwise I might throw a fit until you do look at it, and believe me--we don't want that.

      Days off are a great thing.  Who's to say it isn't our basic human right to sit on our duffs for a day of consciousness and do absolutely nothing but rest up?  So do the smart thing, take a day off to read a book, go out with your significant other, write a story, sing a song, practice your skills...whatever you want.

      I wasn't invited to anything last night.  Not an inquiry, not a spared glance in my direction, nothing.  I consider myself to be good friends with several people at work, many of whom were going to certain get-togethers.  Not a word.  On top of that, I was expected to do the work of around 3 people today, which isn't unusual, but I didn't need it on top of already feeling manic depressive during the 8 hours of Kiss Customer Ass-athon.  And one of the girls that was supposed to go see The Two Towers this evening (Good movie, go see. NOW, HYAH!) didn't even return my calls after making a horribly weak excuse about having to do her laundry.  During the short drive home that seemed like a long drive, I wanted a deer in front of my car so bad I could already taste the jerky. I wanted to die.

      Somewhere down the line, I have become a horrible monster not even deserving of death.  Whatever crime against humanity it was that I committed, it comes with a horrible, horrible duration of doing penance.  Today that penance was watching my new store manager easily woo the ladies I've worked with for years.  Talk about your "seduced by power" scenario.  Another part of the reparations was cleaning every inch of chrome in the store from top to bottom.  It was like a male Medusa, you scrub the chrome clean until you can see your own face, but you quickly turn away because of what you see there.  The art of being single is quickly becoming it's own satirical work.

      It dawned on me today that I really, really hate driving in inclimate weather.  An extra half hour of walking around the parking lot and the entire campus because of frozen car door locks will quickly change your mind about "how pretty that farking snow is".  Also realized that while some people really do care about what you think and do for them, most people simply wish you would crawl into a hole and die. Especially if you aren't some slack-jawed pretty boy, which seem to inhabit around 2/3 of the earth's surface. Yes, that means they're as common as water.  A flash flood warning indeed.

      Okay, time for a sane update.  Yes, I was sick.  I'm not sure if it was some vague head flu or a sinus infection.  But I'm all better now.  Physically, that is.  I'm finding myself torn between two worlds this semester, and neither of them are that appealing.  On one hand, there is work.  I know the people there, but the environment is simply not conductive to anything resembling happiness, or enjoyment.  On the other hand, school is supposedly an accepting place that takes all kinds.  The problem is, that everybody seems to be the same anyway. Obsessed with image and themselves.  How can somebody feel like they have something unique to contribute when the entire population wouldn't give a fig if you did?  Frustration personified.

      One thing I've learned in the last year is that you should never fall for an overachiever. It only makes you look worse.  When I said I couldn't write anymore, I meant works of fiction and things outside of schoolwork. Surely I can still write some smatterings of social statements solely for satiating your sadistic standards.

      Good frickin' grief, it's been like 3 weeks, and I still can't shake this cold/disease/curse of slow death.  I had to call into work again today, and I know they're getting pissed off at me.  (Oh no, I've called in twice in 2 and a half years, and others call in every other day without getting burned. Yeah, that makes sense.)  School's been hectic too, as we get ready for spring break.  So they like to beat us down before we go on vacation.  Another example of great human instincts. "Here's some work for your spring break so that you can relax. Mwahahaha! I'll go eat shit and die now...you wish! Gyaaahahaha!"  Dicks.

Work and school have been beating me down like Moe's head under the letter press while Curly is twisting the top and making poor Moe's head want to explode. Sorry, Three Stooges reference. Deal with it.  But yeah, I'm likely to be busy for the next couple of weeks too, with finals week rapidly approaching. Ah well, c'est la vie.  Later.

      Weeeeeelll, my ol' buddy ol' pal  urlLink Andrea  decided to link me.  Everyone that reads this should waste their time reading how she wastes her time.  Er, not that she does.  I'm going to be reamed for that...but in a good way.  Water is a constantly original metaphor if used properly, and she uses it so well in her stories and poetry.  If people could be elements,  she would be the blossoming crest of a wave, salty and charged with the power of the ocean's thirst to know the land that it slowly conquers.  I hope that softens the reaming up a bit.

      The first thing I should comment on is my uncle.  They decided to have the funeral visitation today and Tuesday.  This happens to coincide when I'm supposed to be taking finals.  I knocked one of them off today, and I'm pretty sure I did okay on it, hopefully a B.  The fact that I can't go to the funeral has been nagging at me since I heard the news.  The worst part? My uncle's grandson, who goes to the same college as I do, can't go either.  And he has physical ties of blood with the man, and was just generally closer to him.  When he talked to his professor to see if he could go to the funeral instead of taking his final, the professor told him he could take it the "first day of summer school". Vague, yes?  What a dick.

      Today was a cold day.  The weather outside was as dreary as the old man in the frozen tundra, stuck where he is with no hope of survival, the ice slowly working its chilling magic on his aching joints and bones until he at last feels the blistering warm embrace of death.  My uncle, Bob Foster, passed away from cancer today.  It was a cold day.

      Anyone that knows me knows that inspiration for stories springs almost daily from my work at the grocery store.  And why wouldn't it?  Almost no day is the same as the other, with more new elements being tossed into the proverbial salad every 8 hours I work.  Today while I was doing my onerous duty of cleaning the restrooms (The mens, if you must know) I happened upon some pamphlets promoting basic Christian dogma.  Something about the fact that these people have been dropped to the level of leaving the word of God in a public bathroom is simply disturbing.  Is it the hope that while doing those basest of bodily functions, this person will suddenly see the literature lying there, read it, and have a spiritual epiphany whilst doing so?  And in further irony, I have yet to see any of these pamphlets in the women's bathroom at all.  So either the men doing this don't have the nerve to simply dump a couple of the pamphlets inside of the women's door, or they've decided that the women simply aren't worth it. I'm pretty sure that's slightly demeaning.  Seeing colorful pictures of happy people with "Jesus Lives!" or a somberly painted crucifix with "The Second Coming" in boldface above it serves as a background for bathroom brainwashing.  Knowing somebody else would later anyway, I toss the pamphlets in the toilet and flush them with the rest of the human offal.

      Well, the hour grows nigh.  We're leaving bright and early tomorrow morning (Or maybe just early, since the sun might not be up).  I'm not really sure if I'm looking forward to this--every vacation, apart from where we go, seems the same. We see some stuff, get lost a few times on the way, scream at each other, annoy each other, and then come home.  I know they make movies about crap like this, but is this NORMAL? I want to go somewhere and relax, not worry about finding Upteenth Street and Hairy Avenue.  Ah well.  For those that read this.....signing off.

      I forgot to mention that Sherry dropped off a huge freaking bag load of stuff for me to work my way through, i.e. books and even an album she burned (with some weird cover art to boot).  The books are some of these multi-epic series, like Wheel of Time and Sword of Truth, except these mostly seem to be from the 70's, a period in fantasy I know woefully little about.

      Sherry stopped by work today, and despite me telling her multiple times that I wasn't angry at her, I still think she's still thinking that.  The fact is, that if Lisa (woman that's been making my work a living hell of neverending drama for the past weekend) had seen me talking to ANYBODY, and not doing anything for all of 4 seconds, she would have barked off a command of some kind.  I mean, Jesus.  She was giving me somewhere around 2 seconds to bag one order, and then scramble past 4 empty lanes and bag a can of soup somebody bought. So BAG YOUR OWN CAN OF SOUP, YOU PREMIE TRICK ASS CHEESE WHORE! Bam!

      Just got back from another night with Sherry.  I know that people say that variety is the spice of life, but we've pretty much done the same thing for two weeks straight now.  Meet up, go to a park, talk/walk around, do some assorted stuff around town between, and then grab a little bite to eat at-of all places-Sonic.  The funniest thing is that I never get bored doing this.  It's the same routine, but it's definitely not the same trip.  P.S.  Sonic Cream Slushes are the wicky-wicky bomb.

      Well, today was one of my two days off.  Yes, my weekend comes in the early or middle parts of the week.  I didn't do too much except mow most of the yard, which I loathe....and talk to Sherry while she was at work, at least through e-mail a little bit.  I hope it doesn't bore her to death--but hey, if somebody came to visit me at work, or just called to say hello, I'd think it was nice...if a bit weird.  Dad invited me to go to work with him tomorrow up in Lexington, but he'll have to get up really, really early to go there, and tomorrow will almost definitely be my last day off before vacation.

      In some horrible mind game, the teacher of my 5 week summer class had me completely convinced that I was failing everything again, even going so far to say "You should have taken that Incomplete."  Needless to say, this did not sit well...considering that I got a C in the class, which is enough to make sure I go back in the fall.  Not to mention the admonition, "You can write better than this, Jason." Oh, hi. I'm Jarrod.  I  wrote the paper, kthxbi.  Jesus. But at least the 5 years that had been taken from my life have been added back to my sum total of...uh, 32, probably.  At least I won't have to worry about middle aged crises, although a little red sports car would always be nice.  And on the column to the left, I've added a link to Sherry's blog.

      Nightmares always come back, so they say.  Or at least they say that in the B flicks that you see on Sci Fi or TNT late at night.  For me, one of those nightmares was the semester I had to take off from school because of my poor grades. And now, because of an ill-conceived 5 week summer class with a maximum of 2 overall assignments,  I might find myself facing that again.  Essentially right now, I'm not talking to anybody except my parents, and that's just because they live with me.  Otherwise...let me sort this out.

      So, today was a pretty busy day at work, being the Labor Day weekend and all.  I didn't think I'd get off early.  Heck, why would I?  I don't on a regular weekend, much less a holiday one.  So they let me off around 15 minutes early--so I missed Sherry, who was going to leave my sunglasses and a little romantic notion of a flower on my car.  Le sigh. Cruel, fickle fate.

      "There is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which through' the poem, or through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses. "--E.A. Poe, from "The Poetic Principle"  Wow, Poe said that in a not so morbid tone of voice. Yay.  But it's true--every word of it.

      Argh! It was six bazillion degrees today, my shirt at work was almost soaked through with sweat.  And now I have to come home and mow the yard!  But I'm so not spring time fresh right now that I could probably roll around in the grass and kill the whole frickin' yard.  I would be afraid to go to the field behind my house for fear that my neighbors cows will start licking me because they've mistaken me for a salt lick.   Argh.  I want to be COLD.

      SURPRISE!  Dad brought his laptop from work on our trip toss some mapping software on in case we got uberlost.  But the trip is going okay so far, so that's a good thing.  We've had some scares, and it's rained almost every day.  But we have some pictures of stuff too, which is a good thing.  And yes, my hotmail addy had 60 messages in my junk AND inbox folders, but almost none of them were from actual people I know! I'm shocked!  Come on, people! Show me the love! (Unless there isn't any...which is something we need to talk about whenever I get back, apparently.)  But yeah, it hurt not seeing any messages or anything. That does NOT mean to flood my e-mail box with random crap.  Ah well, I probably won't get on the 'net again until I'm home, which I hope to be Friday/Saturday.  Just letting everyone know that I'm alive.  P.S. We are presently in Southington, Conn.

      Well,  urlLink Andrea  has managed to put together a list of the type of scum and villainy she's looking for in her quest to be Matriarch of the Pirates.  Of course, I'm stuck doing the menial work.  Heck, I'll probably even be the poor cabin boy that gets it from the first cannon fired, then the captain or whoever sobs over my shattered body whilst I speak, "I's ne'er got a chance to LIVE, cap'n!"   Or the sad fact is that maybe she actually DOES want me to be a pirate.  Oh well. Ninjas are cooler anyway.

      Whoo, some changes around here.  I'm actually happy with school and *Gasp* some days I go to work, and now there's a link to my friend Eric's blog, too.  And in case he ever reads this, sorry I couldn't make it to your house on Labor Day, chief.

      So, I'll just go ahead and say it--I screwed up, and nobody is going to change my mind about that.  This happened Friday at work--definitely one of the more stress inducing days we have in the grocery business.  Fortunately, everything was going smoothly this day--we weren't too busy, had a good bit of help scheduled, everything was going well.    Then Katy came in.  Katy is a girl that I get along with pretty well at work--we both have a little bit of the same sense of humor, we both pretty much hate where we work, she's going out with a guy out there who is a buddy of mine (and his brother kicks, too).  Now I had heard the stories about how she was prone to have seizures of some type before, but since she had mainly worked nights, I'd never been there for them, or even knew what sort they were.  About 10 minutes after she clocked in, she showed me her hand, shaking like a leaf in the wind. A few more minutes went on, and it kept getting worse.  I went to talk to her boyfriend to tell him about it, and we both decided that if anything happened, I'd call him and/or the manager on duty first.    I would ask her every now and then if she was okay--she was able to tell customers how much they owed, but she couldn't seem to manage to get the words out when I would ask her something.  Her eyes began hazing over, and her lower jaw would jar slightly.    I'll probably not forget what happened next as long as I live.  The shaking intensified, and she started trying to say my name over and over.  I ran to the register behind her and grabbed the microphone and called her boyfriend to the front in a calm, rational voice.  At the same time my hand left the microphone's button, she threw herself backwards onto the floor with the force of a tornado.  It was like somebody had a string tied to her neck, and they had just yanked it.  Another thing I won't forget is the sound.  Her head ricocheted off of the polished ivory tiles with a slapping sound, where she continued to shake.    I had been a foot and a half from her when this happened.  I was moving towards her, but....but I wasn't fast enough, or strong enough to do anything about it.  The eyes of the people after that...they knew I had been there, and they thought I had done nothing.    Which makes it worse, because even though I tried, I really didn't do anything.

      If you ask anybody, they'll tell you that I don't like to blow my own horn.  But we've submitted basically 3 things in the fiction writing class I'm in right now, and every time, the teacher, while reading them aloud or to herself, has commented in some fashion or the other that my writer's voice is, and I quote, "Great".  There are some pretty darned good writers in that class too, so I'm taking it as a heck of a compliment.  But on a sad note, the teacher did NOT like the fact that I tried to write from the perspective of a woman in my latest story.  This I found intriguing--most fiction has to deal with this at some point in a writer's career, and if anything, I want to be challenged while I'm in this class.  So, I'm not sure how to take it.  But I'm at least confident in my skills, something I've always had a problem saying before.   Maybe it's a sign of things to come.  P.S. Sherry and I are going to catch a flick tomorrow night, but danged if I know what we want to see. Not much on, honestly.

      So Sherry was running around town today and left a couple of gifts on my car--2 blue carnations, a card, and my sunglasses. Only they weren't mine--she'd gotten the cases screwed up and given me HERS.    Problem is that I really like them.  So I'll probably get my own pair.   But I still want MINE back, dangit.

      School's hitting pretty hard lately.  Got a test tomorrow and I've had to read 4 stories for my fiction writing class.  So far, with the exception of one story with a neat twist, the writing is sub-par and uninspired. I hope somebody else isn't writing this same thing on a blog of their own.  But they shouldn't be, heh.

      Well, Sherry and I went out for the first time in at least a week today, because I've been recovering from a dastardly cold(which is still hanging on, by the way).  While I was in town for a doctor's appointment, we ran over to Red Lobster to grab a bite to eat.  Of course, service was slow, and she ended up taking almost a 2 hour lunch break, but it was enjoyable.  Those damned biscuit things they have are dangerously close to ambrosia.   You take those for a meal, then eat the angel biscuits they've got at Bolton's Landing, and you've got a meal of bread.  Jesus couldn't make a better meal than that, especially if it was unleavened.  Man, somebody needs to introduce the Lord and Savior to things like yeast, cheese, and salt.  Also I'd like to know who his personal trainer was, because in all European depictions of him, Jesus is cut like fucking Mister Universe.

      Well, this is strange.  So far everybody I've talked to today that has actually celebrated the holiday of Thanksgiving has had a craptastic day.  Parents getting in their face, sibling rivalries, heck, somebody I probably haven't even talked to yet is sicker than a mental picture of Rod Stewart getting it on with your mom.  (From the eating, not the mental picture.)  But my day has been okay.  Woke up, ate a little breakfast, gamed all freaking day, ate the traditional dinner, watched a DVD with dad and well, now I'm here.  I had a pretty good day.  So who pissed in everybody else's Cheerios?

      An older male customer at work said that men grow beards for two reasons: 1. They're not getting enough sleep, or 2. They're protesting something.  It occurred to me, having the current facial hair (if it can be called that) that I might be protesting something.  This isn't some external source like protesting Vietnam or legalizing pot, but maybe I'm just protesting something against myself.  I've been on these kicks before, but this one's definitely hung around for much, much longer than the others.   So an internal struggle might be going on, so bear with me.  At least I hope that's what it is.

      Sometimes I lose faith.  Not in religion, because I already don't have faith in that particular society.  It doesn't hold anything for me except mysticism, wasted days and already cliched rules to live by.  No, sometimes I lose faith in something much more important to me than religion.  My ability to write.    They say in the Bible that Jacob wrestled with an angel, who finally yielded to him.  More often than not I feel mangled by the words I'm trying to control, surrounded by a gang of them that pummel me with sticks until everything shines away into ebony.    Today I went to one of those lovely required reading events at college, and saw people well nigh avoid me.  I was not welcomed.  I didn't fit in there.  I see people winning awards because they're part of some hidden community that I'm never going to be a part of.  Some of these "writers" have skill.  Others...do not.  I'm not bitter.  I just wish I belonged to the literary Illuminati around here.

      Scariest. Christmas. Ever.   Well, this is one for the ages.  Everyone in the house's blood pressure has been maxed out and down to weak, piddling levels all in the duration of one hour.  Around 8:30 we decided to go ahead and open our presents.  Good, great, fantastic.  We've been waiting all year, right? Well, something like that.  We rip paper, open our respective gifts, say our customary words of thanks whlle unanimously agreeing that we all spent too much on each other, and otherwise be a family during X-mas time.  I'd already picked up a portable CD/mp3/Atrac3 player, lounging pants, some nice shirts, a book, and numerous other things, so I was quite happy.  I'd just finished busting open a beautiful picture for my room  (Hey, I need some better scenery than an old Kathy Ireland poster.) and suddenly, I notice my parents are looking at each other, since this was supposedly my last gift.  "Where is it?"  "I don't know, I thought you put it up and wrapped it." "Uh....no."  Now I'll just skip the tension part of the blog and say that my folks had misplaced a 400 something dollar digital camera, which by itself was worth at least twice of everything I'd received so far.  For a good hour they looked around the house.  No luck. They thought that it had been left at Best Buy, or been stolen, or any other list of miscreant acts.  They kept thinking I was depressed that I wasn't getting this monstrous item--but it was the fact that they'd spent that much in the first place.  But the worst part was easily that it was facing the prospect that they'd spent that much time and money into finding it, and then having nothing to show for it.    Everybody in the house began to feel sick at their stomach.    I was sitting in the living room struggling with one of the packages I already had when mom said "Well, I'll go check under the bed."  It sounded absurd.  The irony of finding something like that under a bed when I'd been notoriously doing that for years would just be too much to handle.  But the words had a ring of truth in them.  Dad had already gone downstairs to sit in front of his computer and mope, mom was still halfheartedly poking around.  Well, she found it.  It was like finding a river in the middle of the desert.  Barriers fell down, smiles lit up faces, and sighs of relief passed through lips like wind through the trees.  Scariest. Christmas. Ever.

      Well, I have work tomorrow.  My fever is down from 102 to around 99, which is way way, WAY better as far as I'm concerned.  The major symptoms that seem to be left are just an overall lethargy, runny nose, and hacking cough. I really, really wish my lungs had some kind of DVD-ish "eject" button so I could just toss all of this crap out at once.  Sure, it'd look like a bloody ball of three quarters digested lipids, but hey, when you've gotta get it, you've gotta get it.  So I'm going to be at 8:30 like a good little geriatric so I can hopefully roll into he--er, work tomorrow.

      8 hours get pretty boring when you can't sleep.  There's only so many things you can do.    Well, when I went to bed last night I was having hot flashes (Yeeeaaah! No, you sick freak.) chills, aches in my joints/general soreness, and running a fever of 101.  This morning, add a headache to that, take away the hot flashes chills and aching, and keep the temperature at the same level, and that's where I'm at.  So I'm going to go upstairs and watch TV with my mom all friggin' day.  Oh well.

      So, according to Andy Serkis, the actor that portrayed Gollum in all of the latest LotR movies, there's actually a GOLLUM PORN site out there on the 'net somewhere. Am I surprised? No.  Do I want to see it? No.  Do I want the hits from people actually looking for it?  Well, there'll be quite a bit of them, that's for sure.   And um, the Ring could be a pretty nasty sex toy, if you want to get down into it.    Hey, I'm just saying. Don't look at me like that, geez.  Pissant.

      Well, work's sucked a big honky lately.    We've had a startling lack of management for a mid-major level grocery store.  Quite sad, really.  Basically kids showing up and clocking in, talking with a little work mixed in for around 5-6 hours, then getting sent home.    And on an even sadder note, Mike died.    I know, nobody knows who Mike is.  I'm sure they're wondering why they should even care about Mike. Well, if you've ever wondered why martyrs do what martyrs are usually known for, it should make an interesting story. Mike was a bagger at the store.  He was at least 70 years old.   I  come home tired after a day of work, I can only imagine what he felt like.  A couple of years ago, his body basically gave out on him a day at work.  I'm not sure, but I think it was a heart attack, or something similar.  I wasn't there, but I knew the ambulance had to come pick him up.  Mike took off close to a year, maybe more, trying to rest up so he could come back.  Why, after having a serious health problem would he possibly want to come back to a physically demanding job?  He wanted to earn the money to pay for his wife's cancer treatments, because the disease was slowly eating away at her.  Eventually Mike came back to work, but nothing was the same.  He would work 3, maybe 4 hours a day, and he was obviously slowed down compared to even his old level of work.  Unfortunately, he knew this, and pretty much quit one day after realizing he couldn't do it.  And now, as far as I know, he's preceded his wife in death.  I'm not saying what he did was the right thing, or even if there is a right and wrong side to this story.    But it   did   happen.

       I Am A:  Lawful Evil Human Fighter Ranger    Alignment:   Lawful Evil  characters believe that a nice, orderly system of life is perfect for them to abuse for their own advancement. They will work within 'the system' to get the best that they can for themselves.    Race:   Humans  are the 'average' race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live 'for the moment'.    Primary Class:   Fighters  are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.    Secondary Class:   Rangers  are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.    Deity:   Iyachtu Xvim  is the Lawful Evil god of fear, hatred, malice, and tyranny. He is also known as the Godson and the Son of Bane. He appears as a gaunt, naked, scimitar-wielding man, or as a black cloud with glowing green eyes. His followers are working to strengthen his position in the world by converting (often by force) other deities' worshippers. They wear black robes with dark green trim, and wear black iron gauntlets with green eyes on the backs. Iyachtu Xvim's symbol is a black hand, inset with green eyes.

      Phew.  Well, some wild things have been happening that I needed to write about and uh, forgot. Sorry about that.  Have some soup.  First things first. Last Friday was easily the strangest day of my working experience.  First off, it's Friday.  This is usually a very, very busy day, what with people getting ready for...ah, whatever they do with lots of food on weekends, I don't know, because I'm WORKING. HAH HA! Take that, Errol Flynn.  Anyway, we're insanely slow this day, but not slow enough to send people home.  So Connie, the matronly cashier on the front end and I are going through an order with an older woman and her daughter.  Her younger, chubby daughter. Actually, that bulge doesn't look very much like fat.   Oh, Jesus, it's a pregnant woman, and she's saying her contractions are 5 minutes apart.    %(#$!!   What do you mean %(#$?   She's going to have her %(#$ing baby right here!  Ah, &@#!.  Needless to say, she actually didn't pop there in the store, but asked me nicely if I'd take them out to the car and put them in for her.      %#*$ yes I will! Move, woman!  Hyah! Hyah!  I took the woman's cart and her mother took her own cart out, and of course, I finished first.      By the time I get this done she'll have had the baby!   &$(%*!!!  But she finished and they took off.  Now I just hope they don't do something stupid like giving the kid my name just because they saw it on my nametag, yeesh.  The weekend went pretty much as planned, as business picked up for the Super Bowl.  We had a kid come in Sunday to get some snacks and stuff for a party he was having.  Of course, he was on the schedule to work about 2 hours later than when he was actually in the store, only he didn't know it, because the kid that had switched with him uh, forgot to TELL him.  So I got to hang around until the closing bagger (Usually plural) showed up, wished him luck, and went on home.  Not sure how that one's going to turn out, but they're not happy with them, that's for sure.  And for school, well, that's just weird.  We were supposed to have a test today, and it got canned because of the bad wintery weather death and destruction we had today, so I just didn't go to school at all.    And we were supposed to have read the first 25 chapters of Genesis for my World Lit class.  Whoa, easy there, teacher, nothing too exciting now.  If I read too much of it, I'll be begetting myself some unintentional naps.  Whoops.  And there's your HUGE FRICKIN' UPDATE, WHOO.

      While at the grocery today, mom was shopping around a little bit to cater for the needs of a couple of relatives (okay, a cousin of mine and his wife).  So she's trying to think if we have anything for them to drink back at the house.  Her brow purses as she thinks.  "Mountain Dew." I reply, "Mountain Dew?" "Didn't they like that the last time they were at our house?" "I think so." Mom frowned.  "If it isn't what they like, will you drink it?" My eyes widened a bit, and I paused. "Well, yeah." A small look of relief blew across her face like a swift breeze.  "Oh, good."  Can she really not remember what I like to drink?  Is it that hard?

I'd like to be able to tell my younger self that some of the most anticipated things you wait for in life aren't all they're cracked up to be, at least not in the way you usually imagine them. I'd like to be able to tell my younger self that he has a bright, glowing future just down the road a piece.

      There's just been so much death lately, it makes you...  No, we won't go into that stereotypical land of wondering about your own faith or morality or whatever words you find for it.    Car accidents happen, people die, and people get hurt.  The old pass away after their allotted time.  Of course, believing in how much time you have is a set amount makes you believe in fate, in which case you shouldn't be shocked by any of this.  Because hasn't your idea of fate decreed that these days would come? That you would be here to see them? How can fate exist if you have the free will to believe that this was an accident?

      So I find myself going out with "the guys" for the first time in a good little while tonight.  It should be interesting, we're going to go see a movie when Billy gets off from work, and I'm meeting Johnboy a little early to just hang out and shoot the crap for a while.    While on the phone with John, we talked a little bit about how we'd just end up raising several levels of hell while going around town.  We talked about going to K-Mart and hitting the little customer service button things and running off. "Customer assitance in feminine accessories. Customer assistance in feminine accessories."  Then I told him something I'd done in the past about running around with some tampons and looking as confused as possible in the process.   "Yeah, I was wondering, do you guys have low carb tampons? The missus sure could use some of those if you know what I'm saying."  We both laughed.  We probably shouldn't have, but we did.

      The Dreamless  Envy them that do not trip over their own dreaming feet and fall in the mental mud, slowly drowning in their own well-lit dreams, charged with a changing fate you can't ever finish.

      Oh, holy crap on a stick.  I'm worn out to a frazzle in a cotton shirt that's been washed too many times.  I just finished the summer class that's been killing me for the past 3 weeks, so now I get a normal week....maybe.   Exhaustion, damned be your name.

      There's something about seeing a mostly empty parking lot at the high school you went to.  It's empty because of graduation, of course, another class of 18 year olds sent out into the open air like termites to chomp at the wood of the world.  I wish I could tell them so much, but even I can't put everything into words.  I want to hug them, slap them, beat them with a large hunk of wood, give them meaningful advice, tell them there is a God and yes he does love you, I want to kiss them on their foreheads in a solemn benediction and tell them that yes, as human beings, you are going to fail.

      Whoops.  I guess I forgot to update.  My bad.  Deal with it, by the way.   Finals happened. Think I did okay on most of them.    .....that's about it.  Kbye.

      Well, I won't go into all of the gritty details (mostly because I can't remember all of the places we went) but the family vacation was interesting, if nothing else.  No major blowups in the car or anything. Got to see Vegas again, then we went north and looked at a whole bunch of parks in Utah and Colorado and the like, saw the other side of the Grand Canyon, had the parents freak out because of a narrow walkway that would have surely plummeted them into a cavernous rock surface that would cause their primitive skull casings to spray jelly everywhere upon impact but hey, that's life, eh?  Good times, good times.

      To feel your hair. Only it wouldn't be as simple as that, no. It would not be so much the feeling of the hair that would remind me of you as it would that it remains that it's me, right here, right now, holding your hair in my calloused and rough hands.  To see you smile. Lips curl on a shaky highway, making your stomach do topsy-turvy twirls every time you run across one  of those types of curves.  You know the type.   These curves remind you of home, somewhere.  To dream with you. Because in the waking world we only have each other, but if we were asleep we'd be together in ways  humanity can't possibly imagine.  Life would be too great for them to handle, and people would be clenching their fists in  agony that they couldn't sleep, to dream.   And you and I would wake, smile at each other (the topsy turvy curves) and I would touch your hair with my rough and calloused hands (right here right now) And we would dream the dream again.

      This is just a short little reminder to people that I'm taking a family vacation for a little while.  So if you slowly realize that I'm not around and wonder if I'm dead or not, now you know why.  So I'll come back with stories and....well, probably not much else.  Maybe my clothes. Anyway, bye for a while.

      UBERw00t!  I got an A in that class I was taking this summer.  It was the sleepwise equivalent of cutting your own kidneys out with a dull screw head, but by God, it was worth it if I did that well.

      Breaking my back, just to know your name seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game. I'm breaking my back just to know your name, but heaven ain't close in a place like this.--"Somebody Told Me" The Killers  This song freaking rocks.  It's like uberrockdisco, sort of like Electric Six, but peppier.
