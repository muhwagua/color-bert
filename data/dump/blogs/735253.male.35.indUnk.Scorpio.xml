      Had a bad dream last night - need to process.  Mostly it was Cyn and I screaming at each other, mostly about money.  things are so tight right now I feel like screaming for real.  In the dream Cyn was telling me that we neede to just go get a personal accountant to take care of things, I was telling her we couldn't afford it.  Then she 'reminded' me that I was getting closer to 40, when I needed to have a job where I could stay home with the kids all day.  I lost it.  I tried telling her that I needed to see someone with that kind of job arrangement so I could emulate it - I was willing if I could just see it.  I would do whatever, but I was trying to get across to her that she had unrealistic expectations.  Of course, all the while, yelling at the top of my lungs.  While I was "explaining" my position, she just turned and walked away.  It didn;t help, that the first thing she asked me after we were both up was "So can I still not go shopping for School supplies today?"  I didn't yell, but I have been a bit cranky this morning.  The dream really hits on my feeling inadequate - esp. when supporting my family.  I work hard at a job I enjoy, but I just don't make enough money.  We could LIVE on what I make, but not where we are now.  We would have to discharge all of our debts except the house in order to make it.  Cyn probably won't be able to work much longer, and then it'll all be on me.    No pressure, or anything.

      Feeling a real need to write tonight, but I don't know about what.  Cyn is on the phone with her mom, having a hard time, and doesn't want me near.  She. . . I dunno, she something.  Been talking w/Loki (who is going through shit) and Ti (who seems to be ok) and biding my time,  waiting to be needed - no, WANTING to be needed, but Cyn is in this superwoman mode, wanting to 'take care of her own needs' like a marriage isn't a partnership.  I understand wanting to be strong, but she won't ever be, not as sick as she is.  Then again,I can't do her life for her. She has to go to work, has to do church, thinks she has to put on for the world.  I could help more, I guess, but then I don't have time to read, time to write, then I go slowly mad and curl up in my comfy little shell and start dying again.  Wow, that sounds so cheery!  Of course, most of my thoughts these days ARE doom and gloom, waiting to screw up for the last time, waiting to be asked to leave, wi\aiting for Cy to do something drastic.  I'm hoping she won't, but I get afraid she may-being in as much pain, and as much pain, as she is.  I worry.  I'm good at it.

      A long time ago Cyn asked me what sign I was.  I told her: "Scorpio." "Aha" she said. "What does that mean?" "What? Aha, or that you're a Scorpio?" "Both" "'Aha' means that I wasn't sure.  That you're a Scorpio is interesting." "How so?" "Well, from a Scorpio's point of view, there are three important things: Sex, Death and religion, and not necessarily in that order." I thought for a moment and let it sink in. "Well, what else is there?" She laughed for a long time.   To this day, I don't now why.

      Wimped out today.  Mom called to wish Bronwyn a happy birthday,and I didn't tell her to fuck off.  I  FELT  like it, but I didn't.  I did tell her that the prosecutor had denied my case, so once again the bastards get away with it.  But, I told her I expect her to keep a close eye on the kids.  Maybe it's better this way, rather than just cutting her off.  Cyn still thinks I'm mad (or should be) at her.  What makes me mad is her trying to decide what my emotions are, and telling me I'm not facing things if I don't appear to agree.  So, do I continue to communicate MY thoughts, or do I go back to letting her put emotions in my head?  I think I need to write more.  My days don't seem as foggy as they have this past week.

      Thought for the day *****************  From  'Wild At Heart by John Eldridge   Now you must understand: Forgiveness is a choice.  It is not a feeling, but an act of the will.  As Neil Anderson has written, "Don't wait  to forgive until you feel like forgiving; you will never get there.  Feelings take time to heal after the choice to forgive is made."  We allow God to bring the hurt up from our past, for "if your forgiveness doesn't visit the emotional core of your life, it will be incomplete."  We acknowledge that it hurt, that it mattered, and we choose to extend forgiveness (to the one who hurt us).  This is  not  saying, "I probably deserved part of it anyway."  Forgiveness says, "It was wrong, it mattered, and I release you."  ************************** Ok, I get it.  ouch.

      All right, I know why I was so crabby today.  Well, partly.  The heat today was fierce, it's still over 100 at almost 11pm, but that only exacerbated the crankiness.  The little detour on the way home from Betsy and Andy's may have been a bit out of the way, but it was right on the map. ; )

      ******in the morning, after some sleep (shut up, loki!)*********  Feeling a bit displaced today.  I wanted to build a case for our massive cd collection, but the first thing C says is, "If it's ugly can I say no?"  What the hell am I supposed to say?  "No, you can't refuse.  I'm building this damn thing to correct an organization problem, and I want to do it.  If you hate it, tough shit, it's my house, too."  I feel no sense of ownership, no power to make decisions around here.  Then she wants to know why I don't ever decorate, or unpack, or do serious cleaning.  arrrg.  I just wish she'd trust me to do something that won't suck.  Now I don't even feel like doing it at all.  The cd cases we have are not very well organized, she wants to put them on the wall.  When I start to discuss the merits of a tower case (that's mobile) versus screwing things into the wall, she tells me she has a headache and really can't concentrate on planning.  I'm sure she does have a headache, leftovers from thursday's migrane, but I always seem to pick migrane days to try to discuss things like this. I wonder what would happen if I just said what the hell and did it? Without permission? Ooh, the shivers!  The real hell of it is, I was nervous before I approached the topic, wanting to do it so she'd agree with me.  Maybe I need to learn to compromise. . .  but damnit, I want to be right, completely right, just once!

      ...and speaking of pissing off parents, (or getting pissed on by said)  I got a *wonderful* email from Dad today.  (feel the sarcasm? Hmm?)  He sends me this pious little poem, supposedly written in first person, about a little girl that is being abused, thinking she was bad and deserves it.  I'm sure the person who penned it has never even been within striking distance of that kind of abuse - I know I would gouge out my fingers before I ever wrote something so sappy and trite about my experiences.  I didn't feel her 'pain', I felt like retching.  I wonder if I should tell Dad what happened to me when he decided it would "be easier for everyone" (his words) if he just left.  He was a Marine, I wonder if he can "handle the truth"?  Hmmm . . .  No wonder my life is so screwed.

      I just re-read my previous entry.  Why do I let my mouth (in this case fingers) go so off?  I wish I could express my frustration without resorting to profanity, but sometimes it is the only thing that fits.  But if I say 'fuck' to mom, she'll probably have a heart attack.  Lord, forgive the way I vent my frustration.  I know feeling frustrated is not wrong, but what I do with it demonstrates my current relationship with You.  Right now, I feel like everyone around is having dinner with You, and I'm the mutt under the table sniffing for crumbs.  Forgive my unbelief - not believing that You DO have a purpose for all this, not wanting to get far enough out of my own head to see what that might be.  I know you didn't make it happen, my abuse was the result of someone elses' sinful actions, but I am still stuck with the pain.  Is it wrong to wish some Earthly consequenses onthem?  Kind of a taste of the eternal ones waiting?  Forgive my uncharity, at this point I'll be really upset if I see them in Heaven.  Turn this wicked crap (I have no other word for it) into fertilizer.  Grow . . . Ahh, I don't know.  Grow something so beautiful that people won't believe what kind of shit it's grown in.  Thakn You that I can be honest with You - bone-baring, gut-wrenching honest.  If my language offends, I'm sorry.  Help me to develop a new grammer to fit the new creation You're making with me.

      I saw a bumper sticker that offended me today.  It said "If it ain't King James, It ain't a BIBLE!"  I just have to wonder what these kind of people think when the either slap this sticker on their truck (yes, it was a truck) or even THINK to produce such a thing.  After all, do they really believe that God speaks King James English?  Well, if you read certain famous fiction writers in the Christian world, it must be so.  Not only God, but any Prophet so annointed, even!  When I get to Heaven, will God look at me and say, "Well Done, thou good and faithful servant"?  Naw, I rather think He'll say something like, "Hey guy, ya done good.  Have a seat."  To a good ole southern boy He might say "Y'all come on ovah heah and set you down a spell.  Been workin' a mite hard ain't ya?".  To the Bud guys, He'll just scream "WAZZUUUUP!"  After all, there ARE other translations of the Bible, Earlier ones, better ones.  Tyndale was jailed (and killed) for his work 80n years before ol King Jimmy decided he wanted to put his name on something for posterity.  And Tyndale's labor was for love of the scripture, not for fame.  Fr. Valera translated from greek into Spanish even before Tyndale did English!  Why does 1611 remain the acme of Bible translation? *I* don't speak KJ, and when anyone comes at me talking like Shakespere in church, I start looking for the hand riffling through my wallet.  I just can't seem to trust someone who will put their whole doctrinal focus on when a Bible was translated.  It is a slap in the face to all of the scholarship and hard work that has been done in the last 400+ years.  Then again, according to the Mormons, I don't even have all of the scripture!  Guess I need some of them golden goggles or something.  All of this cynicism makes me wonder about myself a bit.  What do I expect to gain from it?  I bitch and moan and whine and complain, all the time with a sardonic grin that never quite stops frowning (according to Cyn - I think she may be right) and all I seem to accomplish is dragging those within my realm of influence into the muck with me.  One look into my eyes shows nothing revealing, then look again and in all of that nothing hides (not really) my own fear of being a bigot.  *left turn* I can't stop being pissed at Mom.  I WANT to (so I tell myself), I want to do the right thing, the christian thing, the thing Christ himself would do.  But then, Christ himself condemmed those who would harm children.  does that extend to not actually harming, but allowing harm to come to and not doing SHIT about it?  Damn, I'm getting riled again.  I hate when I get this way, I just seem to go round and round and go no-fucking-where.  They got away with it.  Pure and simple.  Out there, walking free, are three cold hearted bastards who fucked me over.  And what can I do about it?  short of a killing, nothing.  I reported it to the police - got zilch.  OK that's not exactly true. But what I did get won't keep those predators away from any kids.  I tortured myself for months (still am) and their consciences seem to rest easy.  So what do i do?  Press on, I guess.  What do I do with Mom?  I can't ignore her anymore.  If I do, it'll have to be an actice ignore - send the presents back.  I told her I'd do it, but I don't know if I have the guts to stick to it.  There it is.  No guts.  I guess they got fucked out of me a long, long time ago.

      I've run across this quote three times in different places in the past two days.  I wonder at the significance . . . ************** It is not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.  The credit belongs to the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly . . . who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails at least fails greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who have never known neither victory nor defeat.                                          Teddy Rosevelt *************** Gotta ponder that . . .

      Cyn asked me what the next step is.  It kinda threw me, I thought we were still exploring the first one!  I told her I wanted to start dating again, but it's difficult to plan anything when I have no control over the budget.  We may (budget allowing) have worked out a solution to that, and rather painlessly, too.  She liked the idea, I haven't told her it was the ONLY thing I could find the remotest bit positive about separating.  I still think the whole idea sucks, but we seem to be putting it on a very back burner.  I just want to push it off the stove alltogether.  We seem to be heading toward the path to healing.  What worries me is that whenever we seem to be on the right road, something sideswipes us right back off of it.  I'm beginning to think that a successful relationship is not one that stays on the right path, but one that can traipse all over the universe, and never lose track of where it's towel is.  Or something like that.  I haven't written much, nor have I let her read this journal.  It seems strange that anyone in the world can read these words, but the person I am closest to doesn't know where to find them.  Then again, She knows where my paper journal is, but won't read that.  I guess it's the same thing.  I'm not likely to put anything REALLY incriminating in either.  I operate my private life like a spy, nothing in writing, destroy any evidence.  It's a little hard to destroy my brain, though.

      I should go to sleep, but I can't, and I don't want to.  Been chatting w/ Loki and Mark, both at different phases of the same conversation.  What happened, where did it go wrong, how to fix things.  I pray every day things will get better, and if I could WILL them better, they would be.  I have that much will.  But do I have the will to act?  Hmmm. .. seems to be the crux of the problems.  Loki suggests I write to Cyn.  I think it's a good idea.  I found something I wrote 10 years ago, I think it's what I want.  A wise one once told me:  "If it's just bodies, it's Not making love. It's having sex. If it's just minds, it's Friendship. If just souls, A connection.  Until you merge all three my child, You're just going through the motions.   THAT's what I want again.  So how do I connect with someone who feels they've betrayed all of that?  . . .  I'm going to bed. . .

      Well, didn't run, but got posted.  I'm telling Mark about the troubles w/Cyn.  I guess he might know how it feels to be asked to split, but then again, I'm not going anywhere.  Ok. The real reason I hate journaling is that you can't bullshit yourself.  We'll see how this goes. . .  I guess eventually I'll get over the idea that I need to write for someONE, rather than just to write.  I've never done that before.  I mean, *I* have my thoughts, why should I write them down?  they're in my head, after all!  'Objection!  Your Honor, the Counsel for the Defence is stalling, attempting to enter side tracks to avoid the truth!"  Yeah, whatever.  Speaking of sidetracking, I just found my poetry journal.  Man was I strange.  Reading these, I realize how hard I tried to be ANYthing but me.  'Though this one is cool:  Upon my teeth and tongue words slip and bubble whirling Around until they meet with a thought and Become  Meaning.  I guess I'm trying to say that I babble a lot.  Yeah, anything to avoid getting to the heart of a matter.

      Well, I want to write more, but Cyn will be home soon, and I need to get the kids put to bed.  Maybe I'll get back tomorrow, if I have the time.  I'll have to go to work sometime and make up Drill time, (sometimes the Army is a drag)  But maybe I'll just let it go.  I gotta run tonight, too.  Can't fail the PT test.

      I can't decide if I really need to write every day, or not.  Sometimes there's not much that seems like needs to be said, sometimes there's so much it clogs up and won't come out.  Right now I'm just so busy and tired that I can't seem to want to spare the time at the end of the day.  The stress is easing a bit, but I think I've just decided to keep my head down and barrell through.  It's safer that way, and we'll get through.  I'd rather live, though.

      I wish I knew why I am so on edge.  I feel just about ready to snap, and God help the individual(s) who are in the blast radius whe that happens.  It's not like I've had a stressful time lately or anything.  After all, it's quite normal to wrench your marriage back from the abyss, have your daughter butten in the face by a dog, get sued (twice), lose a raise,  and have your not-quite-sufficient income cut by a third.  And in less than two months!  I really have no reason to be bitter.  None at all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Quitchabitchin.  I'd like to have a good reason to completely trash someone, like I did before I went to OBI.  My internal rage is about at the same level, just for different reasons.  And while I would love to do that, the repercussions are much, much greater.  You're not a Juvvie anymore, Sparky.  So, I have to find out how to get a hold on the reins and stop this rampaging fury before it gets loose.  I could really hurt somebody.  Oh, that it would be someone who deserves a real ass-kicking!  It's getting more and more difficult to just take a deep breath.   Lately I feel like all I'm doing is deep-breathing exercises, like some sort of anger-management Lamaize technique.  fuck it.  I'm too scattered to write tonight.

      Worship is a relationship.  I have come to suppose it's like being a kid, and telling your parents how great they are by showing them how much and how often you want to be with them.  I have this image of Koshka when she was about 14 months old.  I'm in the living room, trying to get a fire going.  I have the baby gate up so she won't get in.  I don't want her in the ashes, making a mess (again), and I REALLY don't want her near the almost non-existant fire I'm building - or so I think.  Koshka is pulling on the gate, rattling it in its frame, and whining.  I'm getting so frustrated, both at the stupid fire, because it's cold (and, truth be told, the firemaker.  I was a boyscout, for goodness sakes!)  and at the constant rattle & whine.  So, compassionate man that I am, I turn to my precious baby child, the delight of my life, and I say sweetly (and at the top of my voice) "What do you WANT?!?!?"  She stops rattling, stops whining, raises her hands and says, "I want you.  I want a hug."  I'm tired of 'intelligent' worship.  Tired of not being able to experience the emotion of God's presence.  I want to sing, weeping to God.  I want to be able to lift my hands, and not be aware of what is happening.  I want the Holy Spirit to take control of my worship, leaving 'me' (or, rather, my self-consciousness) out completely.  But I think I may have ruined that for myself.  I so distrust emotionally based decision making that I've tried not to be influenced at all in that way.  Coming from a dually emotionally based spirituality (in one service, "Do you  FEEL  the Saviour tugging on your heart?", in the next, "That is my Testimony, because I  FEEL  it to be true.") I despise(d) the 'stirrings of my heart'.  I learned not to trust my emotions in other areas, it was only a matter of time before my spiritual life suffered the same hit.  Opening up to emotion opens me up to pain.  I've had enough of that.  Also, I don't trust what I feel as much as what I can reason.  I don't have to feel God is there, I can, by reading the Bible, know intelectually that He exists.  Some people reject that argument, but it is enough for me.  i have no problem with reasoning out the exegetical topics in Scripture, digging into a passage, arguing an interpretation.  In a Bible study, if someone says "I feel . . ." I usually say, "I don't.  Prove it."  I get such satisfaction from really tearing apart a piece of text - what does it mean? What is the writer saying? what is the historical significance? How does it apply today? I don't want to emotionalize my Bible study, I like it just the way it is.  But Worship!  Getting together with a bunch of people who believe - or don't - with the sole purpose of praising God - like paying proper homage to a king, to   the   King.  Or being by myself, so in the moment with God that He speaks!  To me! I love listening to music, it gets me there so much faster than anything, but it seems that right before I break that barrier where I'm in the real, palpable presence of the Almighty God, something interferes.  I can rebuke it all that I want, but all that does is draw attention to the fact that I'm no longer giving all of myself to honoring God.  there's that little piece that refuses to give over.  it's the one that - seemingly benign - wants to analyze the lyrics for doctrinal compliance.  Or starts listening (appreciatively, of course) to the harmonies rather than unselfishly adding to them.  Every time I get the urge to raise my hands, I suffer from the most frustrating catch 22.  If I  don't , I have to concentrate on quenchng the feeling, the desire, the longing of my hande to lift of their own accord.  If I  do , I wonder who's looking at me, if they're thinking I'm putting on spiritual airs (which is what  I  cynically tend to think).  This happens whether or not anyone else is raising hands, or dancing, or crying, or being the least bit expressive.  My worship is repressive.  I don't try to repress anyone else, at least I hope not, but I do a heck of a lot of repressing of myself.  It helps that I play the drums in church - my hands are busy, I have an excuse.  It would be very difficult for me to raise my hande between paradiddle flams! Well, maybe not flams, if I was creative enough! :)   But now I have the opportunity to lead the worship team again.  If I do so, I want to lead, to lead the entire congregation right into God's living room, into His kitchen, to use His bathroom, and to know where the family towels are, that it's ok to use them.  But to do that, I have to know the way there, I have to be a frequent enough guest, that I feel at home, ready to kick my shoes off and scratch my toes,as it were.  I know the way, but there seems to be a barrier right at the doorway.  God's inviting me in, I can see the coffee and muffins on the table, the sofa looks just perfect for leaning against, but I can't get through.  I know the way, but I'm not comfortable there.  The hell of it is, it's a barrier of my own making.  I even  put it there.  I devised my own 'Don-gate' to keep me from where I don't belong.  Where I could get hurt.  "Is He safe?"  "Safe?  Oh no, He's not safe.  But He's good."  Dear God, sometimes finding you is like trying to smell the colour 9.  Expand my senses to make it possible.  I can't get this darned gate out of the way.  Take it down, I want a hug.

      I have to wonder what happens when I decide to do something to improve my life.  I'm really trying to 'bounce' my eyes from things I shouldn't dwell on, but when I make an effort to do so, there seems to be so much for them to stick to!  Is it because I'm just more sensitive to inappropriate thoughts and actions, or am I under attack?  Like yesterday.  I left the house, pledging to 'not look lustfully on a maiden' (Job 31:1), and no sooner than I get to the end of my street than I see this hottie I've never noticed before jogging, wearing a bit of spandex and little else.  I try not to break my neck 'not looking'.  I go the grocery store to get something for lunch, and it's like the inside of my wildest dreams/nightmares.  The cute stocker is wearing stretchy, low slung, beyond hip-hugger slacks, and when she stoops to refill a bottom shelf  right in front of me  I am immediately aware of the shock I could deliver by telling her how much I appreciate/wish I hadn't seen the obvoiusly see-thru white thong with little kiss prints on it.  That was visible to below the spot where it dissappeared into her cheekal division.  And that I like the rose tat that the thong is supposed to cover. arrg.  I look (of course) until I realize that I'm almost drooling, tear my eyes away and turn the isle corner.  Quickly.  It's not the isle I need, but it's an escape.  As I walk down, I get halfway and notice the woman heading toward me looks like she's wearing shorts-pajamas.  Without underwear.  Oh yes, the fact that her cuffs and collar don't match becomes  very  evident as I get closer.  Then, (don't ask me how the physics apply to this, I still can't figure it out!) as she reaches for something on the shelf, she completely pulls open her top, revealing her unfettered mammarial excess.  And I mean excess.  AND, she is unaware of the visible facts at least until I am past her.  Which I would like to say I did as quickly as I could, but alas, I did not.  I don't think she was even aware I was there.  So I grab my food, not even realizing until later that I get a flavor of yogurt that I don't particularly care for.  I head for the check out, and there again, I think it must be Stripper Day at Winco.  Short lepard spot skirt, tight, low cut crop top (which barely holds back the raging abundance), and as she bends over to empty her cart, I think "Hey, I've never seen fuzzy panties before.  Oh."  Yeah, there may be fuzzy panties, but I bet they don't come with clit rings.  All of this before 9:00 am.  Then I get to work.  It is Hottie day at the bookstore.  On my first forray out of the backroom I spot another hip-hugger thong show.  On my second, there is the firm bralessness of a tank top (walking into an air conditioned store) over sweat pants snugged down to the point that I can read the tag on her peach panties.  Yup, Victoria, I know your secret.  The third time, I get to see just exactly how well built both of the college girls who work in the store are, both within seconds.  I stayed in the back room the rest of the day.  I didn't want to put all of this in here to tittilate (interesting word) but to illustrate what happens when I try to take control of my mind.  Is there really that much temptation every day, and I am just blissfully unaware of it?  Or were the plethora of sightings deliberate attacks on my spiritual morality?  In either case, I think I'm better off if I don't try.

      Of course, I still have to write the letter.  I can start with Tom Fischell, write to him and send a sample of a letter to the churches.  At the same time, send letters to everyone, connected or not.

      Talked w/ Dr Watts yesterday.  We went in there to talk about US, and ended up talking about ME.  Since things with the uncles are at a legal end, he suggested I write a letter to Tom Fischell and explain that if he doesn't fire Jim, I will write to the convention, to churches, etc until he is no longer in a position to harm children.  I hate to even think about threatening something like that, but it seems all other avenues are closed.  So, it looks like I'm writing a letter tonight.  I think I'll write to all of them - the three, that is.  Tell them that I know what happened, I'm not crazy, people believe ME, and that they suck.  Then, I'll write to the prison that's holding Alan, to Bambi camp, and to whoever is stupid enough to give Robert a job.  I'll find places to post it on the web, and keep on doing it until I get a cease and desist order.  Then I'll keep doing it until they drag me into court.  That'll be the day!  "Uh, can you PROVE that they did these things to you?"  "That's not my job.  Can they PROVE that they DIDN'T?"  assholes.

      So when do I stop being afraid when things are going well?  I know, I bitch and moan about it a lot, but that;s when disaster seems to strike at our relationship.  Of course, right now disaster is striking the damn car.  Spent over a grand on it this summer to keep it running, this morning on my way to Caldwell and it over heats.  Again. The only part of the cooling system I HAVEN'T replaced is the heater core, and guess what blew this morning?  I'm going to have to keep it another five years just to make the repairs worth it.

      ok, so it's been a long damn time since I wrote.  I've been (insert your favorite excuse here, I'm tired of making 'em up!)  The poem just did something strange to my mind.  I went and visited the travelling Viet Nam Memorial Wall, and again, looking at all of those names, well, I just got a bit loopy.  AND the car saga is not done yet.  Blew the f***** heater core two weeks ago, C and I have been carpooling - THAT's an excercise in hell scheduling!  One more damn payment.  So do I make the payment and own a non-mobile hunk of shit, or do I skip yet another fiscal obligation and have a working vehicle?  Aah, the questions I never thought I'd have to ponder in Mama P's class!  AND I found out more about what Cyn did, and with whom.  Kinda rocked my world.  I thought it was a bit odd that she took so much responsibility for such a little thing, but then it wasn't very little.  It's been a long time since I wanted to beat the holy shit out of someone (pun may be intended), but now I have to struggle every day against the ever-present rage-ing fantasies.  Though, I still don't think I know it all, at least not the details. Don't know if I want to.  But it's getting harder and harder to just let things go than it used to.  AND the bull-shit excuse she gave me that it probably happened because she might still be pissed about something that happened two years ago.  I thought I held a grudge, but that is fucking ridiculous.  AND we left our church a few weeks ago. I hate, I mean really HATE that I had to do that.  Mad at Cyn, mad at Craig, mad at God.  I don't really think I was using the church as an idol or as an excuse not to stay on the path.  I believe I finally found a church where I could learn REAL things, and they had to go fuck it up. I thought my worship was repressive before, I've only been to 3 services out of the last 6, and didn't really give a rip one way or the other at any of them.  Skipped and slept in once, went hunting once . . . has it really been 6 weeks?  Man time flies.  I just checked the letter to Craig, but I didn't date it.  Guess I never thought I'd use it for posterity's sake.  All right, you're probably wondering what the hell I'm talking about.  Around the beginning of June Cyn told me she'd kissed some other man.  Wouldn't tell me who, or when.  Just said there was too much to lose.  So I went on all summer, feeling bad, trying to keep my wife from leaving me, trying to convince myself to keep fighting.  She wasn't leaving for the other guy, she was leaving because "she obviously wasn't meant to be married." (her words)  We worked on things all summer (read the previous whole journal), and got to a place where we were ready to move on, but her level of guilt made me question the sequence of events.  So, late one night, I pressed until I found out who, (actually, I guessed, and was right the first time) and what.  Only now I'm not sure I trust the what.  She glossed over a bit, now I wonder if there's more to that bit, or if I'm just being paranoid.  Guess I have a reason to be, though.  God my life sucks right now.  Wonder why I didn't want to write?  Some guy practically forces himself on my wife, she responds and they have a heavy petting/makeout session, and guess what?  The guy who wants to do my wife just happens to be her boss.  Oh, no, not the principal at the school, the other boss.  The boss of the Worship Leader job.  Who just happens to also be my pastor.  I can't write anymore now.

      Ya know, the more I find out, the more I don't want to know.  But then again, denial is a thing of the past - or so I'm hoping, so all I can do is find out everything.  I don't know if it would be better to get it all out up front, or continue to let it all just eke out piece by piece, and deal with each piece separately - but that seems to drag out the hurt, so I don't know.

      Bad dream last night.  I dreamed *I* was the one who was raped by Craig.  And as I was trying to tell about it, I was so afraid I was lying about everything.  I think I'm doubting my sanity

      Ya know, things only get more intense.  Between bouncing house payments, losing a job, and having dreams where I have fabulous sex with a former co-worker (until I get caught) I'm not sure which way is up anymore. Oh yeah, don't forget blowing the engine on the convertible so I have to ride my bike into work, and NOW, after the driest winter on record, it decides to rain like the bejeezus every day.  But only on my commute.  aahhh.  if ya can't bitch to the computer, who CAN ya bitch to?

      I talked with a puddle today  and asked what wisdom she was willing to give. She was quiet a long time, and I was afraid I had offended.  At the end of our silence she spoke.   “First,” she murmured,  “Tell me what you see.  Then I will give you my wisdom.”  I leaned and looked deep. “You are beautiful, brilliant, smooth and difficult to hold Soft when I caress, hard as stone when I use force. You are transparent.  I can see what supports you. As your environment changes, so you accept the change, becoming what serves the elements: vapor, liquid, ice. And yet, don’t you still keep the same essence throughout a lifetime of change?”  I dribble you through my fingers, disturbing your rest. I’m amazed how quickly you return to your peace leaving willingly a part of you with me, absorbed through my skin, cleansing me Accepting my gift of unrest as  ripples playing on your surface –  changing your boundaries.  The birds tell me about you, too. They say you taste like stone and purple delight.  I decide to taste you, too It’s true! Liquid dust, the fragrance of things remembered, sweet regret, sweet truth in forgiveness, chance, another opportunity.  I taste again, my tongue exclaiming Chill! Refresh! What a kick! I wonder that you can be so many things at the same time and still be true.  and yet you are.  We rested silent again, a long time this time comfortable, for I know I had spoken truth.  At last, my puddle (mine, for now I knew her) my puddle spoke: “Here is my wisdom,” she whispered. I leaned close to hear. “I only reflect what is.  I have nothing else to give.”  Silence deafened. I drank what she gave. When I felt I understood, I looked to her for confirmation. I saw only my own eyes, and then she was gone. The universe had need of her now.  I mourned her passing, and tears filled her bed.  A new puddle smiled and whispered, “Hello, Beautiful.”
