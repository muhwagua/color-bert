       current tune:  plumb - damaged remix it's the end of the semester and everything's going to hell around me. and i'm left standing in the wasteland.  only a few updates to the website cos i've been working on my project, which is swallowing all my time. and not moving.  updates: guestbook, accessible from the main page. pixelcore link. which should be on the top of this page. it will be on the links page soon, and i may be working on a new splash page that's less confusing.

       current tune:  varro - vicious pink so..... last night i attended the  urlLink urbanlab  lecture at uic, where they discussed their recent works.  Sarah Dunn was my professor for third year studio. It was interesting to see someone making intelligent decisions about what a city should be. now if they could just get something built.....  after that I walked in the rain to hawkeyes with some friends i hadn't seen in a while. yes, go ahead and blame me for not walking up the two flights of stairs to see you.  that works both ways, you know. as far as the website goes, i've updated the posable street furniture project to match my new iframes theme. i'm reworking the gallery so it works with my new smaller window size. and today, i'm looking for guestbook software and blog software that don't require perl.

       current tune:   interpol - stella was a diver and she was always down i   hate   conversations about money.  i hate having to think about it.  i don't want to be that guy.  but on some level money is part of everything - my social life, my eating habits, and a million other things that it isn't for someone who gets paid regularly.  every itime we talk about it i end up so depressed i can't function the rest of the day. so here i am in the middle of a perfectly good workday, trying to summon a sugar high from laffy taffy, and typing in my blog.  kill me. i hate the thought of trying to find another job. i hate the thought of leaving this one.  but i can't keep putting up with this.  every light at the end of the tunnel turns into a train wreck.  if i leave, it ends, but i sell out the dreams i had for this job and for my career. i know that's melodramatic, but i'm beyond being able to stop myself.  smash me. i tried to write about how happy i was to hang out with eric again last night.  i tried to remember how akward i felt being told that he respected me. i tried.  erase me. i can't remember what it was like to not worry about how i'm going to pay for groceries in 2 weeks.  i can't remember what it was like to

       current tune:   jerry cantrell - angel eyes so, there's this theory going around that you are every person in your dreams.  it makes a certain amount of sense.  even though the personalities of your friends are there, the events of the dream are still decided by you.  subconsciously.  what does that mean when you have a dream about your lover cheating on you?  i'm in a position to ask this question; and i know i could never cheat on anyone.  part of my being the emotional equivalent of an 8-yr-old girl...  it would kill me to be on the recieving end of that, so much that it ruins my ability to even think about doing that to someone else.  i get that i'm looking around to defer the wieght of my girlfriends dream, rather than doubting myself. damn. i find myself acting out the worst incarnation of myself when we argue.  you're the only one i could lean on this winter, and i feel so guilty.  yet i still handicap our relationship.  i recognize your needs, but i fall on my face rather than try to fulfill them.   talking to ben this morning, it turns out his relationship is 180 degrees away from mine.  his girlfriend invites him to a a big sisters bowl where her (twelve-year-old) girls proceed to pester benfor two hours. who has nothing to do but sit there and pretend like it's not happening.  bored out of his mind, stuck and unable to leave, that's sort of the position i don't want to put somebody in.  but i should've done it in a better way. in other news, i'm really tired of alcohol.  people who get drunk to get laid, get drunk as something to do on friday night, and think that if they don't get drunk, they aren't having fun.  better living through chemistry? sure, have fun.  just don't think you're better than me because of it. and by the way, don't call me an ass because i've learned that drinking does not lead to my problems solving themselves.

       current tune:   mirah - body below "what starts as desire sometimes turns into need" - that's a line from the song i'm listening to.  usually mirah is just bizarre, overly slutty, blah.  but that line.... it's so true of so many of my friends.  it's interesting to watch, but it always sort of scares me.  actually it really reminds me of the first scene where billy bob thorton and halle berry get together in "monster's ball i hate it when religious debates flare up around me.  i'm just minding my own business, when suddenly there's "higher criticism" of the gospels going on around me.  this is the kind of discussion i'm not allowed to enter.  having been taught to take the bible on faith since age 2, my perspective is so completely other from anyone who wants to debate 1st century trivia about jesus' role in jewish society.  the worst part is, ben (short, jewish, and furry) who i get along with just fine doesn't really want to get into the conversation either.   the instigator is my boss's wife.   so, we can't really be rude and just ignore her.  nor can we belittle her for wanting to debate such an asinine topic with a post-christian and a post-jew.  so i'm stuck not saying what i really think, while trying not to sound condescending while i pander to her retarded viewpoint, unable to disagree because i have much bigger (and unrelated) issues with jesus.  i can't deal with these arguments, and normally, i would just walk away or put on my headphones.  but, i work here.

       current tune:   pinback - penelope as much as i love wasting money on myself.... i love spending it on other people more.... last night i went to dinner with my girl at this really cool place called bordo's.  it felt so good to just do something for fun and not worry about being broke.  it's been a long winter.  i think ivonne's the only reason i didn't break down and cease to function.  it's hard to be sad when you're love is returned.  matt (my boss) made a damn good attempt, tho. okay, i know. i can't blame matt for this winter.  i knew what i was getting into when i started working there.  and if it was too much i should have just left.  sometimes i just get in a rut, where i let bad things happen to me, because i can't see a better future.  now that confusion is gone, cus we're getting paid, but i don't know if i should try to go someplace else or not.  or whether doing so would constitute selling out my dreams. maybe i'll just ignore the whole thing and think about the next time i'll se my girl.

       current tune:  Godspeed, You Black Emperor - Manufactured Loops (Live)  do you ever wonder if your friends still like you, or if they just don't want to come out and say you're an annoyance?  i know that's sort of the musings of a grade school loser. i have a tendancy to kind of back off when i sense people pulling away.  this often leaves me sitting at home alone for weeks at a time.  sometimes, though i find out that either i was completely wrong, or a person has gotten over it. sometimes it goes in the opposite extreme, like last night, when i got a call from eric, who i haven't heard from in like 6 months.  he ran into my roommate, and had to call me... blah, blah, blah.... it was just really wierd to hear somebody so over-excited.

       current tune:  slackjaw - off the cuff since i have to start somewhere, i'll start with something important:  so here's the unabridged history of ivonne:  in the last year josh dated and broke up with this girl ivonne.  the break up was about 6 months ago, was josh-initiated, and left her pretty unhappy (at the time)  3 months later, she's healed some, but josh likes her even less, esp. due to post-breakup messiness.  however, josh doesn't want to lose their mutual friends, so we all start hanging out again, sporadically.  two months more and josh and i move in together, sporadically becomes a lot more.  in the next month ivonne and i realize we are both really attracted to each other.  i talked to josh about it as soon i realized that it was going somewhere, and he said he didn't care, he really didn't like her. so, like the headstrong fool i am, i go ahead, we go out on a date. only, when i talk to josh the next night, he's very uncomfortable with the situation. during this whole time, he's been talking to ben, and ben can't fathom that this isn't a problem for josh, and says so. the more ben suggests, the more josh agrees, and so we're now on the precipice of all-out war.  ben is a good architect, but he's got some severe emotional issues.  i'm no better, but he's the one messing up my life at the moment, so.... ya know. anyway, so eventually josh and i have enough conversation to the point where we realize that we'll both be miserable if things continue. so, date 2: adam breaks things of with ivonne.  ivonne calls josh to apologize, which somehow turns into an argument.  i find out about this the next morning when josh bitches ME out about the whole situation.  a week passes, and josh and i are still ready to kill each other.  at this point i realize that no matter what, the situation is three miserable people, since ivonne and i still really like each other.  so one night, me and josh go to a bar to hang out with ivonne and her friends.  we argue all the way there, but by proxy through jokes and any topic that comes up.  we get there, and it kind of dissolves, and ivonne and i are really excited to see each other. at this point i realize that the best way to minimize the number of miserable people in the world(read david hume to understand the importance there) is for me and ivonne to get back together, and just not talk about it.  at all. a week later, ben's emotional issues jump out hardcore, when josh and i make a joke about having a dog, which ben assumes/exaggerates this to mean ivonne, like josh is making fun of me.  (not true, he was making reference to the people on the first floor having a dog, which is always around.)  At this point it becomes very clear that ben is responsible for a sizable amount of the friction between me and josh.  which leads to lots of reconciliation.  not spoken, but tangible (i'd say).  which leads us to the present where theres two very happy people and one person who doesn't seem to care much at all.    sorry that was so.... clinical, but if it were more emotional, it would  be a lot shorter:  eeeee! i'm so happy! there's this girl i  reallyreallyreally like! her name's Ivonne!  so... yeah.

       current tune:   bright eyes - a scale a mirror and those indifferent clocks i'm a shmuk. i missed another family event due to my inability to cope with metra.  i feel awful, although it does no good.  i think from now on, i'll just take my bike on the cta, and ride the rest of the way to my parent's house.  at least then i would only be late, not S.O.L. anyway, enough whining. interpol tomorrow - woo hoo! interpol is so joy division-esque, i should hate them for it.  but they're really really good... they're more pop, and they have that consistancy of emotion, that lets me listen to them whenever things are stressing me out, and i feel better.  matt should by me the cd for that.  but he doesn't know it.   anyway, there's going to be some changes around here... hopefully soon you'll be able to comment on my entries.    current tune:   bright eyes - the calender hung itself as much as i hate arguing with thoe ones i love.... sometimes a small argument keeps a big one from being the end of the world.  i've had relationships where i never argue with the person, until.  until the one huge argument that blows the relationship to hell. you and i have issues sometimes, ivonne, but since we had a couple of hiccups, when it seems like there's an argument to kill the relationship,  it's not, since their's some antagonism built in.  maybe as i get older i put up with more shit, or maybe i just argue more. i think ben and i could always have some sort of friendship, since ours is almost entirely built on antagonism...   yeah, that thought didn't come out the way it started in my head... oh well

       current tune:   glassjaw - siberian kiss one of the most interesting (to me) things about "the matrix reloaded" is the love scene where neo and trinity call each other by their hacker aliases.. this is one of the things that the wachowski brothers do well - pulling not just biblical themes and content, but the type of storytelling.  name changes are always the final sign of a change. abram becomes abraham, joseph becomes isreal, saul becomes paul.. the matrix is a little odd tho, since they named themselves, so it has a tinge of self determinism. which leaves me in an akward position.  faithless is a pretty bad alias.   faith, hope and  love current tune:   glassjaw - must've run all day is faith different than trust? i only ask because of my lousy choice in nicknames.  i chose it because of my unwillingness to take on faith that which i don't understand. yet.... when i ask someone to trust me, am i a hypocrite?  or is trust based on something else.... do i trust you becuase i know you, or because i want to? if i can trust someone, am i not faithless? i've known for a while now, that i'm not truly faithless, that i do belive things, things that allow me to define myself.   this is me attempting to purge my hypocrisy.  i can't blame others for not trusting me, when in another breath i won't take anything on faith.

        current tune:   cursive - the radiator hums "i threw out the phone to try to get throught to you" it's lines like that which make cursive so enjoyable.  the first reading is senseless, but the second is so emotionally brutal, partly because the first read prevents you from preparing yourself.  i want to write like that.... i'm joining a tennis club today in an attempt to keep my physical form from becoming my father's.  and an attempt to make this summer better than this winter. wow, am i still talking? about nothing....

       current tune:   the dismemberment plan - come home today, k2 was the worst incarnation of itself. ben and emily have never really acted much like exes.  except since she started working at k2.  why she feels the need to tooss that factoid into jokes, insults and conversations.... i can't get my head around it.  but today, they traded barbs like typicals exes.  they're both abrasive personalities, as am i, but this was different. jump to the beginning --> the conversation started with a sort of laundry list of people from school that ben, josh and emily disliked.  which is the gossip part.  i hate it.  all of you know i've thrown away the morals my church tried to give me.  except the one about gossip.  don't ask me why.  some susceptible part of my conscience, i guess.  somewhere in  there magda came up, which irked me in and of itself.  while emily railed on against her, ben tried to explain the other side of the argument, but without tact, as always.   as he tries to explain to emily why some people might not get along with her, her face turns sour.   like the kind of sour where you disbelieve what you're being told, and assume it's the creation of the one who's telling it.  or something.  ben can't see this because there's two computers between him and her.  i can see this happening, the hurt and defiant indignation, but it's not my fight.  like the dream where you're unable  to stop the impending car crash.  from there it just delves further into inappropriate territory for work.  it just hurts to watch. we've lost any opportunity now to turn back.  we'll only become less accountable, more bitter and antagonistic.  protestant self-loathing is so despicable, but it does give you the desire to be the best version of yourself.  but lacking any positive input, i'm only trying to stem the tides of my own argumentitive, self-righteous, egocentric self.  i need better friends.   that was the most whiny, hand washing blog ever.  ever.

       current tune:   strata - sleep seriously, any body reading this (except ben), GO download some  urlLink strata .  they just keep growing on me.  granted they have some weak songs, but still.. anyway. i'm in a position where i wish the u.s. were more socialist.  my girl needs help, but finances are an issue.  if not for nemesis, i'd be in much more a position to help.  especially since, without spending all of my TIME on the big black box, i'd have a less distorted view of what's important.  by the way, i'm talking about my new computer (hostname=nemesis, named for a grip inc. album).  i keep running right to the top edge of the stress i can handle for alternating reasons.  one minute my hard drive fries, the next, my girl needs me more than i'm worth.  ben, if you're bored and reading this, could you lay off at work?  i can't distinguish between what's real and what's sarcasm anymore.  no offense, i just need a break somewhere.  and thank you for the breaks you've already given me.  strata - when it's all burning a digresion on smoking (up) there's something about smokers and pot-smokers, that they get enough grief from people about it, they assume everyone who doesn't smoke, is on the other side of some line in the sand.  then there's me.  i've been a smoker, i'm not now, except sometimes.  i used to smoke pot, until i realized that i was wasting the gifts others were giving me since i wasn't getting high.  it's not that i think people shouldn't, or that it's just not for me,  i just have never gotten high, so i don't partake.  like communion.(worst analogy, ever) i feel bad. i called my mom today, because she and a couple of sisters have had experience with what my girl is going through.  which left her in the awkward position of having to indirectly ask me about my sex life. my mom and i talking about sex, it's like eric(that 70's show) and his mom going to a woody allen movie together.  the transmission of content is purely internal.  the words don't hold the meaning, they just facilitate the body language that does the work.  i feel bad because my mom really cares, but my not being the good kid means that she's always unsure where the conversation will lead.  strata - you are eternal sidenote: when i watch that 70's show, i identify fiercely with eric.  when ivonne watches it, she sees a lot of me in Red, eric's dad.  funny how all the time i'm worried about becoming my dad, when really, i should be trying to realize that i'm going to become him, i just have to be okay with that. and i'm spent.

       current tune:   dieselboy - eclipse so my new computer is up..  jon has my old one. haha, fuck off:lyle.   really wierd weekend.  saturday i went to a graduation party for my former next door neighbor.  all his (older) sister's friends kept coming up to me and saying "do you remember me?"  which leaves me feeling completely awkward, cos i don't.  i usually avoid that by way of the shaved head and the goatee where an afro and a boyish grin are expected.  but alas, i'm the expected fourth member of my family. sunday, i found out that nothing about LBC resembles what it was when i grew up there.  i haven't been in years, so this is more of a surprise to me than jon.(the other former LBC kid i still talk to)how does a church become so closed in on itself that it doesn't realize it's role in the world?  guess it's true about being "too heavenly minded to be any earthly good".  stupid catch phrases.  stupid people forgetting that the world goes on outside, and the only person that matters to is you.  if you teach kids that the entire world outside is sinners, and every desire they have is wrong, how do you expect them to cope?  the only reaction is of condescension mingled with jealousy.  leading to an ultimate personal failure that spreads back up to the source poisoning the view of god.  some people can contain it to the view of the church.  more and more i wonder if i had been raised in a different church, if i would still be a christian. but then i remember, that's like wishing i were a different me. i just finished reading matt segur's   soft power  .  "the award for most confusing book goes to...."  it kept falling out of it's conceit.  one of the many threads contained a character who had so much to do with someone i know.  it's wierd when you read a book or hear a song, that expresses someone's thoughts to you better than they do.  then you wonder if you're filtering either the song by the person or the person by the song.  i think in the end you have to throw away anything you think you learned from it. god i'm rambling.

       current tune:   Godspeed You Black Emperor! - Moya i guess i shouldn't have said anything. if i didn't want anyone to be involved.  if  i didn't want to grant it credibility.  if i didn't want my friends to feel they should apologize for themselves.   for their friends. i guess i should have let it go. now it's too late. jealousy shares only one point of commmonality with reality.  the moment of cognitive dissonance where your eyes cause you to reconsider what your heart believes.  from that moment, reality forgets you, and continues on its merry way as if nothing happened.   you.  you are now trapped in that moment.  in pure mental excercise.  jealousy turns from that moment into a mental copy of that mmoment, replaying until the conflict is resolved: you know your lover.  or do you.  you trust them.  but are they violating that trust? and how can you  ever know?  is to trust to allow that violation?  is there any violation worth even beginning this mental excercise? none of this can ever be solved.  the image in your head is now a copy of the original event, and thus unable to inform you about the event itself, or any of the players. p.s.  this i all from the noise inside my head, and possibly has nothing to do with the way others feel jealousy.  or maybe i'm just full of shit (thanks jason).

       current tune:   type o negative - i don't wanna be me some days are just perfect from the word go.  i woke up this morning next to  my girl, which is just always excellent.  i biked home, stopped at a coffee place and had an amazing breakfast, then finished biking home.  i took a shower and went to see 28 days (by myself, since no one else was interested).  i discovered that everyone who goes to the movies by themselves sits in the back row, which is kinda cool cuz then you can all laugh out loud without being self-conscious. btw; the film was excellent, i recommend it to everyone. on my way home i stopped by the MCA to see doug garrafolo's outdoor installation.   urlLink left side   urlLink right side  immediately afterwards i got a call from my best friend since 3rd grade,  nick, who wants me to stand up in his wedding, which is cool.  i had to shorten the hone call tho, since i could tell it was going to rain.  i hang up, and a half block later the skies open.  fortunately i stop under a canopy for two minutes until the sun comes out.  so i finish the ride home slightly wet, but hey, summer rain is cool.

       current tune:   chris vrenna - fortress of doors (tweaker remix) so, this is that weekend i told josh about.  the one where i don't have any money left to go out.  where i said dual monitors was worth one weekend like this.  and i have to say.. i like being by myself.  josh is downstate with family, so the only people i interact with are unreal players and soulseek users.  very cool.  tuesday i'm doing a photoshoot with jon's band.  since when am i the kind of photographer that does "shoots"?  i don't know.  photography is always secondary to the post production for me anyway.  lets hope that makes me somewhat of a worthwhile choice for the PD's.

       current tune:   cave in - until your heart stops i'm blogging because everyone, myself is included is tired of ammar's sordid affair. all the smart things i had to say this weekend dissolved the minute i openned my mouth.  why is that?  in the end, breaking up is a simple thing.  one quick slash and the beast (that's a metaphor for the relationship) falls headless, lifeless, to the floor.   i'm left wondering why it took me so long to pull my heart out of it.  it went sour in less than a week,  but it wasn't my turn to let go of it.  then we were both left holding onto something (the beast), because we were just afraid to let go. people will want to know why, after nursing the beast back to health, i gave up on it.  i guess i just took some time off and was able to see it for what it was:  all the band-aids holding limbs together, while the heart was still hemorraging inside. people confuse the outward solidarity for the existance of a living being. i guess it's just been a while since i was honest with myself or anyone else. if this doesn't answer the nagging why's for anybody, remember that this blog is only a record of the noise inside my head.  and i'm not responsible for the why's, only for what my heart wants.

       current tune:   a perfect cirle - blue the state of illinois would love to punish me every time i refer to myself a an architect.  tough luck, i'm not going into a 20-minute explanation for every one who doesn't know that being an architect requires licensing.  i'm calling myself an architect until further notice. further notice would be if/when i decide not to ever go back to grad school, since i've seen plenty of the field and don't think it's warranted.  perhaps i'm just bitter because of the way K2 works.  we have one or two projects which matt deems design-worthy (little black pearl workshop, a possible casino)  which we work on more than we get paid for (as an office).  then, we have the rest of the projects that get us by for money.   if i go to grad school, and work at k2 another year and a half, i can get a license so i can do the same thing except with it being my designs i'm whoring, not matt's.  whoopie.   is it time then for me to say, hey i've got a job which gets me by but i'd rather move to a different field if i'm going to spend another two years in school? or, maybe i just need to work at a different firm which will make me unjaded by having real design projects, and not having to sacrifice to get them.  i'm not sure i can think of one example of such a firm. ben's friend burt, who did some renderings for K2 just got hired by ILM for 3.5 times what i make.  he recieved a competitive bid from EA games.  what am i in this business for again?  if i can create space that people inhabit in a realm where good design isn't more expensive, just more desirable, for 3 times the money, what's the point? i need a nap.  i just spent 8 hours doing demo on  our new office space.

       current tune:   Alkaline Trio & Hot Water Music - Queen of Pain so, all my seclusion has led up to this:    urlLink DM-Oasis7  If i can't get along with people, at lest i can find tools for venting my hate.  I always thought i was the kind of person who would live without regrets, but sometimes, you can get to a point with a person that everything about them is so awful, you can't remember what you used to think was good about them.  it's despicable, and i wish i wasn't trying to edit history, but this mindblowing hate is eclipsing reason.

       current tune:   LBC - slip i get too damn tired of the suburban weekends.  i look out the window and i see miles of empty framed at either end by the same stand of starbucks, denny's and 7-eleven's.  it's a shame alll my relatives have too live out there.  otherwise i'd visit more often.  really i would... anyway, i'm still stuffed two days later.  thanksgiving is so much fun.  i'm still trying to work myself out of my family's 'black sheep' status.  my moom's family is really cool, but my parents are the sober ones.  the ones who are always in the corner looking like the judgemental baptist $%#@'s they are.  so i drink and smoke and don't talk to them, and i get a little fewer of the - "are we really related to them?" looks. funny how being the sober ones would be the thing that gets you black sheep status....

       current tune:   Mindless Self Indulgence - Bitches (playing in my head) Pat - you were right, it's a damn good thing you dragged all our sorry asses out to see the lucy boy convention.  apparently i overestimated how good of a show  urlLink MSI / urlLink Tubring  would be.  mindless was much less energetic in person.  plus, i was expecting an ass-kicking on the level of the  urlLink relative ash  show.   no such luck.  relative ash still holds the record for most insanest show ever. what should be noted here, tho - tubring fucking rocked.  they played about 300 times tighter than their album release party.  plus, i actually knew their songs this time around.  the keyboardist was a little less crazy this time, but turns out he was playing both sets cos the mindless keyboardist was on injured reserve.    i guess the johnny urine tried a little to show some energy, but having him kneeling on me and the crowd while he sang  didn't really compare to the whole "i touched richard patrick's ass" thing.  i think he had to try to hard to sing decently to put much energy into the performance. my main complaint, tho was the audience.  here's where LBC comes in.  the house of blues is just way more fun of a place to get crazy.  the metro is too small, and there were too many people to really move much.  although the goth chicks were cuter and crazier, they were still mostly in high school (look, don't touch) - except for one girl who couldn't seem to stand up on her own for about 15 minutes.  about 90% of that time i had my hand under her back so she didn't wind up getting stepped on.  but at the metro, the floor doesn't bounce, so it can't really compare. so - you've waited, here it is:  top five most dissapointing/worst shows (all time)  #5 -  urlLink Enon  - Fireside - Perfect example of the fireside sound: way too loud.  and the set was a half hour, headlining: wtf? #4 - The Mars Volta - Riv 11/03 - Bad sound, whiny little bitch singer, and way too much jam #3 - Local H/LBC/Box-O-Car - Uic Pavilion - bad sound, bad singing, local H sux, and we missed box-o-car #2 -  urlLink Tomahawk/Melvins  - Vic 09/03 - Mike Patton is good on cd, but not live anymore #1 -  urlLink Cursive /Blood Brothers  - Metro 10/03 - sold out while we were in the car on the way to buy tickets. and i fucking love cursive  top 5 shows of all time  #5 - Kenny Wayne Sheppard Band/Van Halen - I still loved eextreme - and gary fucking rocked out all those great DLR lines.  best stage presence on this list. #4 - Mr. Bungle/Incubus/System of a Down - Riv Winter 2000 - a confluence of greatness #3 -  urlLink Touniquet  - somewhere  - one of my few good memories of  urlLink jay mathes : him, ryan nesslerode(sp?), and nick gray.  #2 -  urlLink Dredg  - fireside 12/02 - the elbo room show was good, but this was perfect.  el cielo played dead on like fucking metal.   #1 - Nine Inch Nails/A Perfect Circle - UIC Pavilion 12/01 - needs no explanation, just wish we were

       current tune:  hot water music - god deciding sorry jon, no boston. apparently pat still reads this, so i guess somebody should update this piece of shit.  coincides with my getting kidnapped this weekend.  apparently people think i have some ability to work on cars.  thanks dad - i've become you - the backyard mechanic.  except i don't own a car. i never miss owning a car until i'm in the suburbs.  i was missing the suburbs cos i haven't had taco bell in a year.  this weekend was kind of like my first cigarette after having quit for a year.  everything came back in a rush - everything. saturday i got all the neighborliness, the smiles and hospitality when jon and i worked on his bosses' car in isaac's driveway.  i guess i miss the father figures or something.  but sunday was all the suburbia i hate - a million miles from everywhere with a car as the only 'place' that lend physical contact.  the strip mallls and fast food - they're not real, not in a way that you can stay there, or get any attachment to.  they're only milemarkers, not destinations.  the car is where you live.  current tune: hot water music - loft  so, apparently the internet has become a place where people play with the hearts out, for real.  i'm at work, but there's two topics of conversation: 1 - the hilarity of my playing scrabble online and flirting with a married girl from germany who's ridiculously hott for me.  2 - emily's outrage and being 'friendster'd' by  someone she didn't want to.  the married girl's tears and sense of loss at having real feelings for me vs. the artifice of internet flirting.    also, emily's indignation at this other girl's inviting herself into emily's friend circle vs. the non-reality of a friend circle on a static website. god, i'm inarticulate tonight.  that's the reason for m silence - my own inability to form a clear opinion about shit.

LOTR commentary is good material for sleeping too..zzzzz

       current tune:   far - girl my roommate is going to die in his sleep.  after i smother him with a pillow, i'll chop his body into little tiny pieces and flush it down the toilet. after running around doing holiday shopping and card mailing(dorky, i know, but i had fun sending them to all the people i thought least wanted them. watch out!!)this morning, i laid down on the couch to watch buffy.  i woke up in the middle of it, and josh comes out of his room and looks around the apartment.  he announces "i'm going to clean the apartment, so let me know if there's anything of yours you don't want thrown away"  i'm like  urlLink wtf mate?    seriously.  who says that like it's something reasonable?  when he said that, he'd already thrown out the pile of new mail that was awaiting readership. so i had to dig that out of the trash (the 25% that was actual mail, anyway).  my head's gonna pop  good thing there's only three months of him left..  but then i gotta find a new one, who's less mental...

       current tune:   better than ezra - desperately wanting feeling a little nostalgic today.  i love the way music does that to me.  i can't listen to this better than ezra CD without thinking of driving around in dave's '92 honda prelude.  unless i think of some other time, listening to this, and thinking of dave.  all my music has some association like that.  dave's the only one of my friends/cousins who's getting married that it doesn't bother me.  i think it always seemed odd that he wasn't married... i dunno. also on the list of adam's brain functions that aren't quite clear to him is why i have such a bizarre thing for preludes, or why dave hold such a high respect value, even when everyone else i went to church with, i can barely stand.  i guess he's the one person i never had any doubt believed what he was talking about.  maybe cos he thought a lot the same way i did. anyway, i think i ought to fly out to San Diego for the wedding.  maybe i'll make a big tour of the continent, and hit up Victoria..  but that depends on how things go next month, i guess.  good god i can't wait :grrrrrr:

       current tune:   ours - sometimes so josh was right, the show last night was UNFOOKINBELEEEVABLE.  yeah, it's reeeally jeff buckley-ish, but his songwriting is soooo good.  and his voice is just devouring of anything else in the world.  it was amazing to see somebody that talented in such a small venue.  the only bummer of the night was cale crying into his beer about the girl he broke up with that morning.  then there was josh, asking if it would be cool if he hung out with megan anyway, cos, she's cool and she lives so close...  what marvelous tact.  luella and i kinda wanted to hide under a rock at that point. so i'm now appointed with the task of finding a new roommate. which is kinda scary, cos nobody i know wants to live in the city, and i can't stand the thought of moving BACK to the suburbs.  if i do, it wouldn't be that far from moving back into my parents house.  carmella (bosses wife) says she knows people who are looking for an apartment, but none that she'd move in with, so i think i can cross them of. cos i'm pretty sure i wouldn't even live with her, without going insane.   since i've already started in on music, i'll go on with a little diatribe.   urlLink bleep.com  finally opened last week.  personally, in terms of what [the music industry] is and what [m] should be, i think it's a move in the right direction, unlike itunes.  itunes seeks to REPLACE the record store and maintain the current chain of parasites.  their selection sucks by necessity, since there's just too much music out there for anyone to get arms all the way around.  and it's not like they can special order it for you.   Bleep.com is something else.  it's an attempt to remove one stage of middle man.  it fulfills something missing from all the search engines - reliability.  they have ALL the master to draw from.  they're realeasing everything from their [warp records] catalog in MP3 format, not some newfangled, rights-managed format.  apparently in a fit of drunkenness this saturday i bought the two AFX releases they have up so far.  both are out of print vinyl 7' e.p.s that are nearly unfindable on  urlLink soulseek . i have no problem supporting an endeavor like this.  imagine if all record companies could be encouraged to do this.  not feasable for the big three, but say for saddle creek, sub pop, wax trax [insert favorite small label here]... it would be amazing.

       current tune:   hot water music - god deciding apparently i'm nightmare inducing even to girls who haven't met me in person. ugh. i hope it wasn't another one about me cheating, cos that would start to wierd me out, like god was trying to tell me something. "adam, stop it with this one woman at a time gig, it's tired"  that whole paragraph makes no sense.  anyway, the cute  urlLink girl  is coming to visit me next month, so hopefully she won't have anymore nightmares about me before that happens.  looks like this isn't going to turn into a real journal entry, so here's a little anecdote about me having the attention span of a gerbil:  i biked to microcenter tonight, and in the process of locking up my bike, managed to forget that i'd set my gloves on the handlebars.  they were nice gloves, really.  got 'em from a bike shop on north avenue.  now they're gone, cos it didn't occur to me that i had even brought gloves until i started rolling home and my hands started to freeze.  now i'm sitting here in my boxers cos i'm to overheated to wear anything else, and my quads are about to catch fire cos i haven't ridden in a month.  but my hands can barely work the keyboard from being numb. wow, what a waste of time this was.  i'm gonna go listen to this song another 15 times in a row.  i love songs that i can actually do that to.

NYE was cool... i wound up spending it in the suburbs on accident, but it was ok.  kind of a wierd party cos i knew like 3 people, all guys, going into it.  but it turned out ok.  ben tells me i'm withdrawing, and eventually i won't be able to deal with "the world" on anybody else's terms but my own.  great, the hermit is telling me i'm anti-social.  so i made sure i did SOMETHING for NYE so i could check to see if i'm getting worse.  i'm not. but i am pretty damn quiet at parties.

       current tune:  sarah mclachlan - trainwreck i took a weekend off from the world.  i spent it coccooned where i could only experience beauty and pleasure and caring.  i thought that i would come back to find these elements highlighted in the world i had left. fu-uck. how is it that people you know for years ( or, "know" ?) suddenly show themselves to be completely other?  and you suddenly realize that every halfway-friend that you share with this person is more worth saving than they.  and you don't cringe at the edge of the abyss where that "friend" may depart.  and you don't worry they might not make it, only for those in the blast radius.  and you Know that things can't go back. damn objectivity.  this post was supposed to be about this sweet, drop dead hott girl from BC that i've been missing, but after twelve hours at work, i found myself buried back in the same scene i was before she came.  only difference was, i had no cloud in my eyes about some of the people in it.  the maps are clear, of who's who, and who can be trusted.  wow, i just switched topics back again.  i'll wait for daylight to make any further attempts at clarity.

       current tune:   aimee mann - deathly i should've blogged this earlier, before i had time to miss her.   so, that girl, came, and, i couldn't have overestimated how amazing it would be.  i feel soooo sappy right now, cos i want to go on about all the cute things we said and did.  i spent the rest of today cleaning up, and finding all the random little artifacts of the visit, and reading the book she gave me.  and re-listening to this song that was completely inappropriate and awkward when it came on mid-sushi-making. it's probably a sign of me giving up on humanity that i'm willing to commit to the longest of all possible long-distance relationships, but i can't make myself not want to invest everything in this girl. but hey, i'm checking out everything the  urlLink CACB  has to offer, although i'm sure i'll find it's easier to get a canadian license if you have an american one... and it all seems really.. all-consuming: the thought of transfering all my plans to another country for something so new. but i've lost some frame of reference that says i should miss my friends more, because i'm across a border, rather than 30 miles away where we still never talk.  except my (post) youth group friends, who are still cool. anyway, i should go to bed, cos i don't seem to remember much in the way of sleep this weekend.  oops.

       current tune:   deftones - passenger w/mjk last night pat and i had the conversation that we've been supposed to have since the afformentioned summer.  about why, why would i not tell anyone if i knew jon was going to attempt suicide. fu-uck. yeah, i know, what kind fucking asshole am i?  or, how much other destructive shit did i not tell people about?  lots.  that was one effed-up summer.  the amount of shit we stole, the amount of time we spent trying to cause ourselves enough pain to make us forget everything,  the driving to nowhere, illinois and back just so we didn't have to be around anybody.   some of it people know about, some of it's not worth explaining.  but really, to say that i pushed jon towards it, as pat so brutally laid it out as... is not wrong.  i do feel responsible.  and i did know how serious jon was that night, and i didn't tell anybody, or even make a real attempt to discourage him.  i guess because i thought that if he could go through with it, then i could too.  [silly magda, calling right in the middle of me testing the strengh of my skin against a box cutter]  there's an angle of this whole thing that i can't blame pat for missing:  this was a lot of the same thing for both of us.  by my feeling some of the same things as jon, that's how i pushed him towards it.  if i could have healed myself, i could have pulled jon out of it.  but i couldn't, and my depression pushed jon further into his.  do i wish that i had said or done something to prevent jon from going to the edge? yes.  instead all i did was suggest a different method. i am a fucking asshole.  but in my journey towards the bottom, i found myself lacking any reasons for staying alive.  i smiled everytime we passed around blind curves and prayed for unseen oncoming cars.  anything was better than going back to school the next year to find i'd flunked out, and to the friend who i wanted so badly to be something more, but couldn't manage to say something to, or to the people who couldn't manage to get over the fact that i wasn't interested in going to heaven anymore.

       current tune:   dream theater - honor thy father i just put an ad in the reader for a new roommate.  this one's all used up. i need a new one. or something like that.  i've ben feeling less congenial to him since saturday. so.. cale broke up with his girlfriend megan, like two weeks ago. then, they were still hanging out, and it became something weird, and cale broke up with her, again.  saturday.  so saturday josh has a date with this girl from  urlLink match.com  which, apparently i wasn't supposed to mention to megan, or her friend kim.  because josh kinda likes kim.  and he's not ready to pursue either one exclusively.  i'm pretty good with being covert about things, but i kinda need to know up front when i'm expected to lie. anyway, where was i going with this? oh yeah.  so after josh left, megan calls, and we (me, her, kim, other random girls) go out to drunken megan out of her fresh dumpedness.  megan has decided she and kim should be truthful, so as they come into my apartment, megan announces that kim likes josh.  other truths revealed that night: josh is still pissed at adam about the ivonne thing.  megan thinks adam is cute. so yeah, josh and i went grocery shopping today, and didn't even say two words to each other the entire time.  i think he's vaguely pissed at me about the ivonne thing, and pissed about me telling kim that he was on a date.  or maybe he heard that i explained that he liked kim too.  maybe i am evil, who knows...

       current tune:   third eye blind - blinded so that's it, now it's past.  this is the last time i dredg the past up all over again.   the girl who moved to Kansas City to get married after we broke up-  [rewind] okay, so josh (and me, somewhat) was friends with joe, chuck and geo in college.  which is the group of friends that lead to him dating ivonne.  well known fact - joe cheated on missy [long-time gf] a fair amount.  while I was dating ivonne, chuck decides to tell missy about all of this, which effectively cuts off chuck from joe, geo, AND ivonne. which never seemed to me as strange at the time.... especially since chuck's intentions weren't completely altruistic - he kinda had a thing for missy at the time. [ffwd] -SHE was one of the ones who joe cheated on missy with! i never found out, cos i was dating ivonne, and effectively cut off from chuck.  so chuck was effectively ending her 'friendship' with missy (they were even roommates at one point).  i danced around the office high fidelity style when josh told us that yesterday.  yeah, it makes sooo much more sense now.

       current tune:  opeth - a fair judgement apparently i used the word fiance in my last entry without explaning what's going on. see, there's this girl, and she's really amazing, but, there's this problem. she's not only reeeeally far away, but she's across the border.  which means it's really hard for us to manage to get closer to each other.  so, there's all sorts of internship visas and other things that we're looking into, but this girl is so perfect, and fits to me just the way i've always wanted, that i can't stand to be without her much longer.  so, after spending 3+ hours on the phone  a night, i really can't say i would much object to the thought of being married.  because any work related emmigration to canada involves just as much commitment ($10,000 in savings, which would take 2+ years)  and i'm completely all for that.  but the job market is better in the US, and there's this other plan, which would involve the same level of commitment, only we'd get to be together sooner.   by this i mean a fiance/marriage visa.  soooo, after i go visit her in may, and we have pictures and phone records and all manner of other evidences to prove to my government that we DO actually belong together, which, is pretty obvious, except that they would only be seeing us seperately, not together, so they require all sorts of "documentation"... whatever.   so, yes, the word fiance is somewhat appropriate, but that seems more geared toward the frilly weddings all my friends are having, that make everyone go insane, and spend months organizing flowers and dinners and everything, puke, which is such a bizarre custom that should have never gotten so out of hand. so, odds are it will be a small thing, either in vegas, or running barefoot through a field somewhere, just us, and maybe a parent or two. i'm sure this sounds really bizarre and out of blue to some people, and it feels really sudden, but doesn't feel at all wrong. [ opeth - by the pain i see in others ] which doesn't mean i'm without stress, because K2 is having pay problems again, although allegedly only for this one month.,  i finally got paid yesterday what i was meant to recieve on the 15th.  i'm out of reasons to justify staying there. really.  lyle showed me figures that look like we should be good through the end of the year, which would be nice, because i can't seem to wrap my mind around 2 major life changes in one season.  (getting married and changing jobs).  it sucks, because there's still a lot i want to learn from K2, and to get to most "above intern level" jobs, they look for 3-5 years experience, which would take another year.  but, if i can't rely on getting paid on time, i can't justify staying there.   my freaking head is going to pop. on the plus side, there are other architecture/drafting jobs in chicago this time.  last winter there weren't, so that's good.

       current tune:   appleseed cast - hanging marionette 5.  leave an indelible imprint on your world that will surely outlive you 4.  the chance to play out your design fantasies in a real way. 3.  the joy of getting underpaid for a job you won't leave because you love. 2.  really excellent skills at FPS games from using making your autoCAD pgp the based on wasd 1.   NEVER EVER having to worry about a girlfriends's parents liking you.   so i finally took the plunge and told my parents about the girl.  and her being from canada.  and the possiblity of me moving very far from them. "the girl" who some refer to as "fiance" and for this should die. just because it's such a stupid word.  and because it makes the whole thing waaay more standard issue than it is.

       current tune:   pedro the lion i'm getting comfortable in the skin i'm in.  with every day i feel more sure of where i'm headed, more resolute, with every long phone cal, i fall asleep happier.  which is disturbing at times, when other people aren't so comfortable, but lately i keep having this notion that i can overcome any obstacle, no matter how much the accountants in my head keep telling me the future is unreachable on the current budget.  maybe that's why tyler barred the door and set fire to their ledger pads. whups, i wasn't supposed to tell people about the war in my head... theology only makes you love god less, and sometimes that's true on earth too, knowing the GPS coordinates of every bend in the path to heaven, doesn't make it more attainable, only your iron will can do that.  my rational mind to often locks my heart out of the control room, but lately my hearts been the one with the keys, and reason's been locked in with the accountants.  funny how my heart feels no remorse.   even if he cared for the accountants, he'd still be quite happy to be too poor to have any need of them.  but right now he's feeling a little to happy to believe that any obstacle may arise.  wishful thinking? sure, but he's my heart, what did you expect?  give him an ounce of power and he'll take over the world. (zooming sound as the camera pulls back out of the war in adam's head to focus on him smiling and staring wistfully in the direction of british columbia)

       current tune:   appleseed cast - strings i said i would tell people how things went when that girl came to visit.  but then when they came over i was kinda drunk and there was kind of a party happening. so, yeah. this is copied from when i wrote about it earlier, on another site that nobody i know visits....  all i really want to talk about anymore is the inSanely adorable, sexy, funny, smart, cool, amazing red-haired girl that i got to be with this weekend. i was soooo nervous when i saw her in the airport, and the whole ride back, apparently for no reason at all, cos she's ok with my being all fucktarded. so, yeah, we didn't spend much time with other people thursday, cos.... well after we kissed i couldn't think, and was probably pretty useless to other people. so friday we stayed away from everybody, and watrched silly movies and read to each other, and watched more silly movies, and had lots of cuddling, which was the best of all. and lots of looking at each other all funny. which kinda makes me feel all retarded, especially when she says all this really sweet stuff about me that can't possibly be true, but i smiled and gave her kisses anyway. then we realized we didn't eat at all, and tried to go be nice to the roommate and the rest of the world, but we gave up real quick, and went back to hibernating. then saturday we decided to go try to be social again... and despite the world's worst attempt to keep us from going places, we managed to get on the road, and i told her all these retarded stories, and rambled about nothing at all.. and generally scared her with my driving especially when i looked at her and kinda forgot that we were even moving. and then we got to madison, but kinda wanted to be back by ourselves again, cos nobody's as cool as ophelia (at least for my part, she was just kinda quiet and looked kinda sad, and i didn't want her to be sad, so.. yeah, sorry neil). so we started driving home again, and i scared her lots more (sorry). and then there was me being all unfit for public consumption, cos i was to crazy for the girl. once i stopped being so scary, there was lots of us saying all this scary stuff to each other, but we got home and hugged lots, so i felt better. then she said all these beautiful things and i just couldn't believe that she could be so damn perfect. really. she's the sweetest, and the coolest, and i can't even function around her. sunday we got up and made sushi, and talked and giggled, and generally made the roommate and his g/f real nervous. then The Cutest Girl In The World got real sick from all the crazy american food, and stuff, and somehow still looked adorable, but i felt real bad. then we drove to the airport and talked more, and she made me all woozy, saying all this stuff that sounded kinda like she liked me, and i think i managed to not sit there going "iloveyouiloveyouiloveyouiloveyou" cos i hear that comes across real creepy and stuff, but i think i still said lots of mushy stuff about how i'm all hers and she can do whatever she wants with me, and i think that was ok with her. then there was this evil building looming up in front of us, and everything was all messy, and with a kiss or twelve she was gone. so i had to drive home, and try not to rip off the steering wheel cos goodbyes are real sad

       current tune:   smashing pumpkins - for martha or easter.  and, my sister's birthday.  which meant i didn't have my home phone, which has unlimited calls to canada every month.  which is the rationale for my being on the phone all night every night.   which means, i didn't get to talk to my long distance girlfriend all weekend, except in brief interstitial moments.  sad face.  it's odd how, even though she's farther away, i spend more time talking to her than any other girlfriend ever got.  even magda, who i was in school with, and was around 12 hours a day, we didn't talk this much.  but i'm not very talkative. so, i guess it's not that surprising.  what's surprising is how much i enjoy being on the phone in spite of that. anyway, for a complete rundown of local events and forecasts, please visit  urlLink my other journal.  thank you, and good night.

       current tune:   modest mouse - the good times are killing me I'm sorry. I don't update in forever. then i go and post a picture of The Girl with engagement ring. Which people have correctly interpreted to mean that i am engaged to someone they have never met. I'm sorry to those of you that was a shock to (all of you). rewind. on may 7th boarded a plane for British Columbia by way of seattle. through the mindnumbingly awful misappropriation of runway space that is o-hare, i was unable to leave at 6:57 when i was meant to, but instead left 2 hours later, leaving me stranded overnight in SEA/TAC. I wandered about lots and comforted/was comforted by The Girl. nonetheless i spent a very lonely night cuddled up to leather airport furniture instead of the one i love. not to mention i had to switch locations every two hours, since i couldn't go to the terminal right away, since you can only sleep in the main terminal, not the south satellite.  mmmmm... regulations. on may 8th i arrived in British Columbia on a sunny morning which would have been perfect if i hadn't been so freaking tired. it's funny how you would think that after landing, clearing customs, and getting in the rental car i would be anxious and excited about meeting again someone who i'd only known in person for 3 days. But i felt none of that. There's something... undistracted about talking on the phone, that lets you have conversations that are more real and personal than trying to date, and make chat over dinner, movies, mini golf, pool, party noise, beer, and everything else we normally distract ourselves with.  So i wasn't anxious. I was happy, like I was driving home. I met her at the mall, briefly, to pick up keys. There was no kissing. None at all. ... After i slept and she worked and we got groceries, and met her mom, we had time to ourselves. So much time to ourselves. With occasional interruptions to have dinner with her mom and stepdad, and then with her brother.  ... Wednesday, May 12th: we decided to go downtown to pester her friend at work, cos we're mean like that. so in between pesterings, we went shopping. oddly enough at jewelry shops. really, i had no idea we were going there. or, i'm just kidding. after some hesitation as to whether the right ring was really the right ring, we skipped down to the harbor, where i proposed to her. i asked all properly and everything, although there wasn't a single doubt in my mind what she'd say.  Right before we sat down i realized how amazing that is. She's the most perfect girl i can imagine, who's cute and funny, far smarter than i am, hot as hell, and by far the best person i've ever met. It kills me everytime we're apart, and when we're together, i'm so in love and completely switched on at her every move and every glance that i can't function. and i knew she would say yes. i knew she loved me nearly as much. and there wasn't a single misgiving in my heart or my head about spending the rest of my life loving her. There's been times where i was dating the wrong person, and had horrible issues with commitment. All of that's gone. It's so perfect i can't even understand it. luckiest guy ever. ... So you've all seen the ring. And you know how happy i am. Unfortunately, none of you can come to the wedding. it's going to be extremely small. Immediate family at the most. Maybe we'll have dinner afterwords. That's all. we'll have a party for you guys at some point, but right now, the future's far to unclear to make any sort of plans about that. Except for the certainty that whatever happens will happen to us together.

Pantera - strength beyon strength :/ 4.  Dj shadow - build steam with a grain of salt 5.  The Appleseed Cast - a place in line 6.  The Wrens - Every year you wasted 7.  Probot - Ice Cold Man 8.  Roni Size - At the movies 9.  Belle and Sebastian - the fox in the snow 10. Red Hot chili Peppers - warm tape 11. Yakuza - T.M.S. 12. Sarah Mclachlan - Back Door Man 13. Modest Mouse - Bukowski 14. The Appleseed Cast - Beach Gray 15. Opeth - Patterns in the Ivy  there were more than a few i wan't in the mood for, but the only one that was really embarassing was pantera.  i'm realizing that most of my music is pretty mellow.  like i'm getting old or something.  or maybe it's just cos this is my work collection, which is like a quarter of my home collection.  i'd wait till i get home, but that won't be for a week.

       current tune:   dashboard confessional - hands down The Girl is here, and it's 19898733409113 times more amazing and wonderful than i could have imagined.  everytime i come home, there she is, perfect and cute, and everything that's ever gone wrong is fixed.  and i'm spending all day everyday wishing i was home so i could be with her. sometimes, apparently that goes to far.  i threw myself down a flight of stairs yesterday just before lunch.  i managed to knock the wind out of myself for the first time since third grade.  my back hurt so bad i coudn't concentrate, or even make a valid decision whether to saty at work or not.  which means that i should go home.  so after finishing the thing that i was doing before falling down stairs, i called a cab and went home.  of course, since it was my lucky dy, the cabbie picked someone else up and said that it was me, so my cab never came.  right after i called them back, my boss pulled out on his way to a meeting on the north side, and offered me a ride home.  from then on, i had the best day ever.  the sweetest girl in the world was looking over me, and brought me drugs and heating pads and cold things, and grape kool-aid. by 6pm i felt well enough to sit up.  so she cut my hair, cos she's perfect, and does a billion nice things for me every day.  she was all worried it wsn't good, tho, so we walked over to josh's for verification.  during said walk, i remembered that i had, indeed fallen down a flight of stairs earlier.  josh suggested some corrections amidst showing us his ant-hill birthday project/gift, so we walked back home and she made my haircut even perfecter. all this happiness, though, doesn't lead up to the weekend and me getting to be with her 24 hours a day.  instead i'm off to a wedding in san diego.  one of my best friends from nearly a decade ago.  i should be really happy about it, but instead i'm all worried about missing her.

        current tune:   sarah mclachlan - stupid to the fucktard who shall remain nameless.  i love a joke as much as you, maybe more.  but i can't stand stirring the pot just to stir.  if you have an issue with something i'm doing, tell me.  but not in the way you've done.  not while you're drunk, using jokes to cover the empty spaces where real thought might prevail over your assumptions.  not in a group, where half of what you sayis for entertainment.  if you want a real answer, ask a real question. as much as i used to go on at ben about being nosy, he's nosy to an end.  he won't let real disagreements fester unresolved.  that's not pot-stirring.  pot-stirring is when you make an assumption, and try to pick a fight, cos you think people should be having a problem. the girl and i went to our first family event together.  what was meant to be the proper fawning over her, didn't go as planned.  everyone was excited tomeet her,  but as people got drunk, one of my relatives decided to make an ass of himself                            by launching into joking about things in a way that lacked taste.  in a big way. props to my aunt (the host) for telling him he'd best go outside.  props to my mom for going outside and sticking up for us.  props to The Girl for not running and hiding.  or punching people.

       current tune:   prefuse 73 - uprock and invigorate funny how when you're not sleeping, or sleeping well, you're miserable, but when you are you can't help but take it for granted.  Also, for people like me who are horribly out of touch with what's really bothering them, dreams are a nice direct line from your subconscious.  last night i had a dream of matt yelling at me about something i screwed up on baymont, and said it was about time i started trying to find a replacement for myself.   sheesh. at least when i woke up, i felt a million times better, although i should've felt worse, because my stress has been directed elsewhere, since i wasn't recognizing my fears about "breaking" baymont.

Cos if i get involved i only ever make it worse, since i lack effective communication skills, or a sense of what's an appropriate solution to a problem. i suck.

       current tune:   ours - drowning i'm exhausted.. and deaf.  i like going to shows a lot, it's just that i'm a freaking geezer and my knees give out after the first band and i can't make it more than two laps in a circle pit. and i'm pretty sure i'm to old to be going to shows like zebrahead.  their crassness is starting to get to me, cos i'm starting to be paying attention to what's going on around me instead of trying to get my ass kicked.  and apparently their lyrics are at the junior high/middle school level.  which i never noticed in college.  scares me that other bands i listened to then might also be juvenile.  i'll just refrain from finding that out about the smoking popes, cos then i'd lose having such a cool band name in my "fan of" list.. hi, i'm a music nerd/loser. it seems that, in all my efforts to become a person who WASN'T a shining example of a christ-like life, i learned how to lie like a psychopath.  funny how you can't just erase some of your morals, and keep the ones that are important.  or only lie to authority figures in your life, and not have it bleed out into every other relationship. and as much as i've tried to at least keep a consistent moral set for myself, post-nihilism-phase, this is where i fail.  and i lie, little lies, to people i don't want to hurt.  or don't want to think badly of me.  and it spirals.  the stakes get doubled, the minute i lie, and i freak, and lie more.  it's so freaking evil.  why anyone puts up with me, i don't know. i've become the devil i wanted to be for so long, just when i stopped wanting it.

       current tune:   onelinedrawing - stay i'm evil. i've spent time away from something really good. i've spent it with something lesser. and i got a painfull reminder of that today. blogger showed me more love than you've ever shown me, LJ. blogger gave me a beta Gmail account. i feel like the first kid with the new toy, but i also feel like a cheater.  so i'm moving my blog (again).

       current tune:   prefuse 73 - One Word Extinguisher. entry most overdue. last weekend i flew out to  urlLink san diego  for yet another wedding.  we flew in and drove up the beach looking for a place to eat.  since we didn't have much time before the wedding, and i hadn't brought three sets of clothes for two days, i wound up sitting on the  urlLink beach , eating gyros, and dressed for a wedding.   that was just the beginning of surreality, tho.  we got to the wedding with .5 minutes to spare, and got rushed to our seats by the father of the bride, and got seated by matt ravenscraft, one of the kids i used to teach in junior high sunday school.  the wedding was really bizarre, since dave's a pastor, and obviously knows the other pastors at the church really well.  so instead of the speech-making being more informal, they were formal, with out-of-place random jokes.  not to mention the completely out of place "christian" misogyny of the first speaker.  all based straight out of scripture, but just put in a completely awkward way that made it even worse.  the second speaker was much more intelligent, but less prepared for formal speechmaking to a friend.  people need to JUST LET GO.  [/random fight club reference] so, much cringing later, we made our way through the receiving line, and dave cried when he saw me and shook my hand.  so very dave.  it's nice to know some people don't change.  but then that's probably pretty similar to what was going through his head when he started making with the leaky eyes. outside we got cornered by the kehlunz(sp?) family who gave appropriately insulated dissapproving looks when i mentioned staying out late, my roommate's drinking habits, or my non-attendance of church in the city. the reception was pretty lame, we hung out with  urlLink jay's  mom, since he was the best man and all.  and somehow she's less appalling than jay himself? i dunno.  it sucked, so right after  urlLink the cake cutting  and the  urlLink the first dance  we bolted for the door. we went back to the hotel and changed, and went for a drive through san diego, just to say we'd been there.  the housing there is super sexy.  the setbacks are really short relative to most of the housing in chicago, and there's a lot more of an adventurous spirit among homeowners there.  but that tends to be true of any single client, rather than developer, though.

        current tune:   further seem forever - pictures of shorelines  last month i stood up at my friend nick's wedding.  mmm, adam in a monkey suit.  it was pretty cool hanging out all weekend with those friends from grade school.  missing the girl was sad, but at least i was able to make it home both nights.    the only thing less than cool was communion.    quick background:  catholics believe that when the priest blesses the bread and wine, that it actually becomes The Body and The Blood, though " urlLink transubstantiation ".  this means that every last drop or crumb is sacred.  if any falls on the floor, it must be picked up, and consumed.  the priest must finish the crumbs, and the wine. (only he gets to drink the wine, since the body contains the blood). abstracted from  urlLink Jonathan Swift's "Tale of a Tub"    since i'm an atheist, and all my friends know, The other groomsman i'd grown up with explained that i could just say "blessing" after my name, and i wouldn't have to partake if i didn't want.  then, whilst waiting for the bridesmaids, nick or one of the other brothers passed down the same info, although with the "telephone game" it's hard to be sure wether i "could" or "should".  Third time, the father of the groom lays a heavy paw on my shoulder and says "WHEN" i get up there i "SHOULD" take a blessing.  Because, you know, an atheist eating christ is far worse than it falling on the floor.  which, incidentally, some did.  Dan and i theorize that papal law actually specifies that the priest should eat what falls, but he just threw it back in with the rest.  We also noted that it might not have happened, had there been altar boys.  We won't suggest why that may have been. I don't know if i should feel some of the heat for making my atheism so widely known, or whether it's purely on the catholics for this essay in bad form.  or whether, since i grew up protestant, and don't believe in transubstantiation (see tale of a tub for more on that) it rubs me wrong.  i don't get upset at other religions that aren't open to non-believers touching holy objects.  It was cool that dan and mike were both taken aback by the awkwardness of it all, tho. it'll be fun to have a proper atheist wedding next month, in opposition to the properly catholic one.
