						   today's post is dedicated to Jon Marcus--- and the ever expanding debate over objective morality we've been having.  I claim that the attempt to prove that objective truth does not exist ends in contradiction because to state that objective truth doesn't exist itself is a contradiction--- in other words Jon is trying to say that it is objectively true that there is no such thing as objective truth.   Jon insists ("congratulations sir," he says in that silly debate voice) that the disproof of the opposite of something doesn't prove its existence. . . this seems silly to me, first year logic teaches you that (x---> a and ~a, therefore ~x)   Doesn't Helen teach you anything, Jon?  but more importantly, that's not really the point-- its not that you cant disprove objective truth that makes objective truth inevitable-- its that you can't utter any intelligable reasons for it.  For example, Jon claims by my own logic, you can't disprove that there is an invisible, intangible rabbit sitting on his head, therefore it must be there.  no Jon, its not the same thing.  I can give you arguments why the rabbit isn't there, arguments like, I can't see it, there's no evidence its there, etc. . . arguments which can be proven true or false, either empirically or logically.  the difference is that to provide reasons why there is no objective truth is to not say anything at all, in the sense that contradictions are meaningless.    we can later argue what those truths may, in fact be, and i don't claim that human beings know or even can know all of them-- although i do believe they are all self-evidently true,  this is an epistomalogical debate-- whether we can know them, not a metaphysical debate-- whether they exist at all.    By the same token of your own arguments, Jon, you claim that all truths are socially constructed.   that truth, itself, must then be socially contstructed, and so there may be some societies which hold their own truths to be true for everyone. . . and since you deny, and must deny, the ability of any society to be able to judge the morals of other societies as true or false, you must deny your own ability to deny the truths of that one objective truth society.  and since you cannot object to it, you must accept it--- you must say then, "it is true for that society that truth is true for everyone"  and so you make yourself accountable to that society's truths, disobeying them or denying them denies your own claim that truth is socially constructed.   I, however, would be able to say that society has correct or incorrect beliefs about truth; I can analyize their tennents in a way you cannot.    suppose that society claims that it is objectivly true, that is true for everyone, that it is morally good to enslave black people.   ( I know i'm setting up a straw man here, but the process by which i'm going to argue can serve to prove my point, not the actual argument)    You are not able to say that that is an immoral society, it is truly their belief that black people are immoral.  But wait there's more.  By not yourself enslaving black people, you are dening their society's rules, even if you don't live in their society--- they hold that it is morally good for people, all people even ones not in their society, to be slavers.  By not following that edict, you are denying their society's beliefs, something you claim you cannot do on any moral level.  You can say that their society isn't ordered well or that its unstable, or any other argument about the practicality or order of slavery, but you can't make any moral argument, to do so appeals to a moral value which can extend beyond cultural or societal limits  I can say that  there is nothing of moral weight that applies to black people which does not also apply to me, the color of their skin can't be the factor-- because i would have to make myself a slave to the next person of lighter skin color to myself. if you prefer, here's Lincoln's fragment on slavery that illustrates my point: You say A.  is white and B.  is black.  It is color, then; the lighter, having the right to enslave the darker?  Take care.  By this rule you are to be slave to the first man you meet, with a fairer skin than your own. 	You do not mean color, exactly?  You mean the whites are intellectually the superior of the blacks, and therefore have the right to enslave them?  Take care again.  By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man you meet with an intellect superior to your own.   	But, you say, it is a question of interest; and if you can make it your interest, you have the right to enslave another.  Very well.  And if he can make it his interest, he has the right to enslave you.  I am able to make this argument because i can claim that principles extend beyond society and exist as logical truths which apply to everyone.

						   top 10 things i figured out that made me feel clever, Mcguyver style:  10) a cigar cutter can, in fact, be used as a pencil sharpener  9)  money can be exchanged for goods and services! (Woo whoo)  8)  Beef is beef, or, more specifically, a hamburger patty can easily become 3 meatballs for spigetti if you ball it up before you cook it  7) A fork can work as a mini crowbar  6) a fork can work as a screwdriver  5) Lamps only work if you plug them in, no matter how many times you change the bulb (even if its 4 times)  4)  "an Evening with the allman brothers" album played loud enough can make the people upstairs stop playing "without me" by eminem over and over  3) 2 carboard boxes can be a nighttable AND a dresser  2) Old school papers can be excellent kindling  1)  the floor is a bad place for your glasses

						   Today's post: the pros and cons of TV  well, its been almost two months since i moved in and i still haven't gotten around to setting up a cable service.  This marks the longest i've ever gone without access to T.V. (i don't count watching the 9000 odd chanels of crapola at Jon's place, especially when Toolie McTool is around.)  Its strange how much the boob tube has invaded our culture-- they're so commonplace, remember that a scant thirty years ago, a color tv was a luxury reserved for the upper midde class and up.   Now its considered by many (especially collegestudents) to be a necessary part of life.    has it changed our lives for the better?  That remains to be seen.  so here's my thoughts on the matter: The need for escapism is a basic part of the human psyche.  some seek drugs, some seek tv, but i think the idea is the same, its a way to pretend, in some small way an for a short period of time, that your life is full of really neat things.  I realize this more than ever. . . having spent hours wtching the same DVDs and Videos over and over (my primary favs. lately have been the new version of DUNE, Lord of the Rings, Vampire Hunter D, and its sequel Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Harry Potter, and the Count of Monte Cristo.)  I think that's healthy to some extent; the ability to imagine other things and better lives forces us to strive to improve our own situation.  BUt at the same time Television is a double edged sword, it also acts as a crutch-- after years of being a dedicated TV watcher, at first i found it difficult to picture anything along those lines without a TV.  My subsequent attempts at creative witing and to some extent this blog is a means of overcomming that imaginative malaise.  I think Dennis Miller summed it up when he said that "by the year 2015, via the means of virtual reality, any man will be able to simulate sex with any woman.  The day that an unemployed construction worker sitting in a barca lounger and a channel flicker in one hand, a forester's in the other can fuck Claudia Schiffer for $19.95 a night, it'll make Crack look like Sanka."  True dat, tv, ike many other forms of escapism can be woefully addictive, and it'll make people soft in many, many different ways (except one, as Prof. Miller points out, he he he)  STill, i do feel somewhat disconnected from the world; i didn't know until today who was in the World Series.  Television can be an amazing source of information, and i do like to keep up to date on current events.  in the end, lke most things, TV is all in the way we use it: Education or Pornography.

						   ok, so I've been hearing so much about the APDA audit thing, and i checked my old email box to find that i hadn't gotten any of the emails. . .  only when i checked my "junk mail" folder did i find where they had gone to  if the quality of these emails is any indication, the junk mail folder is right where my subscription to APDAnet belongs.  the only thing of quality said in any of the plethora of posts clogging my junk mail folder and taking up space on my hotmail email space was by Tim W. when he said that the quality of tournaments has degenerated lately.  Running on-time is a big example.  I remember when the latest run tournament got out at 6pm.  Now its commonplace not to finish until 8 or even later  the banquets were catered events are now pizza or other fast food.  I think y'all should add another -oty award, the Tournament of the Year.  let people compete to be the best, not just compete to see who can run the longest tournament.  I think that extends beyond just tournaments to the quality of debate on APDA.  I may never have been a great debator, but it seems like people now are too interested in winning the round to win the round--- that is, people are too concerned with finding a way to win the round without arguing the issues, arguing "the tactical" as it were.  On gov, this means running cases that snug out any debate that might be controversial, giving yourself the better ground.  On opp this means calling cases tight etc.  Last year's final round at nats should be our exemplar of a fine round.  Although i think it was a bit of a trouncing, my hat's off to NYU for running a wide open case, accepting all arguements, good and bad, that their side might entail.  no caviats, no bullshit, just debate.  That's what APDA used to be.  it is but a poor shadow of what it once was.

						   Hello again, its me. . .  Not much to say, Wex and I are going to see "the Ring" on wednesday--- if you want to come, give me a call.  Its supposed to be a scary movie, except for "signs" i haven't been scared by a movie. . . . Signs was freaky, and it'll be a hard task to top it, but by all accounts, The Ring is really good, so I keep my hopes up.     Oh, yeah, wex tells me there's a way to set up a "reply" thingy on these blogs.  any of you bloggers out there know how to do that, let me know-- that seems like a fun thing to have.  i know the pickings are slim today, but i'm still settling into this blog thing

						   Woe to you, web-traveler, for you have happened upon the rambling and strange world of Jordan Benjamin Gabriel Segal.  Well, I've done it.  I've finally given in and joined Blogworld.  I suppose it was inevitable, but still, i am perpetually intimidated by all things technological, so i held out for a long time.  so, what should i post on my first post?  Well, i think a few words about my self, and what I want this place to be is in order.  WHO AM I? That's a difficult question, for anyone, to answer.  For me, i suppose its a little difficult becaue my life is in. . . shall I say. . . a mild state of disaray.  I just graduated-- thank you, thank you-- from Amherst COllege (Cum Laude, just to tell you I'm pretentious)  and now am trying to join the job market.  Needless to say, that with a degree in Political Science and Philosophy, my skill set is less than marketable, and law school seems pre-ordained, but i need some time to figure out what i actually want to do. Still, i've found a decent gig, working middle management, in a firm that insists that its not a dot-com (if it quacks like a duck. . . )  So what do I do for fun. . . well, again that's a difficult question.  Most of the things that i did . . . ahem. . . recreationally or habitually, seem so. . . college.  i'm trying to become a productive member of society and it seems like many of those things are counter productive to that goal.  So what DO I do for fun?  I play the guitar, trying to get back to the skill level i was at before i put it down almost four years ago now.  Oh, and i've developed a new strange hobby-- writing.  NO, I DON'T MEAN THIS MEANINGLESSNESS but i've actually started writing some silly short stories and such.  I'm never going to publish any of it, but its seems like a healthy outlet for. . .whatever.  I've also been reading a lot, since i don't have cable-- actually i don't even miss cable anymore, except for on sundays and monday nights (GO GIANTS).  I'm living in a single room in Brighton MA, i call the place THE BATCAVE-- its a nice studio in the basement of a condo, but its a cave, nonetheless-- flashback to Invisible Man anyone?  WHY IS THIS PLACE CALLED.THE UNEXAMINED LIFE? the unexamined life, afterall isn't worth living.  Does that mean the Unexamined Life isn't worth reading?   abso-tuting-lutely.  this place is going to be a place for MY thoughts, MY ramblings, and is going to be MY outlet.  YOU have nothing to do with it.  read it, if it pleases you, or don't,  its all the same to me. is that callous? I don't think so, in some way that's what these blogs are all about.  so sit back, visit often, if it makes you happy, if not, i couldn't care less :)   for a little more info about me:      Disorder      Rating        urlLink Paranoid :    Low       urlLink Schizoid :    Moderate       urlLink Schizotypal :    High       urlLink Antisocial :    Moderate       urlLink Borderline :    Low       urlLink Histrionic :    Moderate       urlLink Narcissistic :    Moderate       urlLink Avoidant :    Low       urlLink Dependent :    Low       urlLink Obsessive-Compulsive :    Low       --  urlLink Click Here To Take The Test  --        Schizotypal Many believe that schizotypal personality disorder represents mild schizophrenia. The disorder is characterized by odd forms of thinking and perceiving, and individuals with this disorder often seek isolation from others. They sometimes believe to have extra sensory ability or that unrelated events relate to them in some important way. They generally engage in eccentric behavior and have difficulty concentrating for long periods of time. Their speech is often over elaborate and difficult to follow. (Doesn't this describe most of APDA?)

						   its been a week and a day since my last post, and so much has happened, so here's a table of contents for this post 1) the afternath of the flood 2) job search renewed 3) my anticipation of Harry Potter 2 4) Homecomming at amherst  1) the aftermath of the flood: i have to say that my landlord has been much more forethcomming than i had expected, or could have hoped. he has agreed to pay for any losses, minor though they were, and had a cleaning and painting team already here to shampoo and steam clean the carpet and repaint the walls (they did a great job, you can't even tell there was a leak) and they've promised to pay for my dry cleaning, and for the matress that i needed to replace, and for the food in the fridge i lost.   Jon Marcus keeps trying to get me to up the losses, to tell them that more was damaged, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth to tak advantage of someone going what i preceieve to be above and beyond the call of duty already.  I'm more for letting bygones be and letting alls well that ends well.   also special thanks to P.Nichols and J.Marcus for letting me spend a few nights at their apts while Carlo and Joe (the super and his assist.) worked on my apartmet.  2) so the gig at Netspoke is pissing me off.  they're being really pissy about when i can come in and when i can't.  I've decided to start looking for a better jjob.  more on that as it develops.  3)  Wex and I are going to see HP:and the Chamber of secrets on opening night.   a review of it after the movie is forethcomming.  4) Homecomming.  what a wierd day it was.  the NYT was predicting a williams victory; and since the times decided to do a 2 page spread on div 3 football, i assumed itwould be a major shalackng. . . we won strangely enough.  and all was right in the universe--- we are, after all, a better school than WIlliams, i see our victory over williams in football as sort of an extention of the superiority of wisdom over barbarism. . . haughty, aint I?  but i must say i was a little disappointed in homecomming in general; most of my friends weren't around, although i did get to see a few at Umass, hampshire, smith-- although shame on me for not calling rebecca; that was a mistake, and if you're reading, i appolgize, and i'll get in touch with you next time i go out to amherst-- and MHC.      I didn't get to see albal;she was visiting her bf in vermont, but it was nice to see sophia and it was great to see Louise and Sarah getting along so well after the breakup which albal likens to her own parents breaking up-- indeed, they did seem to be the model of marital stability.  que sera sera i guess, and they both seem to have accepted it as for the best. . . i give up tryingunderstanding women, 1 woman is hard enough to understand, 2 in a single relationship is unfathomable, the way that paraconsistant modal logic is incomprehensible.  . . that is to say, there's a logic there and i have an inkling of it, but only God and Quine could possibly understand it fully, and Quine is dead, so i guess that leaves God.  women are the last great mystery in nature, and i have faith that they will remain as such until the end of time.

						   I HATE WATER:  So, i woke up last night to find about an inch of water on my floor.  a pipe burst on the sixth floor and busted ironized water leaked all over the building.  thankfully, the two BC students who live next door to me were smart enough to turn off the electricity so that no one died of electroshock, and no fires were started. . . let's hear it for Boston College. . . but beyond that all my stuff is wet and broken.  Also, they let me store my consumer electronics in their dry apartment (the leak was right over my appartment so that i bore the brunt of the water damage, lucky me.)    so tomorrow i go to survey the damage, and today i went and bought new clothes so that i could wear some stuff.  also thanks to P.Nichols and Jon Marcus for letting me stay at their places until i could get my shit dry and re-set up.    I hate water, and I hate gravity.

						   Fake birthdays, fake engagements and "she gave us her flower. . . Literally-- get your mind out of the gutter"  so it's been a while, and this post is going to be short, 'cause i'm posting from work on my lunch break.  anyway, things are good; the MIT tournament was hellafun; despite my feelings of "outgrown" APDA, it was good to see the stanford crowd, albeit minus Pat Dempsey.    so after the tournament, Stanford and Yale + Jessee (i guess she counts as Yale now, anyway) and i went ate dinner at Marche' which, is perhaps the most classy cafeteria ever.  anyway, the waiters came in with a birthday cake, and asked if the person whos birthday it was was still there.  Kives yells out, its his birthday, and points to Andrew Korn (not actually his birthday) and they sang happy birthday and we got free cake.  then Kives stands up and announces that Jeff and Beth O'Connor are getting married--- also not true, and we had a celebration about their mock engagement.    after dinner and drinks at Top of the Hub (as per usual stanford) Bolger, Hare, me, Kives, and Jess (stanford novice) went around pestering people on the street pretending to be french tourists--- despite the fact that only Kives could speak french.  One of the people we were pestering happened to be a girl with a rose, and her boyfriend.  Kives kept asking her in french where he could buy a flower for Jess, claiming that it was her birthday--- which it wasn't.  anyway, the girl gave us the rose.    its a little uncool to mess with some dude's date, but still it was funny, and we got some great pictures.    anyway, my job at Goulston and Storrs is a great job-- can't talk much about it, they made me sign a Confedentiality agreement. . .suffice it to say i really enjoy my bosses, 2 women, Beth Cuzzone and Theresa Bomba, they're a lot of fun.  One is the manager of the dept and the other is the director of the dept. . . i'm not really sure what the hierarchy is, but alls i know is they both outrank me-- being at hte bottom of the ladder.  anyway, I really feel like i'm learning a lot-- not as much about "The Law" as i'd hoped, but i'm learning about working in a law firm, and a sizable one at that.  I'm still temp-to-hire at the moment, but i've been working my butt off and i feel that i've got a good shot at getting hired full time-- despite my lack of experience.  Perhaps i should broach the subject with Theresa.  Even if i don't Marc Z. at Today's may have found me another job if/when this one finishes; at an even bigger law firm, more pay, and more benefits for similar work.  perhaps that one will even have nearby parking.  anyway, so i have an interview in the near future (sometime this week most likely)  hopefully i'll be able to finish my job here before i have to start at a new place. . . i hate leaving stuff undone.  also, it turns out I have cable.  yeah, i've been whinning about missing my favorite shows (simpsons, DBZ, and 24) but apparently "all utlitities included" also means cable.   thanks to jon Marcus for figuring it out; although he did break my monitor.  Got a call from Jeremy Basescu, note to self: call him back sometime soon. oh, hey Mr. Russo: if you're reading this, i went out and got a baseball bat yesterday, Mr. Bat say hello to Mr. Kneecap. (j/k i'm just sassing, i don't need the money right away)

						   How to be a whirlwind?  how to be a frenzy?  i'm in a bit of a wierd mood, so today's post will be a little strange.    no online tests today.  no links.  just me talking to the wind.   ok, warnngs done, you chose to keep reading. good.  first of all, it has come to my attention that, despite my best efforts, there are some people who don't like me.  FUCK YOU. you know who you are. I wish you to be raked across the genitals by mining equipment.  that felt good.   ok.  what's next on my mind.  I miss college life.  it was so much easier: no rent, no real problems, except where to find tonight's keg (usually Stone).   new question for you:  is it time for a new layout?

						   The new york times says, " The three dissenters accused the majority of advancing a "homosexual agenda." But their legal analysis relied on the same tired arguments conservatives have long used to deny minority rights. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the three, called the ruling "the invention of a brand-new `constitutional right' by a Court that is impatient of democratic change." It is the same argument made in 1967 for upholding a Virginia law banning marriage between blacks and whites. The idea that minorities must wait for the majority to recognize their basic rights is as wrong today as it was then.  It is too early to say how profound an impact yesterday's decision will have. Gay-rights advocates will no doubt cite it in employment discrimination and gay adoption cases. And no less an authority than Justice Scalia, in his dissent, suggested it may provide a basis for upholding gay marriage. The majority opinion ended by noting the genius of our Constitution: that "persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom."  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, ARE YOU PEOPLE LISTENING. maybe i'll make that the new name of this blog.  ok, calm down.  ok, so before i go into a full fledged Louis Black/Dennis Miller white boy rant perhaps i should respond to the editorial above. but its almost 5pm on friday so i'lll post from home

						   In response to Gavin's plan (posted in my guestbook): Scalia didn't recognize an absolute right to privacy. . . i think you can acknowledge that the framers intended some type of right to privacy without saying that this particular action is protected. . . .   see, for example: a man doesn't have the right to molest a 10 yr old girl, even if its in the privacy of his own bedroom.  It seems the right to privacy IS contingent on the fact that privacy is used for 'good' purposes.    of course, absolutely in no way means that homosexuality is on par with molesting a child.  it is only to say that the right to privacy has HUGE limitations.    again, Scalia's point wasn't that the law shouldn't be struck down, but htat the law shouldn't be struck down BY THE COURT.  I think that's an important distinction.   "scalia's formulation of looking at the right at the most specific level and determining whether it is part of our nation's history and tradition is flawed from the start, if you define the right as homosexual sex, sure there is no history and tradition, and you get an easy out, it takes no account for social change and cultural evolution, and how do you ultimately say the right to own slaves is not fundamental, because by that calculus it clearly could be"  i'm not sure we should take social evolution into account into our court rulings. . . i never did understand the appeal of a "flexible constitution."  doesn't it make more sense to have a rigid constitution that still allows for an amendment process;  note: we did outlaw slavery through an amendment (2 actually: 13 and 14).  As for slavery itself being part of our 'culture' up until the 1860s, i would have said, then, that the courts shouldn't have just willy nilly abolished slavery.    look, there are many shitty laws on the books, but even shitty laws are passed through a democratic process.  You don't have a right to be free from any and all forms of governmental power, but only that when govenrment does exert its authority it does so with your voice counted for. . . i.e. that you have say in government i.e. that you live under a system of consent of the governed.    remember majoritarianism doesn't mean that you'll be in the majority all the time.

						   So my boy, Antonin has been taking a lot of flak lately about the recent dissent in the anti sodomy laws ruling.  But people have to read the ruling more closely.  Scalia's rant against the majority wasn't because he's antihomosexual, but because he thinks that making up new rights and rules that the constitution doesn't protect is NOT within the supreme court's venue--- and he's right about that too; don't think about it as a liberal/conservative difference-- i can imagine liberals inventing, lets say, a right to cultural diversity, which manifests itself in the most abusive form of affirmative action just as easily as i can imagine conservatives inventing a right to beat confessions out of criminals.    of course, that is an extreme on both sides, but it illustrates the point.  Scalia wrote in his decision "The court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed."   To paraphrase Steve Bushemi, look, I'm against the sodomy laws, put up a law which repeals sodomy laws and i'll vote for it, put it in writing and i'll sign it, but what i won't do is play ball.  the point is that as a society we have to make laws through the established means, even if it means that crappy laws which are in effect have to remain in effect for a little longer.  THis american trend of "i hate that law, it must be unconstitutional"  is totally bogus==   think about it this way: the framers of the constitution were bigoted, elitist white bred rich (mostly) slave owning land owners.  what made them worthy of creating our government is that they knew they were bigoted elitist white bred rich slave owning land owners-- and that eventually they would have to allow the poor, non-caucasian masses into mainstream society.  So, they set down a system of rules where laws can be changed.    keeping that system is more important that any individual court ruling or law. . . in  other words sometimes you have to put up with bad laws to ensure that ALL the laws are implemented fairly.  http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=02-102 prove me wrong.

						   So this will probably be my last post until Heidi gets back from maternity leave, so i thought i'd give all you 'peeps' somehting you can use, something i've learned from working in the Student Loan industry,  and as we near the end of grace period for those of you who just graduated, I thought i might give my advice on how to save money on your student loans.  first, and this is the most important piece of advice i can give, and its also stupidly simple:  MAKE SURE YOU FILL OUT ALL THE FORMS.  I can't tell you how many loans i've seen go into default because someone forgot to include a W2, or forgot to sign a check, or something really simple like that.    Even a single missed or late payment can end up costing you a few hundred dollars in interest.  2) investigate your options, especially your repayment options: the standard 10 year/120 month repayment option is the cheapest, in the long run, in that you pay the least ammount of interest.  however, there are a few other plans that, while maybe cost more in the long run, lower your monthly payments: Extended, income sensitive, etc.  . .    3) if you have a problem call your creditor.  most creditors will allow you to make temporary reduced payment arragements, (TRPAs) or Reduced Payment schemes, (RPS).  i guess the best thing to do is keep in touch with your creditor, people tend to just make late payments or miss payments and think that they can get away with it if they duck the creditor calls.  That is just the wrong way of dealing with it.  Most companies will forgive a late or missed payment or two IF YOU LET THEM KNOW.  What companies fear is that the debtor will just disappear and never pay again.  if you keep in touch, they tend to give you more latitude.    In general people don't realize how important repaying student loans are, many people think that its not like a regular loan, which can end up getting your stuff repo-ed. . . they  can't repo your education, after all.  However, loan creditors and insurers have amazing powers to garnish your salary, lien your house and car, even repo cars-- and alter your credit report.  most guys my age don't really think about credit, because we're not buying houses or cars or anything like that, but a lower FICO score from Transunion/Equifax can increase credit card interest rates dramatically.  The better your credit, the more credit card companies 'trust' you and the better your interest rates.    ok, so for what its worth, that's what i've learned so far.

						   THE MIDDLE GROUND, FOR ONCE.  so,  urlLink  Zimmy   starts up with  urlLink  Sepdawg   on the subject of our president's elation on the deaths of Uday and Qusay Hussain. . . .    Zim-- insensitivity is NOT moral bankrupcy. . . Uday and Qusay were bad men, they were true assholes.  Read some bios of them--- they were almost melodramatically evil; the type of bad guys that usually only appears in cheezy made for tv movies.  On the news the other day i saw one of them laugh manically like the Minotaur in "Legend."  they, vlad the impalier style, killed many many people and tortured many more.  killing them was, i believe, not only morally permissable, but morally obligatory.    i think Sepdawg said what needed to be said on the subject of America's inconsistancy, but at the same time, i think Zimmy has some point about the joviality of the subject.  Look, when the state kills at a death penalty-- its not like there's a circus around a public execution-- like the end scene in Braveheart-- its a solemn affair, and i think that's a necessary part of it.  We ought to respect life, even when we take it.    There's a bible story that comes to mind about how when the Jews were escaping from egypt, and the egyptians were drowning in the red sea, a bunch of angels were singing, when god told them to be quiet, because "his creatures were suffering."  I think that's particularly telling--- God did, in the end, kill the bad guys, but at the same time, he didn't have to be happy about it.  Some of the same attitude would be good here too.

						    urlLink  Sep   talks about an interesting article in his post--- which i wish i had a link to, i'd love to read it.  So, without a) sumerizing what Sep already said or b) having read the article Sep discusses,   i'm going to give my opinions on it.  Seems to me that I'm what Sep calls an 'extreme internalist'-- that is i believe that once we answer "what is moral," we have answered "why be moral."-- as i would define 'morality,' as something like "what we ought to do," or "what the good actions are."  but then Susan Wolf's article poses a bit of a problem for me, where she says, as Sep paraphrases, "if you spend every waking hour working for OxFam, you're behaving less-than-admirably; you ought to take up the clarinet or read some Chekhov at least some of the time."  Seems to me that all Susan Wolf has said is that morality doesn't require me to work for oxfam all the time, but that the Good entails some idea of self-betterment.  How could this be?  afterall, isn't self-betterment at the expense of others selfish?  well, depends.  First of all, i would say that I do have some form of right to my own stuff--the stuff that i worked hard for, myself, and earned through my labor-- and that giving up everything to help others isn't morally required.  but more than that, I don't think that Truth (capital T-- the ideal of truth) is just an instrumental good.  Philosophizing and thinking about the world and metaphysics, and other 'lofty' things are good, in and of themselves, not just because they lead to my own personal betterment.  So, i would agree with Susan wolf that we shouldn't always strive for complete and total altruism, but i would disagree that morality=altruism.

						   so While on my coffee break, i thought of 2 more good reasons why its a bad law (see previous post below):  1) it statuorily removes itself from judicial review, any one with any standing to challenge the law-- prisoners-- cannot challenge the law-- they've lost their suit brining ability.  Think about what would happen if congress could do this, they just add the following phrase to the end of the bill "anyone with standing to challenge this law no longer has standing to challenge this law,"  and boom, no more supreme court.  3)this is a bit of a social argument, but the people it disenfranchizes are the people the government has a vested interest in reenfranchizing--- reforming prisoners so that they can be effective members of society, i think, requires that at some point giving them all the abilities-- or, shall i say, privleges and immunities-- of members of that society.  I also noticed, as per the original link Lauren provided, the case has already withstood supreme court.   D'OH. . . i shall have to do additional reading on the matter.

						   so i was reading  urlLink  Lauren's blog   about inmate tort reform, and she points out this law:  urlLink  shitty prison tort law    So, distilled as Lauren Does , the shitty part comes down to this:  "Most notably, there is a "three strikes" provision -- if a prisoner files three claims that are dismissed as frivolous or fail to state claims, that prisoner is barred forever from filing in forma pauperis (as indigent). This means that if a man is sentenced to life in prison and he does not understand the law very well, he could be effectively barred from filing lawsuits within a year or two, if he files claims that get dismissed." ( urlLink  Lauren's blog  )  i didn't believe it until i read the actual text of the law. . . This has got to be unconstitutional--- I know i argue against that word being thrown around a lot, but this time, there's no way this could be allowed under several parts of the constitution but i really don't have enough information to give any of the constitutional arguments, i'll leave that for ( urlLink  the yalians   or for  urlLink  Law schoollers  ) so  note that i'm not going to give the Constitutional arguments, just why this law should be done away with, in general.  first of all, seems like its giving the legislature an awful amount of power over the judicial system. . . .of course many statutes say when you can and cannot sue, but they always allow for very strict criteria, like "you can't sue tobacco companies for smoking," or "you can't sue gun makers for a gun accident" never, "you can never ever sue ever again, if you do X."   true, we do away with many many of inmates rights, forever, after they're incarcerated-- voting for example, but it seems like saying "well, we took away some of their rights, so other rights might be done away with too" leads to prisons turning into slave camps real quick.    Seems to me that with a group which has no right to vote, the right to bring lawsuit should be extra carefully protected.  we never want to have any segment of our population without any legal recourse--- recognize that the final check on government is the right to leave the country, but prisoners don't even have that.    And its not like prisoners rutinely go around making frivilous lawsuits for fun. . . they don't say to themselves, "well, today i'm a little tired of dodging rape by my bunkmate, so i'm going to sue the warden. . .that'll be a nice change of pace."  i would say that prisoners, like most people, sue when they think they have a case.  It really doesn't seem to me that the prisoner lawsuits make up such a substantial portion of lawsuits that we need to bar some prisoners from making them.  if its such a backlog of civil cases, seems like there are soooo many other places to limit law suits (i.e. fast food places, gun makers, cigarette companies, electric companies for dubious 'cancer clusters.' the list goes on.)  by the way, if anyone is reading this and thinking "a-ha, a case" bear in mind that i can think of really NO good arguments to support this law, this would be a tighty tight tight POS case.

						   1st one last message to sepdaw:  I don't actually think you are a closet anticonsequentialist.  Rather i think that all consequentialist theories back themselves into a corner. . .   to say that x is good because it has good consequences is a rule that isn't based on consequentialism. . . .you don't examine the consequences of that rule, you stipulate it (even if you give reasons why it might be true) as an axiom.  Once you grant the existence of moral truths which are true not because of any sort of benefit or consequence, maybe you would assent to other axiomatic truths.  for example: you shouldn't hold people responsible for acts beyond their control.  don't really have to examine each scenario which someone might be held accountable for something beyond his control, its just a truism to say that a free-willed creature is responsible for that which, and only that which, he did, himself.   I don;t have to say "well that rule brings about consequences that i like, or that are generally good."  now my thoughts on the Organ Donation issue: Pat writes: "3. Its a better outcome than the government just requiring people to donate their organs.  It seems like this is a dubious argument.  its also a better outcome than roving bands of chainsaw wielding government agents taking organs at random. (although it would make life interesting) its also better than a lot of other scenarios.  that doesn't necessarily make it the best outcome.  let me be clear-- i do think the other two arguments  urlLink    pat gives are persuasive.  it just seems to me that Pat needs a 3rd independent argument in for the case.    "For some small number of people out there, giving up your organs is a big, big deal. (This is generally the case for religious Jews, and other groups.) Those people don't suffer the disutility of forced donation, while the organ supply is generally increased."  generally people who object to having their organs harvested for religious resons (orthodox jews and the like) also object to having their organs taken out (even defective ones) and new ones put in.  The idea is that they want to die with THEIR organs, the ones they were born with.  Also they might object to the idea that someone else would have to give up an organ for them to have a new organ.    I really think that people who choose not to be in the organ donation system on either end (donation or recipient) don't really factor into the process at all.  Yes, there are a few groups of people who object to being a donor but not to recieving a new organ.  but mostly these people object not out of a religious reason but because they have some viceral aversion to the idea that their organs are going to be harvested. . . once their own life is in danger, self-preservation overrides that aversion.  For people like this, it seems to me that being part of the system is based only on a benefit to them--- I call these people the minimally descent people.  The truely altruistic people will always give to the system, and the truly selfish will always try to free-load off the system.  but i think that most people ask for, and somewhat reasonably so, a quid pro quo from the system.  It seems to me that really any system of incentive to become an organ donar will work for these people,  Recognize that there are very little costs associated with organ donation--- it doesn't cost anything to become an organ donar.  so that's my take on the issue.

						   http://msn.com.com/2100-1104_2-1026795.html?part=msn&subj=ns_1026795&tag=msn_home  WHAT!  and upon re-reading Sepdawg's original post on  urlLink  Sepdawg's blog   , i find my answer. . . while i disagree with sepdawg on this, at least now I know where I stand:  "consequentialism that includes both utility and desert as good consequences -- that seems to involve more arbitrariness than other theories. A utilitarian must perform whatever action maximizes utility -- very simple (at least from a distance). However, it is unclear what I must do. What is the conversion rate of desert to utility? It does not seem like we can provide an answer to that question without being as arbitrary as the guy who says, "742 grains of sand is a heap, but 741 is not". . . .If you're a Kantian, you probably need to distinguish between maxims that refer to acts and maxims that refer to consequences if the Universal Law Formulation of the categorical imperative is to be useful. . . "  not really sure if this is true, but i'll have to think about it for a while

						   NOTE: there has been some confusion. . . my issue with sepdawg has been resolved, this post is moot  Sepdawg posts to Tim's blog:  "Now, Jordan wants to know how I can be a consequentialist and believe in retributivism. After all, when I punish someone without creating utility, what consequence am I maximizing? Well, like any other consequentialist, I'm maximizing "the good". A utilitarian will say that the good is what's good FOR people. I will say that the good is sometimes what's bad for people. . . ."  I think th problem has been that he and I have been operating on two different levels.  What Sep is wondering is if what's good can be (as it often is) bad for someone (see last line of his comment posted above)  but I've been questioning that when he says he's maximizing "the good," its not really clear what that is. . . What i've taken it to mean (if I'm correctly interpreting him) is some sort of hazy general idea of justice, or benefit or something like that.    What I think is that Sep is actually a closet anticonsequentialist. . . when he says he's maximizing 'the good,' he's judging that good to be good on its merits, not on its consequences. Typically (and correct me if i'm wrong on this) a consequentialist says that things are judged to be good based on their consequences-- hence the name-- that, therefore, the good is that which has good consequences.   there are things that are 'good' but don't have good consequences.  Of course, there are actions which have generally beneficial, or beneficial on the aggregate,   Mostly, though it doesn't seem that Sep is arguing that retributivism offers good consequences other than maximizing 'the good.'  what i was asking from Sep, and i believe he might have a good answer for it, but hasn't quite understood my questions yet (granted i've been unclear thus far) is: what are the good consequences of acting on the principle of 'good maximization' (PGM) that justify it as a principle to a consequentialist.    It seems a little circular to say, well I believe in retribution because it maximizes the good which is, in turn, good because to do so maximizes good.  its a little uniformative, wouldn't you say.     Sep will disagree with me on this but i would say the answer is that what Sep is actually doing is offering PGM as a priori, that definitionally the good is that which ought to be maximized.  Once he does that, he grants the existence of moral truths that aren't true in virtue of their consequences.   it seems odd to me to switch back to say that everything else is morally worhty dependent on its consequences.    It seems much easier to me to say that there are things that we can know a priori, without examining the consequences of it. . . for example: Genocide is wrong.  I don't look at each particular attempt a genocide and ask, well, what are the consequences of this genocide?  i know, without any examination that genocide is always wrong.

						   2 things and i'll give each one a post so that it comments can go to either/or: also, check back tonight for my take on the  urlLink organ donation issue   (also check out  urlLink  Patrick's blog  ) 1)  as promised a word or two about imperialism and the united states.  Why is it so bad that America is imperialistic?   People often we're imperialistic in a few ways: first, politically/militarily, we tend to oust leaders and take over countries.  Ok, but that supposes that the people are not better off without us.  We're not crazy military expansionists, hell 9 times out of 10 when we do invade its to STOP a crazy military expansionist.  When we do commit to war its for a reason, one which the people of the United States have to agree with, by and large, or else it doesn't happen.  i'd say that people in-- say Iraq-- are better off under a US led government that respects rights, doesn't gas its own people, etc. (note: we are not doing that, but neither are we creating one that respects rights, doesn't gas its own people etc.)  than under an oppressive authoritative regime.  Ok, yes, we often kill innocent civilians to do so, but again, Sadam killed way way WAY more iragis that sanctions and MOABs combined.    For you Consequentialists/utilitarians out there, think of it this way: we kill 10 people to save 10,000--- and we try as hard as we can to minimize collateral damage, something that Sadam doesn't do.    we're culturally imperialistic.  ok, this one, i just don't buy.  Look, how do we export american culture?  through products and goods and services.  If a foreign country doesn't want to buy american, it doesn't have to.  we just have better stuff than everyone else, that's not cultural imperialism, its cultural superiority.  We didn't steal stuff that we export, we make it.   If china doesn't want to americanize, nobody's holding a gun to its head and saying "open a McDonalds in Beijing"  that was a choice of the CHinese government.    But moreover, why is American Culture so bad?  its a culture which values individualism, freedom, intellectual thought, self-betterment, these are some good stuff.  Let the communist, authoritian, anti-intellectual, murderers get a taste of the good life.  Then what happens?  Glastnost and Peristroika, a Stockmarket in China, and the Pope in Cuba.  lessinging of dictatorial power.  Isn't that a good thing?

						   2) because i'm the type of person who enjoys hitting bee hives with rocks, i'm going to ask this question:  So Chris Russo sent me an email saying, "was looking for something else on the bestbuy.com website, and came across this listing for a computer game....I thought the first "feature" was pretty funny....   Chris   Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader - Windows  Publisher:  Vivendi/Universal  Release Date:   8/14/2003    Overview   Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader takes you back through history to an Earth that might have been. History took an entirely different course and magic has been released upon the world. You'll customize your own character from a myriad of options, solve quests, decipher puzzles and interact with this vibrant world. Move among beasts, wizards, witches and all things magical.  . . .  Features  Experience the Dark Ages as they might have happened  . . . "  so i can Experience the dark ages as they might have happened, eh?  that got me thinking--- is there an alternate world (lewis style) where all this magical stuff happened?  where does Lewis draw the line of "possible worlds?"  logically possible?  that leaves a whole lot of wiggle room and vague boundaries.  Some might claim that things are not possibly other than they are--- someone who believes that the entire world is dominated and controlled by physical laws, etc. therefore there are no other possible worlds.  If you really want to get complicated, what about alternate logically systems which allow for other possibilities-- for example, in classical logic, x-->y is always true if the anticedant is false.  what about a system that is arbitrarily set up such that x--->y is false if the anticedant is false.  boom, did I just create a new set of possible worlds?    Perhaps its all possible worlds given our particular system of logic.  well, what makes our system so great?  that it resembles reality? 1) in many cases it doesn't. 2)it might not in a different reality.  david lewis just gives me a headache.  Saul Kripke for President!

						   WWE Smackdown tonight on UPN:  i love that one legged wrestler.  more seriously, i think its time to waffle on the War in Iraq.  I supported the war, i think Sadam Hussain represented a clear and present danger to the United States regardless whether or not he actually possessed WoMDs-- and i still think he did-- but we've found mass graves, evidence of systematic rape, all sorts of terrible terrible things--- i might add much of which was reminiscent of Nazi Germany.    so the war was justified.  but we have so failed in fighting that war, despite the initial shallacking.  we need a plan about  how to rebuild.  we need a way to prevent our soldiers from being sniped while getting a soda from a soda machine.  the bush administration has screwed up royally, and i think that we need to start taking responsibility.  I used to argue that the justification for the war in iraq was liberation.  but it doesn't seem like we're doing that anymore, now its just occupation for its own sake.  many people would disagree with my initial premise: that the war was justified, saying America was just being imperialistic. . . . words on that to come (say around 12:00).

						   **warning: this is a very poor attempt at explaining what i think is a very interesting issue, but i only had 15 min to write it, so try to give it the benefit of the doubt***  So a recent post on patrick's blog got me thinking about superrogeratory acts--- actions which we would classify as morally good, but not morally obligatory.    conventional wisdom says this type of action does exist, that some things are good, but not required--- charity, for example-- that its morally commendable to give money to the poor, but not obligated.  note: Judith Jarvis Thomson thinks bringing a child to term is such an act-- good but not obligatory-- and that's why abortion is ok. while i am pro-choice, this doesn't seem to be solid grounds for it.  but it still a plausable definition of 'the good' might be that which is morally obligated, and therefore the is no room for superrogatory acts.  Charity, as an example, might be explained by saying either a) Peter Singer Style, we're all immoral people for not going to africa and living like mother theresa or b) there's no obligation to charity and giving money to others is an indifferent thing.  neither seems reasonable.  but perhaps there's a middle ground that can be accepted without accepting superrogatory acts.    I think that charity is a good thing, and some, limited form is obligated, on the principle that helping others in need is good.  but at the same time, i DO have a right to enjoy what i earn-- my money is MY MONEY, that i (here we go john locke) put my labor into.  Therefore to say that i have an obligation to live peter singer style is to say that i have an obligation to be a sort of slave to morality.  that seems contradictory.

						   So i'm not going to post about Tim's entire anti-capitalism rant-- i leave that to patrick. . . .but i do want to comment on one thing he says:  "Capitalism requires that we treat people as mere means to the end of maximizing profit. Kant thinks that this is bad, as do I when I am not in a consequentialist mood. One might find a social structure designed to encourage such dehumanizing behavior unacceptable. . ."  and in a comment response to James, he says:   "Use as a means is fine, it's use as a mere means that Kant/I find(s) problematic. It is fine to pay someone to bake my bread. Is it fine to fire someone who has worked in my bakery for 30 years because a machine can do his job slightly more cheaply?   Capitalism encourages us to go against our intuitions about how people should be treated. One would not naturally want to fire one's loyal employee. An economic system based entirely around the profit motive encourages you not to see your loyal employee asa your loyal employee, but rather simply as entries on a ledger. This seems bad. "  I'm not so sure Kant would see capitalism this way, nor am i so sure this is the way capitalism really works (rahter than the way silly post-modern, post-marxists view it. . . its certainly NOT the way Marx himself thought capitalism works. . .)  First of all, Kant was all about republicanism-- ever read the Perpetual Peace?  he though that the goal of government was to allow for 'the good life,' in Aristotealean terms-- that is government exists as a way of free-willed, rational creatures to exist in a social setting which provides for them to achieve a moral, dutiful, life.  A key part of that has to be the rule of law, which means, roughly, that if a law exists, it is enforced and followed, and fairly created, etc.. .   why do I bring this up? 2 reasons, 1) simply put, "capitalism is the economic form of democracy" (Marx, German Ideology and 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, even in Communist manifesto)  even Marx writes that for contracts to be binding they must be forged between 2 equal parties, otherwise its not a contract so much as one powerful person imposing his will on a weaker person.  So for a contract, as such to be created, it has to be between two people freely entering.  -- how else would one create an economic system where free/rational beings can get along. . . simply put, like in governmental form, capitalism allows every agent to seek his own well being--- not necessarily selfish well being, at that.  I amy be wrong about this, but didn't John Forbes Nash's work on game theory show that the maximum profit is created when all the participants of the game work on enlightened self interest rather then pure, short-term self interest.  and 2) In Tim's example, the employee detrimentally relies on the fact that "i worked here yesterday, i worked here today, and therefore i will work here tomorrow"-- even Tim thinks this is a bad argument, and its not hard to see why.  So long as the employer has the right, given by the contract he signs when he hires the employee, to fire someone because a machine works better, i don't really see a problem.    tthe core problem here isn't that the employer is using his employee as a means, but rather that the principle upon his action is based is selfishness-- a principle which Kant says cannot be universalized.    but similarly to republicanism, where every representative seeks the benefit of only his constitutents and the fair outcome arrives from the negotiation between the representatives, Kant would say that capitalism allows for every individual, seeking their own gain, to negotiate freely with each other to arrive at a fair outcome.    the principle of the system, itself, is to allow free/rational creatures to achieve a fair system, which deosn't mean everyone is equal in wealth per se, but equal in opportunity.  So does capitalism cause people to use each other as means to the end of profit, rather than ends themselves?  not really, people do pay fair wages in exchange for modes of production fairly contracted for.  that's not using someone as a means to an end--- quite the opposite, I think it somehow validates the employee--- it says that this is a creature that is able to engage in contractual bargaining, something that only free/rational beings can do.     to be fair, I don't think that pure capitalism gives that, but instead requires some forms of governmental intervention--- but that's a far cry away from what Tim seems to be arguing for--- also, be aware that this is the way Marx saw capitalism too; his problem was that the act of contracting separated a person from his mode of production, and that it created boundaries between people, boundaries that Kant saw as necessary for free/rational beings.  So Tim isn't being a good communist in his post, he's becoming a silly american-socialist.   Therefore, Tim, you are becoming more Pink than your Lucky Shirt.

						   to  urlLink  Tim   makes a quick, but interesting comment about compatibilism;  for those out of the philosophical loop, its the view that free will and determinism are not mutually exclusive.    People who have seen the matrix may rail against this view, but i've always thought that it had some merit.  Now Tim makes part of the argument for me when he says that both free will and determinism need clarification.  how can these beliefs be nonmutually exclusive?  well, what is free will?  I don't really accept the definition that a choice is when things might have been otherwise except for my choice.  For example, Let's take Demi McDemocrat.  Demi is a party line democrat, will only vote for democrats, and will only support Democrat platform issues.  in the next election, she clearly CAN chose to vote republican, as in, she has the ability to do so, in an alternate (sorry Tim) universe, she might have voted for the republican (if, in Kripean style, identity flows across modal realities. . .eer possiblilites, or whatever you want to call them)  but in this-- the G reality-- I can predict with absolute certainty that she will vote for a democrat.    A determinist might say that in this reality, jordan has defined Demi such that she will do so, and, similar to reality, the sum total of her identity forces her to vote in such a way.  and, in reality, a determinist might say, that's how free will actually works:  our identies, who we are, determines what we chose, and then, a stricter determinst might continue, we can see what causes those identies--- laws of physics, genetics, and biochemistry, whathave you.   So, how to compatibalize these two views?  well, i remember reading an article in my Metaphysics 101 class that had an interesting viewpoint-- i forget who wrote it, but they said that free will is when Second Order Volitions determine first order volitions-- that is to say, what i actually choose is irrelevant.  A second order volition is a desire to be the type of person who desires X--- so if i have a second order volition to be law abiding, i want to be the type of person who wants to obey the law.  the first order volition is wanting to obey the law.     Free will, then, is when my second order volitions can lead to my first order volitions--- so if my wanting to be a law abiding type can lead to my actually being law abiding.  notice that a determinist might say that second order volitions are just as suceptible to physics, genetics and biochemistry.  but at this point it no longer matters--- the idea is that free will is created by second order volitions ruling first order volitions.  Also notice that this can be easily turned into a more Kantian vision of free will--- men are free willed because we can act upon our principles (although there is an important distinction between principles and second order volitions).  A few more notes on compatiblism: 1) perhaps this leaves room for my favorite topic (which i posted about a few days ago) the mystic/rational distinction--- in so far as we are free willed, rational creatures, we have choice, but there is an important way in which we are fated, or determined, to act in certain ways.  God at work?  that opens a whole new can of worms.  2) i'm not really sure if this compatiblism actually works.  It seems to me that there needs to be a whole lot more clarification of why choice is actually the link between first and second order volitions, rather than just an ability to do either/or of 2 different actions, although it seems like it might be a reasonable approximation of the same thing.    i also really enjoyed  urlLink  Lauren's most recent post about law, justice, et. al   but i hesitate to post on it, since she quarterfinals at stanford shalacked me and nick with a case that used much of the same logic.

						   So a few posts down, you'll see my review of a book called the Dancing Wu Li Masters; and i've been thinking the rationalist/mystic distinction for a while, and i thought i'd post some thoughts on the matter; but not now, because i'm almost out of my 15 min. (break times: 10:00a-10:15a, 12:00-12:30p, 3:00p-3:15p)  Harris is playing at the Middle East on saturday at 9:15pm. . . with some luck i'll get to see them play.  a few congratulations are in order: 1) Congratulations to Storey and Emily, I wish you two all the best in the world. 2) Congratulations to Heidi, good luck with the new baby-- see you in a month 3) Congratulations to Josh on his promotion.

						   So i don't have P.Larochelle's email address, so i'm send you a note here. . .  I noticed you were reading "the Danicing WuLi Masters," by Zukov, which i think is one of the best books ever written-- and i'm going to tell you why i think so, in very very general terms.  First of all, i liked it because it was written in layman's terms. . . . i am not, nor have i ever been, a science person, and sometimes theoretical science, which i do find interesting is beyond me because i don't have a firm enough grasp of hte basics.  so often i talk about theoretical science as a metaphysician would--- that is, say how things might be about time travel, or the a priority of space-time, but when comes to hard core science theory, i'm a bit inept.    second, the take on Science that WuLi masters takes is really REALLY interesting, and here's what i find really great about it. . .  the idea he proposes, in simpliest terms, is that the really great scientists are able to grasp the theory not necessarily by comming up with new and different equations, but by sort of intuiting (he calls it dancing) what the right answers are, and seeing the beauty of each equation, and then proving it scientifically.--- sort of an almost gnostic way of thinking that I think our 21st century scienctific hyper-technology minds have forgotten about.    I think that's one of the hardest philosophical questions to ask---  put in more traditionally philosophical terms; i am a rationalist, i believe in absolute truths that are accessable by reason (yes, heisenberg, not all of them, but the big important philosophical ones are) and all that, but there seems to be something appealing about sort of a mystical view of the universe-- that there are things beyond knowledge that can be important and relevent to our lives.     and those are two very difficult ideas to reconcille, and i think WuLi brings together both the mystic and the rational in a very adept way.  I don't know how much you've read in it, but i liked it. . .  hopefully, this may be the first thing i've ever posted that you agree with.   ok.  enough with the book report.

						   So i came home today and checked my personal email to find an email from (anonymous sitemaster) who asked me to link his site, in exchange for me linking his.   At first, i got mad.  what a waste of time then i got scared.  how did this wako find my site? then i had an epiphany:  so i replied with the following:  Dear Sir.  what you may not know is that my site commercially links weblogs.  I will be more than happy to link your site, however, I would ask my standard fees of $.05 per referral.  I will also ask that you add on a script which clearly and publically states the number of referrals.  I look foreward to doing business with you. yours,   no reply as of yet, who knows i may have a new business.

						    urlLink  Adam's blog   has a neat little rant about God, one of my favorite subjects-- and appropriately i'm wearing the shirt from St Joseph's Seminary that i stole from my dad-- so i thought i'd post a few words about it; i've already posted much in my comments to  urlLink Tim  and i had a good conversation on this very topic with Nikki on her way back to Waltham the other day, so i may be repeating my self a bit, but nonetheless, i think it bears repeating.  1) I think adam's blog is mostly a critique of organized religion, religion as such, as opposed to spirituality.  And, for the most part, i agree.  I suppose organized religion serves some sort of instrumental good-- teaching values, community, etc. -- but for the most part it has, historically, only impeded a personal relationship with god, on many different levels.  I suppose the real Segal to ask on this matter is my father, but since he doesn't yet have his own blog, perhaps he'll comment on the subject in my comments page.   2) in so far as (AAAH DEBATE SPEAK!!) Unikhous is attacking the very concept of God, i think he's missed the ball.    On a positive proof for god, i firmly believe in the Teleological-- that is to say that human beings seem to be advancing forward, which implies we are moving towards SOMETHING (not hard evidence, i know, but it seems reasonable to me).  but more than that, so much of what we do subtley assumes a deity of some sort (see my comments on Tim's blog), or for a more detailed critique see Simone Veil's "Putting Torah before God"  At the core, both belief and disbelief in god is a leap of faith-- since there is no way of knowing with absolute certainty either way.  I think that God, if he does exist as a sentient judging being, would not care about some insignificant little human's belief system so long as he acts correctly about "the big things" i.e. doesn't murder, etc.

						   In response to  urlLink   Maureen Dowd's most recent OP-ED piece:   1) Wile E Coyote WAS NOT a "distracted doggie."  i would say he was a) rather focused on one thing, and b)quite ingenious.  -- could someone with AADD build an acme catapult that defies the laws of physics to flip completely over rather than launch the thing it was supposed to?   but lets get to the nitty gritty of her op-ed:  "I find my mind wandering from tasks that are uninteresting or difficult." (Like nation building, which we said we'd never do but are muddling through now, with no coherent strategy, in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East, and soon in Liberia.) "  --No question we've been underplaying the state building, but can you blame W?  his biggest supporters, the far right, are habitual isolationists, worried that we'll get involved with statescrafting in far away lands.  Look, we said that we were there to stop the dictator, we did that.  If we were building a fair and free democratic state, all you party-line dems would be whining, "look how we're imposing our values on them, weh weh"  "I say things without thinking and later regret having said them." (Such as declaring we have "prevailed" in Iraq two months before the commander there admits, "We're still at war." Or bubbling about the statue of Saddam falling and then months later posting a $25 million bounty on the real Saddam's head. Or saying Saddam had W.M.D.'s that posed an imminent threat to us and then failing to find a single warhead. Or saying we'd already found the weapons when all we'd found was some trashed trailer. Or saying we'd get Osama "dead or alive" and Al Qaeda was "on the run.") "  -- Did I hear you right, Maureen, we haven't prevailed in Iraq?  what?  are you kidding me?  yes, there's some residual resistance, but that's always ALWAYS the case.  Did you know that every few years some whitehaired japanese guy stumbles out of some south pacific island and says, "ok, World War Two is over for me now, i give up."  WWII-- and that was over 50 years ago.  just because some small pockets of resistence still go on fighting, doesn't mean the regime is crumbled-- which, i might add, was our primary mission in iraq.  I've already posted enough on WoMDs (which i still think they had)  as for Al Qaeda,  they're definately on the ropes right now, and while they may not be quite TKOed, they've still woken the sleeping tiger.  "I make quick decisions without thinking enough about their possible bad results." (Such as how our troops will be targets in hostile, dangerous territory, stuck there for years sorting out tribal and sectarian warfare.) "  Years, really?  Seems to me that we could hand the whole state building over to the UN like we said we were going to, and like the UN wants, and problem solved.  "I have a quick temper, a short fuse." (Like the president, taunting the Iraqi militants, saying, "Bring 'em on." Shouldn't that sort of trash talking be reserved for football and Schwarzenegger sequels?"  I see, so these people who have already declared Jihad on us are going to say, "oooo i didn't mind them so much before, but he said bring it on, so i hate those pesky americans now." when dealing with terrorists, perception is key, a bit of bravado can go a long way.  "I have trouble planning in what order to do a series of tasks or activities." (Such as threatening to rumble with North Korea and Iran while we're still prone to stumble in Afghanistan and Iraq.)   For god's sake Maureen, the North Koreans aren't going to call a time out because we're involved in Iraq.  "In group activities it is hard for me to wait my turn." (Why wait for the pansy allies, even if you'll need their help after?) "  Why should we wait for our pansy allies?  wasn't it our quick response to 9/11 that prevented the Taliban from entrenching and preparing for the onslaught?  or our "shock and Awe" campaign that made more than 1/2 the Iraqi regular army surrender?  why wait on froggys when you can be a hawk all by yourself (well, maybe a little help from the brits)  "I usually work on more than one project at a time, and fail to finish many of them." (Yes. Al Qaeda is recrudescing. In Afghanistan, the Taliban is coming back, warlords rule and the vice and virtue police are at it again. Iran and North Korea are defying us. Saddam is still lurking, even as we struggle in Iraq to get the lights on, the oil industry up and the violence down. We say everything is O.K. while the senators who went to Iraq last week say we're stretched thin in the face of more and more attacks by Saddam loyalists. "  yup, the world's still a dangerous place. does that mean we're doing the wrong thing?  "Yep. These guys definitely have E.A.D.D.  Empire Attention Deficit Disorder. "  maybe you're just an idiot, Maureen Dowd  look, i don't like W any more than you do, but let's critize him for the things he's doing WRONG.  oh, and as far as Sass goes, you're still a rank amature.

						   Phil quoted some pinko commie twinkle toed bint on his site as saying:  "When you enter the low-wage workplace -- and many of the medium-wage workplaces as well -- you check your civil liberties at the door, leave America and all it supposedly stands for behind, and learn to zip your lips for the duration of the shift. The consequences of this routine surreunder go beyond the issues of wage and poverty. We can hardly pride ourselves on being the world's preeminent democracy, after all, if large numbers of citizens spend half their waking hours in what amounts, in plain terms, to a dictatorship."  this made me mad--- there is a significant difference between a dictatorship and living in shitty circumstances.  It sucks to be in a low wage job where conditions probably suck.  its shitty.  I feel sorry for people for whom the choice is one of these jobs or no job at all.    BUT ITS NOT THE SAME AS A DICTATORSHIP!  a dictatorship is where THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONTROL OVER WHERE YOU WORK, LIVE, EAT, SLEEP, ETC.  Look, just because some people's lives would suck MORE if they quit their jobs, doesn't mean they are forced, in the dictatorial sense, into that job.  I honestly don't think people have a right to happiness; they have a right to THE PURSUIT thereof.  they always have the right to quit their job to find better work, to go to vocational school, to do many many different things to avoid working in terrible circumstances.    Should we have better enforcement of work place condition rules, yes.  but just because someone doesn't like their job and feels like they are forced to work there under pain of welfare, doesn't mean its a dictatorship.  and while i'm on the subject of stupid quotes, "Stephen Baker, director of industry analysis at the NPD Group, attributed the surge in sales of laptop computers to a greater interest in being able to transport a personal computer." according to an AP story on laptop sales exceeding desktop for the first time.  well No Shit.  That's some deep market analysis.  Think about it-- interest in tranporting a computer would lead to more laptop sales. . . wow.  I think some similar analysis would go something like this: " attribute the surge of sales in pens to interest in writing stuff down." or perhaps "i attribute the surge of sales in laxatives to the interest in remaining regular."  in its purest form, "I attribute sales of X to interest in 'the very thing X was designed to do'"  if this is the quality of analysis from the average market anaylsis person, no wonder our country's economy is in the shitter.

						   Another great OP-Ed by William Safire: http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/07/opinion/07SAFI.html  Also, it turns out that Bush can do something right, after all--- the AIDS drugs plan to Africa is a great move, a humitarian package that even the dems have shunned.   .  .   I'm sure you guys who went to Stollenbosh will attest that AIDS is rampant in africa, and the economic costs to american pharm Cos. is small, albeit non-negligable.    and Africa seems to me to be the Continent that American Humanitarianism forgot.  its not that we don't care, its just that Africa isn't in our Sphere of Influence/interests.    however, with oil prices rising and the middle east an anti-american sentiment zone, it seems that Africa has started to become a potential american interest.  first step: more humanitarian aid second step: support democratic reforms in many of the really really bad areas (Nigeria, Zaire, and-- dare I say it-- Rwanda).  People say this Humanitarian aid-but-only-for-those-who-have-stuff-we-want doctrine is cold, but look, we only have so much to go around.  we have to prioritize, so it seems to me the best way to prioritize is to give aid to those who can give back to us, that way we have more to give in the long run. . .   aid isn't necessarily charity-- its not exactly clear to me that every nation, particularly african nations, woudl accept charity.   but that's in the future.  For right now, a 'goodwill' gesture of AIDS relief seems the right, politically and morally, thing to do.  so way to go POTUS GWB, even the sun shines on a dog's ass some days.

						   WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE LACKING PART 2.  i'm on my way back from the cape so i'll finish up this post (by the way, had a great time).    But as I was saying: Look, an American Empire is only a bad thing if the people of foreign countries are better off under the rule of oppressive military dicatatorships. . .   what we need is a leader to step up to the plate and say to the world:  hey, look, we're richer than you, more powerful than you, and can kick your ass, We'll leave you alone if you stop acting like assholes, but if you start some shit, we'll take you out back of the United Nations and Kick the Crap out of you, MOAB style. got that?  Oh, and if you're thinking of going terrorist, don't, we've got your telephones bugged and we'll shoot your suicide troops before they get near our soil.  Ya Got that, ya primative screwballs?    The biggest advantage the terrorists have (and perhaps their only advantage) is their faith.  They believe so firmly in their cause they're willing to die for it.  Misguided though they may be, they think they're right-- and no one, not even the barrell of a gun will tell them otherwise.  That's part of what I think america has lost.  DUring WWII, we belived in what we were fighting for, that Democracy was Superior to Fascism.  but a cold war, korea, and vietnam later, america isn't so sure of itself anymore.   That's going to have to change if America's going to remain the worlds superpower for much longer.

						   WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE LACKING:  So after posting on Muxalicious-- about how America used to be a City on a Hill, and making some silly comments about immigration-- sarcastic stuff mostly-- but there's something there;  not about immigration, Pat's right about that, immigrants tend to be very producive members of society, hard working, law abiding, etc. . . but about how America seems to have lost something.  My old mentor Prof. Arkes would probably say that America has lost its sense of morality in law-- that the positivists and post-modernists have taken over the intelligencia and begun to undercut the premises of the American Founding that made us great in the first place.  THat's definately part of it.  Our politicians have stopped appealing to right and wrong as much as our interests vs their interests. Think about the recent Gulf War, the sequel. Many americans are screaming that we haven't found any WoMDs, or any solid evidence that Iraq was building a WoMD program.  What we have found is a series of mass graves and more and more evidence that Sadam Hussain was more oppressive and destructive than we had ever thought.   Apparently, that's not enough to justify interention.  We needed to use that as our justification before we started the war in order for that to be 'admissible' in people's minds.  Does it?  Does it really?  let's say that police search a guys house (on a ligitimate search warrent) looking for drugs.  They find, instead a dead body with tons of evidence on it, but no drugs anywhere.  the guy is then put in jail.   We wouldn't, or at least shouldn't, argue that because we weren't looking for the body, it shouldn't be admissible, just because we didn't suspect him of that crime.  -- if Julian's reading this, he'll probably post a response that'll wreck my reasoning, but if he does, he'll still part of the point.    THe point isn't that we're still acting ok because Sadam deserved getting bombed-- well that is part of it, and he did deserve what he got-- but why DIDN'T we use that as our reasoning?    well, there may be several reasons. 1) that we didn't know about it. I find this highly dubious.  with our intelligence capability, it seems to me that we probably noticed the wholesale slaughter of a large segment of population in one of our biggest rivals for regional power.  2) that we knew about it and were supporting Sadam at the time, thus making it an embarassment to play-up the massacres: this is specious reasoning.  first off, we were supporting them against the Communists, which, at the time was a much greater threat.-- you have to pick your priorities sometimes.  Secondly, even if we were more than friends of convience, its possible that we didn't know about the crimes against humanity then, our attention was kind of elsewhere; also most of the time we Finlandized countries during the cold war, giving them domestic autonomy in exchange for support for our foreign relations plans.  Third, the world fucking changes!  Sparta and Athens were friends during the Pelopanesian war, but ended up killing each other-- When half the global power structure crumbles, alliances need to be reevaluated, pacts are reforged.  3) The American populace wouldn't accept this as a valid reason for interention. I think this is most likely.  Ever since Vietnam, The American Government has been really careful to use American Interests as the reason for foreign intervention--- the First Gulf war was Oil interests, Kosovo was Stability of Europe, and this time it was WoMDs and Terrorism.  Why is that?  we're ambivilent to dictators who, hitler style, gas  their own citizens -- a sort of "oh, what a fucking shame, but what am I supposed to do about it" attitude.  But make the case that we're in danger and LOOK OUT.    Not to say, of course that we shouldn't defned ourselves when we're in danger from a foreign country.  but why can't we act to take down a dictator.  At its core, I think the reson for this is that our enemies have becore more badass than us.  true true we can bomb just about anyone in the world, and we have the most impressive military force ever assembled on this planet.  But our strength is useless if we don't have the balls to use it.    (i realize i'm close to making the same mistake Bill Mahr made, but i will walk this fine line with grace. hopefully)  I guess its not a question of courage--- I agree with Lockes that Courage requires some understanding of what your fighting for.  But while our enemies have enough faith in ideals-- misguided though they may be-- to strap dynamite to themselves, we sit around with our wishy-washy psudo intellectual way of analyzing and say, "well, are we really right?"  "do we really deserve to be the worlds greatest superpower?"  "what makes our ideals so right?" and my personal favorite, "we have to respect their culture."    WHY DO WE HAVE TO RESPECT THEIR CULTURE?  is it a culture worth our respect-- that's the real question.  its a culture that says that if you can't defeat your opponent on the battlefield, its OK to kill their children.  What's so respect worthy there?  Obviously i'm not talking about the average Muslim who probably wants nothing more than live his life but happened to be born into an oppresive military dictatorship.    I guess my core problem is when people say that America is being Imperialist.  I just don't see what's so bad about that.    but i'm almost in Mashpee so i'll say To Be Continued on this post. . .   by the way, As per Julian's blog, i took "who should I vote for" test: Your Results:  1.

						     Yesterday, after work, i was walking to the T Stop and who should I run into, stranded in boston, but Nikki-- and, because i'm a great guy, i gave her a ride home to waltham-- giving up my much-prized street parking spot.  But, typical to form for me, i got superlost on the way home--- it took me until 8pm to find my way through watertown back to brighton.    But Miraculously, no one had parked in the spot, so i was able to squeeze my way back into the same place it was before.   It definately was a small miracle.  In honor of the 4th of July, I think I'll post some quotes from famous Americans:  I'm very critical of the U.S., but get me outside the country and all of a sudden I can't bring myself to say one nasty thing about the U.S. --Saul Alinsky  Anybody who wants the presidency so much that he'll spend two years organizing and campaigning for it is not to be trusted with the office. --David Broder  Any man under 30 who is not a liberal has no heart, and any man over 30 who is not a conservative has no brains. --Winston Churchill (made an American CItizen by special act of congress)  They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.  --Benjamin Franklin   Under capitalism, man exploits man. Under communism, it's just the opposite.  --John Kenneth Galbraith  The right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins.  --Oliver Wendell Holmes  And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.  --John F. Kennedy (inaugural speech, 1961)  If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.  --John F.

						   So as the first of many changes and updates i am making to this blog, I have decided to announce the creation of a new institute.  You've heard of the SETI-- the search for extra terrestrial Intelligence, well, this is STI-- the Search for Terrestrial Intelligence.    The Idea behind STI is to find truly new and innovative ideas; things that aren't combinations or extractions from other ideas--- perhaps a conclusion based on 3 independent points --    think about it.  What was your last great idea?  when was the last time you thought of something that revolutionized the way you saw the world?  when was the last time you subverted your own dominant paradigm?    The ideas we've heard lately, from scientists, from philosophers, and most importantly, from politicians have all been, at best, mediocore, and, at worse, outright stupidity.  So I am now donating my entire fortune (small, though it may be) to the Search for Terrestrial Intelligence.  Donations Accepted.

						   So i get this free day of paid vacation on friday, for indepenence day (ID4).  but i was thinking, isn't it better to get a day off on friday than on mondy?  if there's a day off on friday, you have something to look forward to all week.  with a day off on monday, you spend the rest of the week kicking yourself for not using hte extra day more effectively.   its a classic problem of anticipation vs. regret.

						   one final word on gay rights and Justice Scalia. . . . by Storey Clayton, because he said it, just so damn better than I did: --By far the most important Supreme Court decision of all the myriad ones coming out this week is the repeal of sodomy laws.  Finally we're taking an actual step toward gay rights!  However, I think that the reasoning used by the Court, as always, is arcane at best.  Whether or not you believe the Constitution stipulates a right to privacy, I think the very idea of one (the way it's being interpreted) is absurd.  Everyone's summarizing this ruling with the general idea of "we don't want government in the bedroom".  Oh really?  What if there's rape in the bedroom?  Or child molestation?  Or child pornography?  The basic logic of this ruling is that sodomy might be reasonable to be considered a crime, but it's too private to deal with.  This is a very bad way of opening up gay rights doors.  Why not try the approach of saying "This never ever should have been criminalized in the first place, is a fine activity, & has nothing to do with privacy one way or the other"?  The way people weasel out of this is with the general standard of "consenting adults".  & that's a fine standard, but that has nothing at all to do with a privacy right, really, does it?  Because it has to be public enough for people to be able to verify consent & adulthood.  & even that standard legalizes prostitution, which doesn't seem like a good idea either.  It's a big quagmire, this nebulous privacy idea... I just don't think that there's any expectation for acts to really be considered private before the law, because the law has to determine whether a crime was committed in any situation, opening it up to at least somewhat public scrutiny.  Ultimately, we really need to sit down & say that homosexual sex is okay in our society, & that doesn't have anything to do with anything else, not animals or kids, or anything.  It just has to do with that one thing, & it's okay, not because it's private, but because it's okay.  Plain & simple.   Way to go, Storey, now if we could just get you to join a meat-eating fight club, you'd be all set.

						     THE SLEEPER HAS AWAKENED     1) my dad just finished his work on the new movie about the Gospel of John (not the Mel Gibson one, but a competing one to be released at just about the same time. here's a press release about it :   urlLink  link    2) it got me thinking about a few posts ago, Unikowsky and I had a bit of a throwdown over the topic of religion.  Whereas he maintains that its a "festering scab," I still say that religion is, in general, a good thing.  Of course, it can, like any other dogmatic, gnostic, or relavatory ideology can be perverted by people for power (this is, actually, my father's take on it-- read his new book to be comming out soon, also read it so that he can pay for my law school education.)  and NYtimes columnist Herbert (it might have been Krugman, i forget.) wrote that he finds it odd that something like 48% of americans believe that God is necessary for a system of morality, whereas something like 25% of nonamericans around the world have that belief.    I tend to agree that God isn't necessary for morality, itself, although some belief in divinty does seem, to me, to be necessary for many of our most fundamental meta-moral questions.    I, like most good Kantians, believe that morality, itself, is based on 2 axiomatic truths about human nature: 1) man is free willed, and 2) man is rational.  the denial of either of these inevitably leads to contradiction--- try to give me reasons that you are not rational, that seems self-defeating.  and try to give me reasons that you are not free-willed.  again, you end up defeating your own purpose, because without free will you're not really giving me reasons as much as saying what you are programed to say-- no real argument is possible in either case.    and based on that, we can construct moral views about how to act, etc.  But it does not answer "why be moral."  Before  urlLink  you   get all consequentialist on me, remember that neither can consequentialism.  or utilitariansm, or hedonism, or any moral system.  You can always ask, "why should I maximize utility?" or "why should I want to maximize my own pleasure?" point is that regardless of your views on what morality is, there is a primary question about what the impetus for morality is.  think about trying to explain morality to a child who constantly asks "why?" to every answer you give.  In the end you either have to admit ignorance or just say, "BECAUSE, DAMMIT!"  Its a childish (forgive the pun) example but it illustrates what i think is a core problem of morality.  A few different philosophers have answered this (or at least attempted to). . . Kant said that we have no choice-- rational beings that we are, we must behave in a rational way. and here He and I split--- it seems that humans aren't always rational; and we can see, many people acting irrationally qua terrorism, or qua strong emotions, or even qua art.  while i agree that man is a rational creature, that doesn't mean he's a   perfectly   rational creature.    Socrates (and Plato) argued in "the Ring of Gyges" section of the Republic that you want to be moral because morality gives you happiness-- a sort of real happiness that material possessions doesn't give you.  this seems lacking, for obvious reasons.   Hobbes also said that we have no choice but to be moral, but he based his moral system on self-interest-- saying that man cannot do but what is in his self-interest.  This too, seems lacking  finally, and the one I find most interesting, is Neitzche, who argued that man should strive for a will-based ethos, rather than a thought based-ethos, and Kierkagaard (sp?)  who talked about moving beyond the aesthetic and teleological to the post-teleological (see Fear and Trembling).  of course, the problem with this is that its extremely vague-- not just because i explained it in 2 sentances, but because it actually is quite vague.   but, my coffee break is over, so check back around 12:30 for more on this

						   according to the  urlLink  Are you a neocon   quiz provided by Amy,    Based on your answers, you are most likely a realist.   Realist  Realists  Are guided more by practical considerations than ideological vision  Believe US power is crucial to successful diplomacy - and vice versa  Don't want US policy options unduly limited by world opinion or ethical considerations  Believe strong alliances are important to US interests  Weigh the political costs of foreign action  Believe foreign intervention must be dictated by compelling national interest  Historical realist: President Dwight D. Eisenhower  Modern realist: Secretary of State Colin Powell  and that's not all that far off--- perhaps i'm a liberal leaning realist, but its not terrible for a test with 4 possible outcomes: Liberal, Conservative, Realist, and Isolationist.  i think that its sort of wierd that whoever made this test finds all four to be indepent of each other, where as i sort of see three different axes: liberal/conservative and internationalist/isolationist.  and realist/idealist.

						   As Posted below, POrn star Mary Carey is running for california  urlLink  Governor  .  Her proposals are amazingly intelligent.  click the link to read about them. . . here's my take on a few of them:  2. Tax breast implants. From Beverly Hills alone, we should bring in millions in tax revenue. (Note: I am all-natural and I personally discourage the use of implants!)   (all natural?  a flat out, boldfaced lie.  she's becoming more of a politician every day.)   3. Make lap dances a tax deductible business expense. This will help grease the wheels of business in California and stimulate our economy.   ("grease the wheels?" sure, with body oil. "stimulate our economy" wasn't meant like that!)  4. If Im elected Governor, I will wire the Governors Mansion with live web cams in every room. We will create a pay site, and all money collected will go toward reducing the deficit. Californians will get to see their government in action - literally! (Also, we will have people from around the globe helping to pay off our debt, so it doesnt all fall on the shoulders of Californians.)  (Why didn't Clinton do this with the Lincoln bedroom?)  5. I will create a Porn for Pistols program to take handguns off the streets. Dealing with the violence and injuries associated with handguns is a huge drain on our state's resources.  (the problem with this is that 9/10ths of the people who have the handguns in California, esp. L.A., are too young to buy porn-- what a perverse incentive, under 18? get a gun, get free porn.)  6. As Governor, I will recruit fellow performers from the adult video industry as ambassadors of good will. These ambassadors will be a great help to California when it comes to such things as negotiating rates for buying electricity from neighboring states.  (porn Ambassadors?  whatever will happen to Holbrook?)

						   Ahhh, the immigration debate will never die.  HAHAHAHA IT IS IMMORTAL!  anyway,  urlLink  Eunich house   chimes in with storey clayton.   so a few thoughts on his post. 1)  urlLink  Big Daddy P.   points out the inconsistancy of this with Adam's views on isreal.  I don't really know adam's views on the holy land, but i'd be itnerested to hear them, and why they are/are not inconsistent w/ his views on immigration.  personally I agree with 'the right of return,' and that certain contries have the right to create a religious state-- provided, of course, that they don't preclude people from practicing other religions or persecute them for doing so.  (see the way Brussel's runs things for more on that.)  It seems perfectly legitimate to me for a Jewish Homeland to state that Jews have an automatic right to be a citizen while others need to petition.  but enough on that till i hear some more substance from other people involved.  2) Adam says, "I believe that every random dude in North Dakota and Iowa has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, not because this should be a right guaranteed to all Americans (I'm not even an American), but because it should be a right guaranteed to all people. It's not like an American thrown in prison without a trial is having his rights violated any more than a Kazakhstani thrown in prison without a trial. There is really no particular moral relevance to the geographical location in which someone was born. If someone from Alaska or North Dakota moved in next door, I wouldn't begrudge his right to do so, even if his value system was entirely different from mine; I don't view people from Mexico or Russia any differently." I do too.  where's the controdiction with what patrick and I are saying.  we're not saying that these people don't have these rights.  we're only saying that the U.S. isn't as responsible for them as they are for american citizens.    look, what does the "Right to life liberty an pursuit of happiness mean."  does it mean that i can shoot you, and steal your stuff?  No, even though it might make me happy.  Does it mean that terrorists have the right to blow stuff up even though it makes them happy?  no.  does it mean that immigrants have the automatic right to be a US citizen evne though it would make them happy? no.  Everyone has those rights, regardless of where they are, i agree, and the people who live in countries that do so can ask for assylum.  Put in terms you MIT folk'll understand, we're arguing for a semi-permiable border, not an impermiable one.   but to say that we should let anyone in who is seeking more wealth, even if they are living in poverty, is absurd.  think about 1) the practical consequences of the entire world emmigrating to the US, and 2) why is it that we aren't a completely socialist/communist society and you will see why this is a poor argument.  "Moreover, my Mom immigrated to Canada from Communist Romania and turned into a productive, contributing member of her community. My Dad's parents immigrated to Canada from Poland and did the same. The US had an open-door policy until the early twentieth century, and many of our parents, grandparents and great-grandparents escaped poverty to pursue their dreams in the land of opportunity. To support closing the doors on immigration, now that we personally have reaped the benefits of our nation's open-door policies, is grotesquely hypocritical. "  my family, too, were immigrants, long ago.  but just as you would say that its unfair to hold people abroad responsible for the fact of their birth, why do I have less control over my countries laws because of the fact of mine?  regardless, we don't close our borders, we just make sure everyone who we let in 1) isn't a terrorist, 2) doesn't have any wierd flesh eating viruses, and 3) will behave in a productive manner.  look years ago we had an open door policy yes.  but is it hypocritical to change our policies when older ones can no longer work?  we used to have a 'everyone get's 40 acres and a mule' law.  we used to have great land races where people can stake out their land for free, because we had more land than we knew what to do with.  we don't do any of that anymore, does that make us hypocrites?  i don't think so.  policy changes.  we had enough room to accomodate huge numbers of immigrants so we let them in by the boatload.  can't do that anymore, so we don't.

						   WWE Summer Slam was phenominal, here's my review:  1) the first match was the Dudley boyz against La Resistance.  I have to say that La Resistance is a really lame angle-- the sort of silliness that 'Srgt Slaughter' devolved into during the first gulf war.  the anti-us vs us compontent is really stupid.  also they're poor wrestlers, and should be fired.  2) there were so many, SO MANY really good workers who were left out of the matchups. . . why no Jon Cena?  why no Rey Mysterio? why no Trish Stratus (actually there were NO women's matches at summer slam). . . even Zach Gowan was left off the bill (after his really brutal match against Brock on thursday night.)  why no IC belt match?  3) the highlight of the night was clearly CLEARLY when the 2nd rate announcer Coach stepped into teh ring and stabbed Shane O'Mac for Bischoff.  first off, the Shane/Eric match was going to be really lame, but bringing in coach was a huge surprise and it brought to the forefront a plotline that was really neat (the JR and King vs Coach as a bad fillin announcer)  also, we got to see Bischoff get stone cold Stunned.  awesome  4) the Angle/Lesner match, also spectacular.  The new Brock heel thing is working out, and woudl be a hwhole lot better if Brock could lose the 'goober' look on his face.  there were moments during the match when it was hard to remember that it was all fake, and Brock probably doesn't really want to kill angle.  Angle too, always does a great job of selling. . . the intensity and 'coming back from life threatening injury' go hand in hand, and Angle sells it right.  Plus these are two of the best workers in the WWE,   ditto the Fatal Fourway of Benoit/Tajiri/Ryno/Gurerra.  Eddie Guerrer may be a terrible stereo type but all four of those guys really sell their moves and work hard on the mat and on the mic.  5) Kane/RVD was good, we saw RVD do some really outstanding moves, like the VAN TERMINATOR, and a bunch of flips and stuff, typical of the risk-taking RVD.  and the plot line with Kane as a psycho is ok, it give them a lot of flexibility to turn Kane face or heel (it seems right now they're leaning heel, especially after Kane burned JR)  but the problem is, that they need to make a decision regarding him.  I think a lot of that match was backstage politics-- with RVD's job in jeopardy because he refuses to be political and wants more to be 'about hte fans,' and moving like he's going to quit RAW, and during the match, King kept saying things like "RVD isn't a quitter, he never quits, he'll take it to the end"  the symbolism was clear.  RVD still lost the match.    6) for GOD SAKE, Vince, if you happen to read this, you gotta make HHH lose.  we need new blood with the title.  you could have done it with Goldberg-- he's big enough to take the title, but if you make HHH too powerful people'll lose interest.  also, because of HHH's history, the elimination chamber would have been a KEY time to do it.  here are a few plotlines that would have worked (one for each of the other men in the chamber): a)Randy Orton stabs HHH in the back and takes the title, ending evolution (until Batista gets back) b)HBK is 1st man out and lasts throughout the match to beat HHH fair and square at the end, thus repeating Royal Rumble feat. c)Goldberg takes a beating from Nash but avoids getting pinned, and then takes on HHH in the end. d)Nash and HBK team up the way that Orton and HHH tried to, and then when they beat HHH, they fight it out, Nash wins. e)Jericho pretends that he wants to be in Evolution, and HHH says, "if you show me what you can do to help me during the elimination chamber, i'll let you in"  but then at the last min, he stabs HHH in the back to get the title.  all these plot lines would work well, AND result in HHH loosing.  also note that they could also all be undone during RAW tonight with HHH taking back the title in a regular match. . . And you'd still have given HHH a weakness--- the Elimination chamber.   Point is, We're sick of HHH, and we need some new blood.  tell him to stop macking your daughter and give up the title for a while.    I also think it might be a neat plot angle for HHH to lose, and evolution to fall apart, and he'll have to 'rebuild his empire.'  opportunity to make him a face, anyone?  All in all, it was a very impressive pay-per-view, but it needed a better ending.  WWE didn't use the Elimination chamber at all--- there was no reason why it couldn't have been just a regular match, why they used the Elimination chamber at all is beyond me.  but besides that, all the other matches were really really good.

						   a new micro-issue in the immigration blog war has erupted.  On  urlLink  Patrick's blog,    Julian comments that i am not really a libertarian.  THIS IS TRUE.  read my comments.  but he also makes a curious statement.  what he says is ""Individual freedom of association trumps this nebulous right to "determine your culture" collectively, which, if you think about it, is a deeply freaky and authoritarian notion."  i did not find it a 'deeply freaky and authoritarian notion.'  and I immed Julian about it.  the following conversation ensues.  So i thought i would post it before going into my reasonings, and i thought posting the dialogue was appropriate for  urlLink  you  , given your dislike of the platonic/socratic dialogues. nevertheless here it is: (warning, Julian has a much better command of libertarian/antilibertarian arguments, and in a true debate could probably take me to task on the issue.  nevertheless, i still maintain i have the right side on this particular issue.  also note, this has been edited for spelling, punctuation and grammer ONLY)  Julian: Well, in large part it's the analogy between a genuine association-- private citizens explicitly and voluntarily joining a club where they say: "you have to wear a tie and share our religious beliefs" or whatever, and a majority attempting to engineer the shape of a whole nation's culture.  We don't usually think governments have the same degree of lattitude as those smaller voluntary associations  Budisaffa: true enough-- and i wouldn't say that, for example, a group of blonde haired blue eyed germans have the right to 'disassociate' with jews by locking them away.  Julian: Well, even if they don't lock 'em away... can a country say "no jews allowed to move in" -- even if there are communities within the country that are happy to accept them? (Whereas I figure if a bunch of bigots want to start a blue-eyes-and-blond-hair only club, well, shit, that's their ugly little business)  Budisaffa: of course not, neither would i allow any sort of immigration policy that would say "no jews may immigrate into the US.  point is that the right to associate is already predicated on the 'right'ness of the category of the association-- i doubt you'd let say, "well those serial killing cultists have a right to assemble, so we can't really stop them ) Budisaffa: or pedifiles (better example)  Julian: Well, to just "assemble"?  Sure.  NAMBLA and whatnot.  If they start plotting how to pick up kids, that's maybe another story.   Budisaffa: fair enough but similarly, the assoication of people into a politcal unit is really only a 'government' if the goverment they would set up is just. . . I don't really consider the Nazis to be a government,  per se, as much as a group of thugs running around with guns.  {  editorial: this is a really contentious proposition, and bears its own blog post.  most probably this is a part of the core difference between me and libertarians.  but that's not for now-- jbs  }whereas if a group of skinheads would like to gather in a private home to 'hail' hilter, I can't really stop them.  as this would pretain to the larger debate, i would say that the 'right to associate' explicitly intends to protect policiatl associations. . . in the way that the right to free speech has the intention of protecting, among others, political speech.  therefore, an extention of that is that the right to associate would entail the right to associate with government-- entailing a right of that government, bearing and keeping the consent of those it already governs-- to not include those who would threaten the ideology of itself.  (wow the grammer of that sentace was shitty, but i hope you cna understand)     Julian: I get the gist, but I don't think the analogy quite works.  The right to associate protects (subnational) political associations (activist groups, etc) in the same way speech rights protect political speech.  But that doesn't mean "the right of the government to speak."  Indeed, there are many forms of speech (e.g. erecting a huge monument to the 10 commandments) precisely forbidden to government even as they're guaranteed to private parties.  Julian signs off to go to a cafe.  But i was still formulating my response, which is:   that's only because of the limitations of the other obligations of govenrment. . . but private citizens also have these competing obligations, they're just not enforced in the same way because a private citizen is only responsible for his own views whereas the government has to keep in mind those of 250million-odd citizens.  within the boundaries of what's allowed for government, it can still 'speak,'  for example it can say, "we will have a bicamerial, as opposed to a unicameral legislature." we might interpret the laws of a particular nation to be 'the speech' of the government, itself.    Indeed speech for the indivual and the laws for the government occupy much the same purpose in the life of its respective actors.  they both articulate values, etc.       point is that the right to associate of an individual corresponds to an obligation by government to maintain itself as an assoication that the people assented to.  As such, it has to police its own borders.  I've written before about the necessity of always allowing emmigration, but it seems there's a competing obligation to allow, but police, immigration.    Think of it this way.  Imagine the united States in a world in which tons of nazis (i love using them as example, they're just so damn evil) are trying to get into the united states.  they would enter and reconfigure the character of the polis, which is a reflection of the character of the people that comprises the chief political assoication.

						   Defending Capitalism:       So Storey and I have come to, at least, what I think is some form of agreement about where the core of the immigration issue is, which is to say that it divides along (simplistically) libertarian/communist lines.  I'm probably as much a libertarian as Storey is a Communist, which is to say not really, although leaning towards it.   But since this is were both our 'first principles' lie, i thought i might post about it directly.        So on  urlLink  Patrick's   blog, i make the claim that Capitalism divides morality and wealth, by making acquisition of capital an amoral thing--   So how to morally defend capitalism? well its been done in a number of ways, here are a few of my favorites:  1) John Locke's method:  the most basic right that anyone might possess, the most fundementally consistant with human nature is the right to oneself.  An extention of that right, the right to yourself, is the right to your own labor (locke sort of puts these two together, in essense the right to yourself and the right to your labor are THE SAME THING.)  property rights are built on that foundation.    storey has already made an argument against this viz a viz immigration when he says that most of what we own was stolen at some point.  For example, The european settlers stole the land from the native americans, who, in turn, stole the land from (i guess the buffalo? sounds silly, but some animal rights'ers claim that animals have all the same rights as people, that would include property rights) someone else.  Therefore, the people who originally have the right to the property, and everything that has come out of it (i.e. EVERYTHING IN THE GEOGRAPHIC BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES) actually belong to the natives and we, a bunch of immigrants stole it.  my response to this, is that at some point, ownership transfered.  When did this happen? As Tim would say, the line is hazy but it can still be drawn. It may be true that my ancestors did steal something from someone and it might have been passed through the generations.  but at some point 'the statute of limitations' expires. . . . it would seem absurd for the descendents of the Romanovs to come to me and say, "your great-great-great-great-grandpappy was an armed robber in 1832 and stole, in equivelent money, $1,000,000.  pay up." I see people who say we stole the land from the natives in somewhat the same manner (of course that doesn't justify most of the other things we did to them, trail of tears, etc.)  also, there's something of a 'good-faith' exception, dealing with inheritance.  If my dad steals $200, and wills it to me without me knowing that he stole that money, it sort of seems unfair to take it away from me. . . It was not MY fault that he stole that money, i was acting in accord with the law, once the money transfers to me it sort of seems unfair to penalize me.  this is a lesser, but important, argument.    2) an wierd quasi-marxist (i said it was wierd) theory i wrote a paper on once: the core marxist critique of liberal rights is that it separates man from man--- that it says, in essense, My rights extend so far as yours do not (see Marx's German Ideology for more)  But what capitalism also does is separate the political from the civil. . . Marx wrote about this in "On The Jewish Question," Marx, who himself was part jewish (and a rabid antisemite, let's hear it for self-hating jews).  he says that waht creates a capitalistic state, as such, was the distinction of the private and public selves-- that it forces equality among all participants, at least political equality. . . because contracts are only valid if both sides are on equal footing-- otherwise its not really a contract so much as one side forcing an action from the other.  in essense, marx would argue, Capitalism is the economic form of democracy and democracy is the political form of capitalism.  So long as you, or I, think that democracy is, in general, a good thing, we must assent to a capitalist system of some sort.   3) Capitalism rewards the good and punishes the bad. I'm not a total zelot of "the market will solve" the way some of  urlLink  my   urlLink  collegues   are, but occasionally they're rigth about it.  Capitalism certainly rewards efficency.  true that efficency does not equal morality, but there are instances that it does work.  See, for example T. Friedman's book "The Nexus and the Olive Tree" for more on that.  i see it working in 2 ways: 1) the state can often control immoral behavior through capitalism, by taxes or sanctions, and the people, at large, have control over the state through the typical democratic means.  and 2) capitalism gives the public at large power over economic actors to control immoral behavior through boycotts.  It just seems to me that the ammount of wealth someone has is an ammoral fact--- you can't make a moral judgement about someone based on their wealth any more than you can based on the color of their skin, or their religion, or eye-color.  Good people are rich and poor.  Bad people are rich and poor.  YOu can't assume that just because someone has money, they stole it, and therefore it deserves to go to poor people.  Similarly, you can't assume that some poor folk are only poor becuase of an institutional bias against them, so they deserve some rich guy's money.  It sounds callous, but it could be they're just lazy. (obviously not all of them, but i'm sure some poor people are just lazy)  This is, of course, counter-balanced by competing obligations of government to provide for "the Just Life" (which is, i believe, the core reason d'estat of government, see Aristotle's politics for more on that)  To use the greek distinction,   Bios   (political/moral life) is predicated on   Zoe,  (purely biological life) so some form of social safety net is necessary. . . . i would argue that the best form is "The Great Society," including progressive income tax, welfare of some kind, a healthy and vibrate middle class, etc. . . but complete equalization of wealth.  There is still something to be said for the fact that I earned $X, therefore i deserve to spend $X.

						   Defending the Terminator:  I've heard people's responses to Arnold's gubernatorial campaign in california range from sarcasm to outrage.  People have said that 'this shows how dumb americans are,' or 'how pop culture is editorially dead.'    but is this really true?  every personal account of Arnold Schw. . . I've ever read says that he's an intelligent, driven, perfectionistic, shrewd business man who also happens to be able to benchpress small buildings.  He's not Conan, he just played him on T.V.  and all those qualities i just mentioned would make for an excellent governor.    I'm not saying that he will/won't be a good governor, nor have I even looked at any of his campaign platforms (i assume they're mostly 'no taxes,' 'economic recovery' etc.) What I am saying is that he is a legitimate candidate and let's look at what he's promising to do before we start critizing him for being a joke.  After all, Reagan, who is an amazingly well recieved president (despite what you think of him, his popularity, especially among conservatives is undeniable), started off as a FAILED actor (people mostly forget that about reagan, that his acting was hideous) .    The only legitimate argument that people seem to have so far is Schwartzy's lack of political experience.  this is true.  but he's running for governor, not president.  experience, especially for gubernatorial races, just isn't as much an issue as it is in national elections.  many governors (including Christine Todd Whitman from NJ, FDR in NY ,  Mitt Romney from MA, and George W. Bush in TX  to name a few) were not politicians until they ran for governor.   If Arnold can successfully leverage his personal fame into political capital, that's call intelligent campaigning, not a sign of stupidity.

						   James posted this on his 'plan', an amherst version of blogging that none of y'all have access to, unless you're an amherst student or alum.   urlLink  Dersh   really blasts Chomsky as an antisemite and bigoted.    I am less critical of Chomsky, personally, i think he's just misguided, but not necessarily evil.    but enough of that.  Dershowitz can defend himself quite well without my tinkering.  Instead, i'd like to talk a moment about California. This morning i watched CNN Headline news talk about why California is in such a shamble-- and, no doubt they got it right.  Their reason:  direct democracy.  Its true, for a couple of reasons:  1) the people have passed resolutions which the government is obliged to obey without having adequete funding  2) the people have passed resolutions which prevent the government from raising money in certain ways (i.e. raising property taxes, etc.)   3) the people have passed resolutions preventing a deceasing of expendatures on certain programs already in effect.  so let me get this straight.  Davis can't cut programs, can't raise taxes, and has to pay for new programs?  and the economic fiasco that is california is HIS fault?  what?  are these people out of their heads?  Direct democracy barely worked for Athens, it certainly won't work for a state of several million people.    On a moral level, proponents of direct democracy usually give a tautology--- direct democracy is more democratic.  thank you. clap clap clap.  didn't realize that.  But the problem is that democracy for its own sake is dumb.  The reason why democracy is a valid form of government is that it creates a system which allows people to govern themselves.  that proposition has 2 parts.  1)people can govern THEMSELVES and 2) people can GOVERN themselves.  it seems that direct democracy allows for 1) but not 2).    Viva le electoral college.

						   I think Storey and I are going to have to agree to disagree.   Jokingly i said below, "does that mean we re-distribute land and wealth communist style? (don't answer that, you hippie pinko)" not really expecting this answer on his  urlLink  Blog  , "He adds the parentheses because he knows my answer is that   of course   we should redistribute land & wealth!  & we both knew from the beginning that our disagreement was more fundamental than this issue alone"  actually storey, i knew you were leftist, but i had no idea you were left of my friend KARL MARX!  but to put in my rebuttal on the matter (my debate with Sepdawg notwithstanding) i'll put it into the frame of a hypothetical syllogism: If you're society does not recognize a right to equalize property and allows for income inequality, then controlling the borders is consistant with your ideology.    for more on this debate see the post below (its actually 2 down)  as for your arguments about "entitlement," you write, "It is absurd for someone to feel a sense of entitlement based on the accident of birth"   1) doesn't a parent have a right to give what he owns to his child? if so, then inhereted property doesn't seem so arbitrary anymore.  My dad 'earned' his wealth somewhere along the ancentral lines, and it was passed down through a chain of inheritance.   2) you provide my answer for me.  "(ultimately, I believe, the only justification for a sense of entitlement is some grevious wrong being done to you personally, & even then I think one's entitlement in return is extremely limited & has little to do with retribution... but I'm getting off topic). " perhaps that entitlement can come from a person who believes the following:   'the old world oppressed the hell out of me. i came to the new world for a new chance.  i even fought a war for this land so that i may live freely.  now that i live in a free society, i have an obligation to make sure that the borders of that free society are protected so that other people will get to be free too.  yes, i understand that means that we will slow the influx of people freeing oppression into this country, but we will not stop it.  instead, we will make sure that there is a fair process that allows the truly deserving into America, and makes sure the terrorists and fascist seeking to destroy a regime based on rights and just governance stay out."    seems reasonable to me. . . where's the hypocracy?  p/s the chicken story is funny.

						   For you, Nick, i have changed the timestamp on the site for time in GUAM   also, the kindness of (stupid) strangers: some guy driving a moving van ran over the back end of my car.  Yes, that's right, monster truck style, he ran over my car. at least he seems to be paying for it--- he's given me insurance info, etc.  . . my car was parked on the side of the road, and i was not in it.  but i should of expected my car to be used as a parking spot.  but it sucks to have my car out of commission for so long. . . . who knows when the claims adjuster is going to show up, when i'll going to be able to get it fixed, how long repairs are going to take, and when i can get back on the road.  i hate cleveland circle.  can't wait to move to Comm Ave.

						   Storey, I love you, but this argument is pure stupidity:  "My point is that it's arbitrary & hypocritical for such people, a nation of immigrants whom the US either abused, had mercy on, or tried to keep out, to say that now that their people are in, they have the right to keep people out."  Are you friggin' nuts?  of course every country has the right to limit its borders.  .  .   just because the U.S. was an immigrant-open nation in years past why does that mean it always has to be one.  Don't times change, that's not hypocracy. . . that's life.  Look, my family were immigrants during a time when the US was an open border nation, does that make ME an immigrant? no, i was born a US citizen and i should have all the rights and priviledges thereto.  We do allow immigration, its not like we're closed borders, but we need to regulate that flow of immigrants.  by the way, once again, people who are truly Fucked-At-Birth (FAB) by the nation they were born into can get political asslyum.  That's not arbitrary, that rational.  By the way, don't I have a right to assemble- which entails a right to disassemble.  doesn't a nation have the right to decide what type of  nation-- what fundamental character-- it has (within certain boundaries), and if that differs from what their parents wanted, or what their great-great-great-great-grandparents wanted, so be it.And as for this "some people are born into poor countries" crap, look, some folk are born into poverty.  does that mean we re-distribute land and wealth communist style? (don't answer that, you hippie pinko)   simialrly, yes, it sucks that some people are born into shitty circumstances, and i feel for them.  but some folk are lucky and some folk aint.  that's just the way an imperfect world works.  They can ask to come to the US. but what they can't do is break the law by comming here illegally.  My family came here legally, it just so happened that back then we allowed boatloads of people in at a time.  Had the laws today been the laws then, i'm sure my family would have gone a different route (gotten a work visa, become a resident alien, taken the citizenship test, etc.) .   (here insert all the hundreds of thousands of economic reasons why opening the borders would destroy US standard of living and economy by flooding the market with cheap labor.  -- i'll leave that for Glen Whitman)  Back in the 1800s and early part of this century, this country was underpopulated.  we could, in fact needed, an influx of people to maintain ourselves, so we opened the borders and said, "anyone and everyone, we got room to spare, if ya want it."  now not so much.  does every affluent nation have an obligation to equalize wealth of the world or is it just us?  look, i don't see a refutation of my core argument that we have only a certain number of 'spots' in the US, and we have to, to some extent, pick and chose who we let in.  when you have to chose between those who follow the rules and those who don't, you pick the rule-obey'ers.  what YOU say to that is that some other people didn't follow today's rules years ago, when the rules were different, so the rules must be unimportant.  Storey, some people murder. does that mean the murder rules are unimportant?  no.    I'm not defending everything the INS does.  I'm sure the INS had done some shitty things to people.  but that's part of a beuracracy.  sometimes it'll make mistakes, there's no way around that.  but the answer of opening borders is dumb to any and all who want to be in this country is poor-- no pun intended.  and by the way, thank you for giving me the best argument against you. . .  "  Obviously the next logical step of this argument is that citizenship is a ridiculous concept in the face of the accident of birth, but leaving this where it is still makes a good argument for tearing down the INS & replacing it with "welcome to America" brochures & a nice waiting room."    indeed, the next logical step of your argument is getting rid of citizenship altogether.  As someone who has the right to be ruled by consent, i have the right to citizenship of this country.  Yes, i got lucky by being born in a US citizen.  Donald Trump got lucky by being born wealthy--- that doesn't mean i have a right to Trump's fortune.    "Now that their people got lucky, everyone else somehow has to "earn" entry"  everyone else doesn't have to 'earn' entry-- for what i understand of it, the citizenship criteria are quite easy to pass.  what they have to do is follow the established guidlines. Unless you can give me a reson why the people, themselves, and not their families or ancestors, who come in illegally have just as much right  to be here as the people who do so legally, i don't think you've argued anything really persuasive.    Think of it from this direction.  Why does a british citizen have a right to be an American?  because other british citizens have become americans?  that doesn't really make sense.    to close, i might point out that America is one of the very few nations in the world that allows complete intergration of its naturalized citizens.  Most other nations in the world have a seperate class of citizens, all to often a secondary class. --- you can move to France but never become a frenchman.  you can move to germany but never become a german.  but you can move to the US and become an American, with all the rights and priveledges that all other americans earn.  The only thing we ask, in return, is that you follow a simple procedure.

						   Review of Freddy vs. Jason:  since the major reviewers refused to do it, i'm going to. . . .  well, The hamburger faced villian squares off against the strong silent machete weilding goalie in Freddy vs Jason.  This amusing Romp has been long awaited by fans of the genre-- and are they not disappointed.  Bearing in mind that the two series have been first and foremost always about Eye-Candy, which FVJ has in gluttonous amounts, we have a film that fits into the ethos of both particular long running series.  One of the major themes of the movie is the cleverness of Freddy.  This is something that i thought the later Nightmare movies really forgot.  We see a darker, more brooding vision of the dream demon, unlike the laughing hyena version we see in Freddy's Dead and New Nightmare.    His counter part, the-always-silent Jason is in peak form.  We get a more inside look at what makes the Psycho Zombie tick in this movie. . . with more references than ever to the original villian of Friday the 13th, Jason's Mother.    Added to all this is the absurd amount of violence, gore, and carnage that we would expect from the two villians.  It seems like the makers thought, well, we've got two bloodthirsty maniacs, so we need twice the gore.  and indeed the red stuff was abound.    Finally, remembering that this movie is a romp, an eye candy festivus of an extraviganza, the humor is clear.  people seem to be unending bags of blood the likes of which 'the Black knight' from Monty Python and the Holy Grail might be proud of.  Hysterical references to old Freddy movies, with the line "how sweet, fresh meat" paraphrased into "how sweet, dark meat."  and comedy ensues.    Preview Trailer from the remake of the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE also looked impressive.  I hope they include the "chainsaw dance" from the original.

						     Maureen Dowd   proclaims "the end of the Internet," sounding a whole lot like Al Gore saying he invented it.  1 question, Maureen:  If stupid Political blogs are the Ragnarok of the Internet, does that mean your columns mean the end of literacy?  SAT ANALOGY:  Maureen Dowd is to newspaper columnists what:  A) Cato Katelin is to house guests. B) a Headache is to Bruce Lee C) George W. Bush is to political leaders D) all of the above   urlLink  Kristoff , on the other hand, gives us a great column on Religion in America.  My thoughts on the topic of religion have always been more of the "whatever makes you happy, so long as you don't bother me" ilk.  However, it is odd that only 23% of americans believe in evolution.  I think it was Denis Miller who once said that America's collective "cranial ridge is sloping like the shoulders of the barboy at the Kennedy Compound."    We should look for Truth in religion; truth is truth through whatever lense we find it through.  However, denying the physical world for the religious is folly.  Look, science is based on fact (what is) , philosophy on logic (what ought to be),  but religion is based on revalation (what we believe).  it has no, absolutely ZERO, discoursive value-- you can't really have a meaningful argument about what Jesus, or Buddha, or Zarathustra, or whoever did or didn't do-.  That is not to say that religion, or at least faith in general, has no value, it simply means that it can't occupy the same lifestyle nitch as philosophy or science.  I've talked much about the role of the mystical in life before,  search through my arichives to find it.   Look, i think its dangerous when philosophy tells us what is (read the fall of the Roman Empire some time), when Science tells us what ought to be (eugenics, antibellum south, and Nazi Germany), and when Religion tells us what is or ought to be.  we should learn what we can from religion, but never take it as factual or logical evidence.  it isnt.  i guess its a little ironic that a few days ago i was defending the american public from Eunich-house's  attacks, and today i'm attacking them myself.  go figure.

						   In Deference to the return of  urlLink  Adam "Big Pimpin'" Unikowsky   to the world of blogging, i thought i would respond to his most recent post on procedural vs substantive due process, as it pertains to jury nullification.  Now i'm a big believer in Jury Null, as well as procedural due process.  How?  well i think that jury nullification is part of the system, a final check on government so to speak: that even after passing through all three branches of government, if a law is so sucky (although perhaps not unconstitutional) then nobody will be convicted.  yes, its not a perfect check, but its an approximation, and probably a pretty decent one too.  As for lying under oath;  screw you, you lying sack of lying liar's lies.  (i just wanted to say that, don't take it personal) 1) you give ok analysis, but don't pretend its Kantian.  Kant said you should tell the Nazis that you are hiding jews.  he hated lies. a lot.  2) as for the analysis you gave, ". Sure, it ostensibly represents the will of the majority of citizens, and if you dislike the law, you could theoretically punt the legislators from office. However, in the real world, laws are drafted by corrupt, clueless, and frequently stupid legislators. The public is frequently completely unaware of the implications of new laws that are enacted. Most of the time they are totally apathetic, or influenced by a government that actively misleads them. "  This distrust of the populace rings in many of your posts.  But you don't have a right to agree with everything government does.  you ahve a right to have your voice in governmnet.  but just because you disagree with a few things, or many things, or even all things that your government passes, doesn't mean you are being ruled sans consent.  Specifically, you seem to hate the anti-marijuana laws.  few people agree with you more than i do.  i hate them.  they are stupid, innane, idiotic, orcish (where's my thesaurus?).  However, it is YOUR obligation to convince people and legislators that they are wrong.   The world doesn't revolve around your ideas of good/bad governance.  It becomes the individual's responsibility to act to change a government when you see something wrong with it. that's part of what a representative democracy does.    Think about a government which works on substantive due process.  everytime someone comes foreward with a new claim, theory, idea about what it would entail, the government would change, meaning that very few laws would be enforced fairly  also, if you believe in favoring substantive due process over procedural due process, you are not favoring " my own sense of substantive moral justice" over "the obscure rider that former segregationist Trent Lott tacked onto the budget in committee"  you are, instead favoring 250 million individual views about what substantive moral justice is (especially from all those people you seem to think are totally inept, uneducated, ralph wiggums in the USA).  PRocedural justice attempts to create a system of moral justice which is applied equally to everyone.    I guess it seems to me like you're saying at the same time,  1) Americans, in particular, and people at large, in general, are stupid, and 2) we need to trust those same stupid people to make the right desicions regarding jury nullification, self-government and 'substantive due process.'    seems to me that the only way to ensure that is with a firm system of procedural justice.

						   Here's a bit of a complicated backstory to today's post:  in response to  urlLink  Dean Esmay  , Amy and I have been arguing that groups that have faced oppression in the past need not be grateful to the society that formerly disenfranchised them for enfranchisement.    In the comments, I say:  the point is that telling people in oft-discriminated against groups to be grateful for the rights they have (ignoring that they SHOULD have those rights, and we--the rest of society-- were wrong in taking them away) is kinda like saying, "well you should eat this dog shit and like it, because elephant diarreah would be worse.  WOmen, african americans, gays, jews, and just about any other group you can think of that faces racism/biases/stereotypes should be angry whenever they are treated as a member of a group rather than an individual"  to which  urlLink  Amy   (whose site, by the way, has become one of my mainstays. . . i really need to put a link to it with the rest of my links, and if you haven't seen it, i urge you to go there.) in an after-thought writes, "Does that last comment ("Women, african americans, [etc.] should be angry whenever they are treated as a member of a group rather than an individual.") also apply to, say, racial/minority based preferences in education or hiring? After all, isn't that exactly what affirmative action is?"  that's the back story.   I decided that as an answer, i would need more than a comment, SO here's my answer, I would quote the simpsons, "short answer, no with a but, long answer yes with an if."    In other words, it depends.  There are many different systems of Aff Action, some are ok, some are not.  Some, like quotas, are derisive and do, in fact, treat people as a member of a group and not as an individual.    I would say that some schemes look at race/gender, and say, In today's society, people of this group ARE discriminated against, and DO hit barriers simply because of other people's racism.  This particular person has achieved so much despite that race/gender bias in the world.  That shows a strength of character we want in our employee/student body/whatever.    It shouldn't be that you get X because you are a woman, or an African American, or Gay, or whatever.  instead it should be that people should recognize that as a member of that group you have faced, met, and overcome significant social challenges.  This is not to say that White, Protestant men of European background cannot have that same strength of character.  It just means that, for them, that character needs to manifest itself in a different way.  Perhaps it means that the white guy faced economic challenges.  perhaps he put himself in a challenging educational tract.  Point is, there are just as many ways of showing true character as there are of affirmative action.  The right one is the one which shows that, while proud of your heritage, you are not determined by that heritage.   So what scheme of Aff action does that support, well perhaps one like the 'point' system-- where each candidate is assigned a point value based on, yes subjective, critera-- in which race is one-- but also socio-economic status, education, 'extra curriculars,' etc.  that way race, as a way of guaging challenges met and overcome, can still be taken into account, but is not a racial quid pro quo.  I hope that answers your question, Amy.

						    urlLink  Storey   claims that "everyone in the United States, save a few thousand abused survivors of the Native American genocide, only has citizenship as a result of that "generosity", doesn't it make it somewhat arbitrary to claim that such generosity can now be revoked & limited to such a great degree?  America's alleged founding principle was freedom, not safety. "  here's a list of large segments of american population that didn't come here through "generosity." 1) AFRICAN AMERICANS.-- forced here through slavery. 2) People claiming political assylum-- many immigrants from about 1920 on, especially from africa are political dissidents.  note that in my earlier posts on immigration i excluded political asslyum people.  note that i include the small but significant group of Jews that came to the U.S. to escape the holocaust in this group. 3) Anyone who can trace his ancestry back to the Revolutionary war:  they fought a war to be here. they won.  to the victors go the spoils.    (this last one does eek a little of "might makes right" but that's the type of world we live in.  why is Texas american soil, or hawaii, or california for that matter. . . why does israel have a claim to Jerusalem?  because fighting, and winning a war over territory does give some right to it.  whether or not it should is a different story.)  but i think my comments earlier really does respond to storey's key point, that we don't have the 'right' to widthdraw our 'generousity' in letting immigrants in.  So some extent i agree, we draw much of our strength from diversity, and at the very least, immigrants tend to be hardworking, productive, active, members of society.  but, and i've cut and pasted this from my comments to sepdawg's comments below, however, there are people whose first action upon entering the united states is to avoid the system by entering illegally. We have no evidence that these people will be productive members of soceity, the only thing we know of them is that they've avoided the established immigration procedures.  i think that's a discisive point. being a citizen is more than just material benefit-- otherwise we'd all just flock to the country that has the highest standard of living (which is, i believe Luxemburg, although i may be mistaken-- its definately some wierd european aristocracy-ruled city-state). Being a citizen is also about giving tacit agreement to the rules of that society. by the same token, we allow emmigration-- people within our country who disagree with the system of american government are free to withdraw their approval and find a country which is more to their liking.  Its not that we shouldn't let anyone in, but if the choice is between the people who go through the system and the people who arrive illegally, we have to favor those who do all the right things.

						   i've done a lot of 'thinking' posts recently, so i think its time for a 'doing' post.  Last night, on the way home from relaxing with Emanuel, mikey, and Gerry, a woman came up to me on the T. and said, "are you famous, you look famous."  of course, she did smell of gin, and her words sounded more like "is yus famouth?  ya lok famoth."  So I did, what i think most of us would do, perhaps the only thing to do in such a scenario, i said, "hi, I'm john popper, from blues traveler." needless to say she got real excited and asked me to sign an autograph.

						   So I sort of object to  urlLink  Unikow's   belief that anyone was for war with iraq believes that Iraq was responsible for Sept. 11.  I believe war with iraq was justified, not because iraq was involved with sept 11th (which it probably was not) or because iraq had a womd program (which it probably did) but because i would say that the United States has a right, and a duty, to fight oppression wherever it exists.  sometimes this means interaction (see China, where the cultural export of Americanism is creating increasly democratic reforms--albeit slow, but definately progressive)  sometimes this means sanctions (see Cuba, although a bit more controversial) and sometimes this means war.    Sadam mass murdered his own population.  he attacked his neighbors with no real provocation.  He oppressed his people to the point of desolation.  There are many many real good reasons to hate Sadam.    I hate it when people compare Sadam to Hitler, but look at the mass graves we found.  look at the way he treats the Curds, look at the massive propaganda machine in Iraq.  If we were justified in fighting the Nazis, i think are justified in fighting against Iraq.  I don't think, as unikow seems to say all pro-war people do, that Iraq used chemical and biological weapons during the war.  I DO think that sadam represented a clear and present danger the to safty of americans home and abroad, and to the rest of the free world.  Taking him out of power was a must, although our administration has given the wrong reasons for doing so, and has failed in its post-war obligations.  Unikow also seems to think that historical coincidences are relevent.  he writes, "Many voters will vote on other issues that are just hopelessly dumb. For instance, based on historical trends, many voters would favor Bush because he is taller than Dean, and therefore "just seems" like a better leader. Others will vote for Bush because they believe he is a Texas rancher, due to his frequent visits to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, even though he grew up in New England, and constructed his resort-like ranch property purely for the purpose of political campaigning. Still others will side with Bush due to Bush's career as a CEO, not knowing that his business career was actually comically unsuccessful. "  Yes it's true that something like 90% of the time the taller candidate wins.  Its also true that there never has been a nonprotestant president re-elected.  does that mean that Catholics are doomed to never have more than JFK?  one president. jeez the catholics are really lacking in leadership.  I would guess that there are many other silly historical coincedences, like the guy who had better kindergarden grades usually wins.  Unikow would be hard pressed to give some sort of rational explaination for these trends that have any relevent meaning other than they are just massive coincedences.  Such things happen.  It doesn't mean america is full of stupid people.  There might be social reasons for these, but sociology isn't an exact science and people break trends all the time (just look at the fact that Gore defeated Bradley in the primaries, Bradley was at least 3 inches taller than Gore, who was, in turn, a good inch or two taller than Bush.) I doubt you'd be able to find anyone who says, "well, i voted for bradley 'cause he was the tallest candidate.  jeez the country really lost out by having a president who's only 5'11."  I won't vote for dean because, as a dove, he would tacitly support such a regime as Iraq.  I didn't vote for bush, and i probably won't again, but i can still see why an intelligent person might do so--specifically anyone who earns more than $175,000 a year and votes 'their pocket-book,' rather than 'their conscience.'  if Unikow wants to say that no one should vote in their best interest rather than in common interest, that's a whole other debate altogether.  "The number of Americans who vote for dumb reasons is far greater than the number of Canadians or Europeans who vote for dumb reasons. "  This remains to be seen.  I would say that the Euro was a massively stupid idea-- on par with 'he was taller', and yet many many people voted for it (or at least for parties that support it)  And, i would say that in europe the system is worse for it because if 1% of the population believes in the tennents of the Trancendentalist meditation party, the Trancendentalist meditation party gets 1% of the representatives.  Austria elected a neonazi, and its not like Austria has never seen fascism before.  Germany elected the National Socialists to 'keep the trains ontime.'  the world is full FULL of poor ideas being voted in.  perhaps this means that EVERYONE is stupid.  perhaps this means that the system isn't perfect.  or perhaps this means that power hungary people will always seek power, and sometimes they will find a way to it.  Yes apathy is a problem in the US. . . but is it any more of a problem than in France, where workers, in the thrall of Onri, seem to strike every few weeks? or in Great Britian where the Sex Pistols evolved from massive disilusionment?    Some have even suggested that Apathy is a direct corellation to comfort. . . societieswho are more well off tend to be more apathetic, because the stakes are less for them, if taxes go up, most people won't starve to death, whereas in many societies this is not the case.   but the Unikow's Jerry Springer like final thought is the icing on the cake.  Let's take it line by line: "But maybe the lesson from all of this is that underhanded political maneuvering is justified"  no, but the American Government is set up specifically to counter the fact that people WILL use political maneuvering. (see Federalists #41and 80)  "Lots of political leaders impose legislation that the population ignores or does not understand, for their own purposes." those who do so will not see re-election.  it is up to the opposing candidates to show why an idea is bad.  and by the way, they don't "impose" legislation.  there is no King in the US government.    "Lots of unelected policymakers, both judges and bureaucrats, implement laws according to their own whimsies, without regard to the actual congressional directive (if a coherent one even existed). Many people deride this as undemocratic and therefore unacceptable" Undemocratic does not necessarily mean unacceptable.  the Supreme court is undemocratic.  point is that the democratic and undemocratic branches of government check each other.    and, for the record.  I believe in evolutionism.

						   Soul Caliber 2 release in 20 days. "Loosely Based" now available on amazon.com. . . . Congrats again to Storey--- What Naghas!  last night i had a dream so surreal that i think it bears retelling:  As the election day approaches a new democrat emerges as the front runner for president.  None other than APDA dino, Matthew Stein!  but, as matt finds out, running against GWB is difficult, especially since GWB has been replaced by APDA'er Jeremy Pober!  just as election results are being tallied, I wake up.    I wonder who would win?

						   So  urlLink  Lauren   sees a problem in the overdramatic article written by  urlLink  Bob Herbert   talking about the deportation of an illegal immigrant.  While i agree that the deportation seemed a little harsh, it stills seems to me wrong when the deportee's wife exclaims, "he did nothing wrong."  he did. he entered the country illegally.   He paid the fine for it, admitted that he did so.  Yes, he was in the process of applying for legal resident status.  Yes, he has family in the united states.  But it seems to me that illegal immigrants are, indeed, at the mercy of the United States INS.  Lauren claims that this doesn't make the United States any more secure but i disagree.  Tighter borders makes sense, we hear about foiled terrorist plots every few months, many of those foiled plots were stopped by INS border patrolmen working along side FBI and other intelligence organizations.   More than that, immigration is NOT a right.  it isn't.  its a privelidge we offer because we see some vague merit to diverse cultural experience but it doesn't outweigh security and financial concerns that many people who are in the united states.  Imigration is at the sole discretion of the government.  if you chose not to obey the established rules-- painstakingly long though they may be, and enter the country illegally, you chose to run the risk of prison, fine, and deportation.    Despite my own brush with the border patrol  (Danny Schwarcz, Storey Clayton and Ben Branzel can fill you in on that), the system is our perogative.

						   haven't done one of these in a while:  urlLink          what's your cowboy bebop theme song?    Also,  urlLink  Sepdawg   comes up with an excellent idea.  I leave it to him to explain the pros of his "generallity" amendment to the constitution.    I'd like to see if i can come up with a way to clarify/solidify what he says, "Only amendments that refer to a principle or a class of actions or individuals may appear independently in the constitution" I can think of a couple of ways of doing this. 1) put in an amendment that says "judges exercising judicial review are to interpret the consitution as passing judgemnts on classes of actions" or something like that. . . making it so that all amendments are considered in court as general--- then a constituional amendment regarding 'same-sex' marriages would ban all marrages altogether-- an impossible scenario.  2) raise the critera for new amendments from 3/4ths to 4/5th, and unimous among states (although each state can pass it at lower majorities) -- the purpose of the supermajority for new amendments was to prevent amendments like "flag-burning" or "no gay marriages"-- to prevent a tyranny of the majority.  With a harder supermajority to reach, it then becomes harder to pass amendments, gauranteeing that only really really popular ones would be passed.  3) it could be that no amendment is necessary-- if its only to protect gay marriages, perhaps all we would need to do is have homosexuality included as a 'protected group,' and apply the equal protection clause.  I have to say that I think its telling that we need a constituional amendment to PREVENT gay marriage.  What that would imply is that it is now legal, or at the very least, soon to be legal.  I've always felt that the definition of a family is extremely important to the form and structure of a  just government-- see Aristotle's Politics on that, i think he's on point there, also Rousseux as much to say on the matter.  Point is that although I agree with most conservatives that both family values and character matter in politics, simply saying "i am for family values" does not mean you're against gay marraiges.  Seems to me that i'd rather see a loving gay marriage than a disfunctional hetrosexual one.    Sepdawg also poses an interesting philosophical question at the bottom of his post.  I'll have to think about it for a while. . . his question, distilled, is as follows: if you're a nonconsequentialist, which i am, and you're driving a trolley that can either is aiming at 5 people.  the only other option is to divert it to hit only 1 person.  In the heat of the moment, you make a mistake and aim to the one person, do you, upon reflection, change it back?  part of what makes this question so difficult for nonconsequentialists is that it presumes consequentialism--- that is, it already favors a particular view.  As a nonconsequentialist, i'd say, first, that the question isn't WHAT you would do, but WHY would you do that.  It is intentions that determine moral worth, not the particular actions.  I've always found these 'would you save x or y' questions to be a little unfair to nonconsequentialists.  Nonconsequentialism should be thought of as more a way of thinking than a way of acting-- a nonconsequentialist might be able to argue that you should save X or Y; each providing reasons (ultimately one would be more rational than the other).   as I say, that's just my first-impulse-gut-reaction to the question.  For a more complete answer i'll think on the topic for a while and post on it later.

						       Is Racism funny?      Amherst Debater  urlLink Dave Gottleib  writes about a moment of antisemitism at amherst involving a terrible play on words of MOO (the sound that a cow makes) and Jew (pernounced JOO).    as someone who appreciates an off-color joke from time to time, i was strangely offended by the joker's pun.  Can it actually be that when it comes to my own ethnic background, i am not so free with my humor?  In my own personal effort against the rigidity of thought and of action of PC, i have often intentionally challenged conventions by teasing homosexuals, catholics, europeans (especially the French, Germans, and British), minorities, the disabled, the mentally challenged, the short, war widows, anyone who doesn't move so well, and the Amish.  I have even been known to make jokes about the size of my own "jewish" nose.  so what's the problem?  why did it seem so hateful when someone else joked about my own ethnicity?  well, part of the problem is that when i do attack others for their ethnic origin/creed/religion/nationality/handicap/whatever, I do so in context where everyone around clearly understands that I am only joking and do not actually think that anyone is less of a person because of being a member of said group.   I do believe that P.C. represents a distinctly dangerous social trend-- its a study in overcorrection for past wrongs.  Racism in society won't disappear when we eliminate prejudicial jokes from our vocabulary.  The problem is the underlying lack of respect for other nationalities/creeds-- clearly i do not treat people as part of a group rather than as an individual, or at least i strive not to.  When I tell a 'wrong' joke, i do so with the understanding that I am making fun of both the logic of racism-- the logic that states that stereotypes can be applicable to individuals-- and the logic of PC--that we must treat every minority group as if they were a fabrige egg-- as much as the group itself  Dennis Miller once noted that our sense of humor is exactly that: a sense of what you find funny and that off-color humor is a great way of collectively laughing at how barberic we once were as a group.  It says that we have evolved as a society to the point where we can look back at our own mistakes and say "wow, we were assholes, its funny how bad we were."  and groups who have been historically discriminated against can say, with a smile, "yup, you were, but we love ya, anyway."    but none of that understanding is present with the 'Moo/Jew' joke.  It is nowhere clear that the writer understands that Jews are, also, people, and that the premises of morality dictate that they ought to be treated no differently than anyone else.  If this indeed was the joker's intention, than he is guilty of nothing more than a bad pun.  If, on the other hand, he intended to slight the Jewish faith, intentionally and maliciously, then he is guilty of much more.

						   the draft is progressing well, athough dammit, Storey and Zimmy, why do you make such good choices.   urlLink  view the draft as it's happening here

						   Before i get into the nitty gritty of today's post, a few notes on apda draft 2:  its happening WAY TOO SLOWLY. so would all the participants please email me your phone numbers so that when its your choice i can call you and get your choice asap (i'll postpone the phone calls until after business hours.) three days into the draft and we're still in round 1.  unacceptable.    urlLink maggie gallagher  seems to be a bit ambivelent towards 'rape shields,' she says that protecting the identity of a rape victem is 'fairly' paternalistic, even though she ends up thinking that its ok to be paternalistic in this case.  what that seems to say is that she isn't convinced that a rape victim having his/her identity protected isn't a right--- paternalism isn't and can't be when the government protects a right.  Is it paternalistic for the government to have to abide by the laws of free speech? is it paternalistic for the government to have to abide by the rules of fair governance?  no, those are the government fulfilling its primary function and obligations.  so in this case, is it really paternalistic for government to hide the identity of the rape victim to the public?  not really.     her first argument (although she later rebuffs herself) is "To charge a person with a crime is a public act. The right of the accused to face his or her accuser is fundamental. Women (or men) who seek to use the power of the state to incarcerate a fellow citizen have to be prepared to do so publicly. It is simple fairness"   but Kobe Bryant DOES know who accused him.  the prosecutors and jurors do too.  The only 'person' who doesn't is the public at large: they do not have a need-to-know.  This case isn't being tried on FoxNews (and thank god for that) its being tried in a court of law; and Bryant's celebrity status makes the distinction really important.   Gallagher goes to say, "I do not believe it is true that rape victims are still deeply stigmatized. I don't think Americans would refuse to do business with, or become friends with, or honor with community leadership, or marry a woman who had been raped"  1) this is patently untrue.  there are many MANY places in this country in which people might look at a rape victim (especially if its a man, and it does happen) as someone who was involved in 'something shady' and someone to be avoided. 2) its not really the issue, the issue is whether or not THE VICTIM feels stigmatized by society, not whether or not society has stigmatized the victim.  its a victim's rights issue, not a freedom of information issue.    ultimately rape is an invasion of one of the most private rights a person can have, and to subject someone to a second invasion of privacy isn't just cruel, its barbaric.  stopping that isn't justified paternalism, its just justified.

						    urlLink according to this  some dude is challenging NFL rules that say that he has to be out of highschool at least 3 years before he can participate in the NFL.  he cites the fact that most other major sports have more lenient rules, and calls the NFL a monopoly.  this is stupid.  the NFL, as a private corporation can set any rule it wants.  it can say, "people who want to play have to be able to stand on their head and speak latin" if they want.  that's the right to association.    Its different for him to argue that its sort of generally unfair that he can't play but the correct rememdy isn't in the courts.  This is a trend i really dislike in american society: that anytime anything vaguely unfair happens, people say, "that's unfair and hence unconstitutional," or "the courts will fix it."  no.  the courts can only do a specifically and intentionally narrow range of issues. Unfortunately its also my impression that the courts have broadened their own powers by allowing such cases to proceed and rewarding them with favorable lawsuits.  also Aha--- thanks storey, i got it, and emily's in too.  also Sepdawg: i like the new format.  also, for once, i tend to agree with everything you said.

						   So feeling much better, my thoughts turn to the Storey/Segal fantasy Apda League, which has now expanded to include (definately) Zimmy and (maybe) Russo.    that's 4 total. that'll make a good league.  Pulling names out of a hat for the draft, this is what i got:  1) Zimmy 2) Storey 3) Jordan 4) Jonathan Marcus (NEW) 5) Emily Garin-Clayton  and the nice part of the way we're doing the draft, we don't all need to be nearby to start the draft.  I'll just make an email list.   also, because we're starting so late (after the first tournament of the year) i wonder if we should include Williams.  my inclination is that if we do, it'll give an unfair starting advantage to people who are picked up who placed well at williams, but at the same time, its just one tournament, and it'll end up even by the end of the year.  but i'll leave that, and all other disputes about the rules, open to vote by memebers of the league.   oh, and there's still room to join-- before Johnmakes his 2nd pick (he gets 5st and 6th pick; that is last pick in the first round and first pick in the 2nd round) so email me if you're interested (jordan_segal@hotmail.com)

						   To kick off the start of the debate season,  urlLink  Eunich house   gives a brief lesson on debate.  while Adam had much more sucess on apda than I did, i would like to highlight one of the things he says.  As someone who has judged many many rounds, i think his #11 is really the most important thing he says.  "Many LOR's will say something like "for them to win, they must show...". Play ball with this in PMR. One effective strategy is to accept the burden cheerfully and spin your case so that the burden is met - in which case they have retroactively accepted your victory. If this won't work, explain why their burden is dumb and doesn't make sense. But don't just let the burden stand out there. "  in fact, i would almost say this is a necessity in PMR.  if side gov drops burden arguments, its kinda like saying, "well, we agree with the opp's view of our case." that can kill you dead.  I find the first way Adam says to deal with Burden arguments-- agree with opps burdens and show why the case mets those burdens-- to be the most persuasive way to frame a PMR.  Start with an overview, that says, "well side opp has gotten the right idea with their burdens, so i'm going to show you why we meet those burdens. (and maybe give you good stuff on the side as well.)"  and then your three crystalization points are why you meet those burdens.  often this can win you the round.   on case construction, there are a few different 'types' or 'forms' of cases that can be really interesting.  my favorite is the "personal dillema vs professional obligation" case. the way this works is you set someone up to be someone who passionately believes X, but who has some kind of obligation to ~X. . .   here's an example:  you are an abolitionist judge in the north during the 1840s.  a Runaway slave comes to you and says, "don't send me back to the south," but because of the fugitive slave clause, you should.  what do you do? opp choice.  Eunich house seems to think that this is a 'Psychological' case, which revolves around the psychology of the individual, well that's what the case turns into if the OPP sucks.  the real way to attack this case is to take it on face value, and say, "well yes, sometimes you should do things you don't want to/think are wrong, because you promised." or "the basis of law is morality, and therefore the law can/should never compell you to do something immoral."   Both arguments can be pursuasive and both are based on interesting moral dillemas.    a second type of case that i really enjoy is the balls out version of "X is moral."  where X is something that seems atrociously wrong.  for example: Torture is morally acceptable.  Bear in mind that the only way for these to be fun cases are if the Gov Accepts the biggest burden that still leaves them fair ground.  if the gov says, "well, by torture we're only going to say for the interests of national security, and only in cases when nuclear weapons are involved." then it becomes silly.  As a judge, i DO appreciate when gov teams take on added burdens, so long as they know what they're accepting, and they defend it well.  Bear in mind, your job isn't to convince me you're right, but to do the best debating in the round.  If you take something that's absurd and make it sound reasonable, that's better debating than someone who takes something that is intuitively right and explain why its intuitively right.   the Final type of case that I find typically well put together is the "X type of government vs Y type of Government."  Williams debaters Pinkel and Gallagher excelled at these.  the Key to this type on Gov is to explain the key difference, the difference in principle between the two.  that way you get the best debate because the opp team has some idea what they're debating about even if they've never heard of that type of government before.   so that's my take on case construction.

						     SILLY HIPPIES    according to  urlLink  This   New York Times article, the propegation of soy and soy products is increasing the pace of deforrestation in the Amazon.  I find it greatly ironic that the same 'tree-hugging' hippies who lobby for larger rain forest protections and who snear every time i take a bite of my old fashioned non-soy meat hamburger with a slice of old fashioned non-soy cheese on top, are contributing to greater slash-and-burn efforts in the amazon.  So i want to see a massive hippy boycot of soy products.  aww shit, that would mean so many hampshire students starving to death.  let's see just how committeed these people are.   speaking of silly hippies, why is Amazon taking so long to get me my very own copy of "LB?"

						   thanks to sepdawg for this one, although not really into the Pixies:        Hey         It's hard to get to know you, but once people do, they're in for a wild ride. You had a rough childhood, and it reflects in your speech and mannerisms- you're focused on things like whores and crack babies, which fascinates people at first but may ultimately drive them away. Despite your somewhat depraved outward persona, you're a truly decent person who craves and deserves love and friendships.

"His Jesus is much more intimate and reflective."   also, maybe i'm just a juvenile at heart, but i found this    urlLink hysterically funny :   On a final note; i will never ever Ever     EVER     take anything storey clayton says seriously ever again.

						   a few people have complained to me that i always say "more on that later," but never get around to it.  so as promised, a few words on Dean's political platforms. (see link below)  1)  Workers rights, while important, are certainly NOT guaranteed in the constitution.  what amendment are they? what section deals with workers rights. however, if Dean (or whoever wrote these talking points) means that they are   important   rights, that  should be   in the constitution, well, i might be pursuaded to go along with that-- so long as the Unions don't get too powerful, they can be a critical element to protect workers from exploitation. . . if they do become overpowerful (as in european visions of trade unionism) they can become exploitative themselves.   2) bravo to making broadband to all Americans a national goal--- how he wants to do that is still critical but at least its a stated goal.   3) the sucess by 6 program, while demonstrative of Dean's commitment to Affordable healthcare, could not possibly work nation-wide. . . however, it is good that he's committed to national healthcare.  4) Dean's opposition to the War in Iraq.  hmm, this is a tough one.  he does say that he wants the U.S. to be a 'moral force.' well, that requires 2 things: 1)morality, and 2) force.  in otherwords, occasionally military force is required (esp. if he choses Gen Wes Clark (ret) as his running mate).  It could be that Dean and I agree on the fact that sometimes we need to proverbially kick some tyrannical ass, even if its not, necessarily a specific threat to the U.S. even if we disagree that Iraq was one of those situations.  but more clarification here is needed  5) yeah, "no child left behind" is a peice of crap.  "committed parental obligations" is a good pipedream, i'd like to hear more about what he wants to do with children who have parents who 'just don't care.'  6) a balanced budget is generally good, but occasionally a state can and should deficit spend or surplus save.  but Thank god dean wants to repeal the shitty shitty bush's "wealthy 1%" tax cuts.  7) i guess the place that Dean wins most to me is where he says, at the very end, "The Death penalty should be used in only the most serious cases."  seems Dean is one of the few politicians who take a more deep look at the death penalty, rather than saying "Killem all" or "no deaths" I do believe that the death penalty is justified, even if i'm not sanguine about it.   so that's my take on Dean.

						    urlLink  a pitbull get's sentimental in his old age.    on a more personal political note; my next door neighbors, who are big Dean-ites, have been trying to get me into Dean;  at first, i want to say that there really is something appealing about the way he's running his campaign, and i hope that he's rewarded, in some way-- even if it isn't the presidency-- but it seems like that sort of grassroots, old school style has the ring of 'old hickory,' without the indian shooting.    but here's a link to Dean's policy talking points off of his blog, (note: you will need Adobe Acrobat to read it)  urlLink http://images.deanforamerica.com/docs/policy_talking_points.pdf   not sure i agree with all of them, but i don't have the time to do an indepth analysis of them. . . but i encourage comments from all you out there in the blogosphere-- as I formulate my own beliefs.    I am still a Wes Clark man, myself.

						   Quoath Storey Clayton: "-If we spent as much time memorializing every violent death in the world in 2001 as we did mourning September 11th victims, how much time would we spend in such mourning?  How bout if we only limited it to civilian deaths since then caused by the US military?"  couple of comments to you, long-haired hippy:  first, i'd ask why is it wrong to feel worse about the deaths of those closer to you? the-mostly-americans who died in the WTC attacks are more impactful to us, because you or I could have decided to visit the WTC on that day, whereas it seems less likely that you or I would happen to be in Iraq on any given day.  but more importantly, don't you see a distinction between accidental civilian causalties caused by the American Military fighting, in essense, to free those very people and an unprovoked and intentional attack on a civilian building, designed specifically to kill as many innocent bystandards as humanly possible.  Look, when the US goes to war, even if you think that war is wrong, we try as hard as we can to avoid civilian casualties for several reasons, i'm not going to claim that all of them are moral reasons (in fact, i would say many are practical, but that's what we train our military to see-- the practical consequences).  regardless, we attack military outposts, we use smartbombs and satillites, we put US soldiers at risk in order to ensure that intelligence is accurate.  However, 'collateral damage,' happens.  We cannot avoid it.  but its better to fight the fights that need fighting (yes, yes, you are going to say that no fights need fighting)  let me put it this way.  what if FDR, Churchill, De Gaulle and Stalin got together on the Eve of WWII and said, "well, we abhor those dang Nazis, but fighting is just wrong, we don't want to kill innocent people along the way."    if they had done that, the gist of this blogpost would have been "deuchland uber alis."  sometimes you need war; it is, as Clausewitz once said, 'politics by other means.'  point is that yes, we regret the deaths of people who die because their leaders have decided to go to war, but so long as our intention is just, the war is just, and their deaths become collateral damage.

						    Musical chairs with the Law   Well, its finally happened, the music industry has decided that it can take no more and has decided to sue users for filesharing music.  this is very very silly, for a couple of reasons:  1) going after a few individuals to set the precedent and to scare others into not-sharing is arbitrary and coprecious.  we, in debate, often talk about  how a major requirement for law is that people have to know what the consequences of their actions are, especially for law. . . think about it, apda-ers, how many times have you argued that its unfair for someone to not know what the law is, or what the punishment for a particualr crime is.    if only 250 people are punished out of millions of users, that seems like selectively enforcing the law to such an extent as to make the law arbitrary.  while this isn't as bad as if they decided only to enforce it against particualr minorities, its still quite atrocious--- its really unfair for those 250 odd people to bear the burden of the crimes of several million others.  but that aside, its not really a crime-- the fair use part of copyrights says that the biggest arbiter of fair use is market impact. . . that is what the impact on the market of your particular infrindgement is.  now if the Recording industry is going after file sharers- which it is, for sharing-- which it is not, this would not fall under fair use.  however, the industry is going after sharers for having the files; an important legal distinction.  after all, what's the market impact from a single individual having-- say-- 1000 mp3s, even if that means they won't buy 1000 CD because they have the songs they want on mp3s. . . well chances are that they wouldn't have purchased 1000 CDs anyway, even if they never buy a cd again, the market impact is still marginal, at best.    The Recording industry needs to realize that physical recordings are becoming a thing of the past, much as  urlLink  this NYTimes op-ed   says.    so here's a few idea on how the industry could change to accomidate the new media of MP3s:  1) More Live recordings: if the industry has more live recordings, people are more likely to buy them--- think about grateful dead fans; they 'bootleg' thousands of different versions of the same songs, because they're on different days.  If the industry can capitalize on that trend, it would make up a chunk of its lost business.  2) More merchandizing: most of the self-recording bands (The Allman Bros Band, and its associates Government Mule, Greg ALlman and Friends, Phil Lesh and Friends, the Derek Trucks Band, and the Dicky Betts Band -- god they're uncreative with the names. . . ) have done this quite well.  they charge more for Tshirts, zippos band memorabilia, and then turn around and keep ticket prices down and allow bootlegging. .. the reson is that fans will buy the merchandise simply to 'have a part of the band.'  3) flat fees instead of per-CD: If the industry charges people a flat monthly  fee, and then allows X number of CDs/Songs per month, that's also a very workable model.  People just don't want to pay $20/CD, especially if its only for a few songs they want.   all of these are sort of generally changing the recording industry model from a consumer product model to a more service oriented model. . .   at least that's the way i think the Recording industry should go.

						     MORE ON NUKES    (posted after re-reading  urlLink  Phil Greenspun's blog post on nukes vs. oil  )  I suppose neither my nor Patrick really addresses Mr. Greenspun's arguments directly, which is to say that the original question wasn't so much whether to invest in Nuclear power but whether or not it is wise to invest in iraqi oil.  what Mr. Greenspun doesn't note is that we aren't really investing in iraqi oil, but in iraq. What iraq needs, right now, is money to rebuild itself.  the easy way for it to do that is clearly to rebuild its oil production capabilities, on the saudi-model-- where us companies sponsored in part by the US government, build the oil refineries and then hand over control to Iraq, but maintain a stake in oil production.    in the short term, this is clearly a mutually beneficial way of rebuilding iraq, regardless of whether or not there are better sorces of energy available in the world (which there are.) In the long term, virtually all of the oil producing world is going to have to find a new cash crop as oil supplies dry up.    i guess its a classic short term-gain vs long term interests problem. . . framed this way, Does it make more sense for Iraq to have money now? or later?

						    urlLink  Patrick   talks a bit about nuclear power on his blog, and, if i may recall my sophmore year of highschool's Renewable Energy debate topic, maybe i can opp his blog for a moment.  ahem---may I quote C. Montgomery Burns, "Homer, due to your valient efforts, you've turned a potential Chernobyl into a mere 3 mile island."  just because nuclear reactors are, largely, safe, doesn't mean that an accident can't happen.  Its kinda like airplanes: accidents don't happen very often, but when they do, watch out!    also, why not paint a target right on nuclear reactors as places for terrorists to fly planes into.    the biggest problem is "NiMBY"-- Not in MY Back Yard, which is to say that nobody wants a reactor near them, for just those reasons.    also, patrick uses the wrong determination for environmental damage. the waste produced is like a billion times more costly to maintain and like a trillion times more hazardous than virtually all other forms of energy.  The analogy isnt between nuclear and coal;  we both agree coal is shitty too.  Point is both are bad.  can't we find a better sorce altogether (hydro electric, wind power, geothermal, solar, etc.)  There is some hope on this front for Fast Breeder reactors, which reprocess the waste into smaller, but more radioactive ammounts, which would be good, i guess, but from what i hear they're still really very experimental.   there is also a significant environmental problem in thermal pollution-- where the reactors raise the temperature of nearby rivers to such an extent that fish and wildlife tend to die off. although it seems this might be an easy engineering problem to fix, they just haven't fixed it yet.   as for cost, well, he may be right, but the transition costs may be equal to that of better forms of power anyway, why switch to nuclear when you can get a deregulated solar system for approx the same price (complete conjecture, but it seems reasonable to me)    i think the core problem with all these traditional forms of power is that they rely on the same model: one big plant supplying power to many different people.  What seems to me to make more sense is that every household can find its own way of making power.  On this scale, renewable forms of energy (solar, wind, etc.) actually become quite efficatious.  While its almost impossible to make a solar plant that can supply power to an entire grid, apparently its quite easy and cheap (almost as cheap as oil, even with transition costs) and much cleaner, to do it for a single household.    note there will still be large power plants, not everyone will install their own solar pannels or build their own windtowers, but with the elimination of the need to supply power to those who will, the supply of electricity will go up, causing the price to go down, and a new market equillibrium will be reached.    by the way, don't let the deregulation travesty of california confuse you, it was just done poorly there, that's not to say that deregulation can't be done right.  in point of fact, the dereg. done in california was actually quite half-assed and it was the fact that the utility companies faught it tooth and nail that caused much of the power crisis in cali. . . . if you could just fiat deregulation, in theory it will be a much better system.

						   Rummy's loosing it, as evidenced by  urlLink  this NYTIMES article  . . . .  it seems our leaders are suffering from 'le estat ce moi' (pardon my french) symdrome: In a move reminicent of McCarthy,  Rummy implies that anyone who disagrees with the administration is in favor of the terrorists.  ABSOLUTELY FRIGGEN' ABSURD!    Do I disagree with the war on terror?  no.  Do I think that the U.S. should back out of its obligations to statebuild in Iraq and Afganistan? no.  Do I think that the United States is making a big mistake   in the way its fulfilling   those obligations? a big fat   Y E S!    does that make me unpatriotic?  nope, in fact, its part of our countries ideology that the most patriotic people diagree with government, openly and vocally.  that's what freedom of speech means.    As for Rummy's immediate claim that critics are making life difficult for the military to fight terror, a few responses: 1) you did that all by yourself by failing to rebuild adequate statebuilding institutions in Iraq and Afganistan.    2) Its kind of a Chicken and the Egg situation, Rummy, you don't need any critics at home to give the impression that we're slacking on our obligations-- WE ARE SLACKING ON OUR OBLIGATIONS. if you did send in the governmental support that Iraq needs, you wouldn't have so many critics stateside.    3) I really think you're looking in the wrong place for the criticizm. . . Americans are critical of the way you've been handling things, but MORE IMPORTANTLY, the Iraqi people are critical of you.  that's the bigger threat to American Security.  if you gave them the support they're asking for, you wouldn't have flocks of Iraqis joining up with Al Queda and other terrorist organizations.    so I'll make a deal with you.  Do it right and i won't complain, at least about that.   but don't tell me to sit quietly while you mess up in the middle east.  ok?

						   Julian, just to add to your remarks about the 'new' conservatism (which GWB calls 'compassionate conservatism'-- a name which, if recent policies show, is at best a misnomer and at worst a joke).    Think about it this way, most pro-Bush people, when questioned about his . . . ahem. . . questionable intellect, say, either 1) he's not   that   dumb (somewhat damning with faint praise) or 2) he surrounds himself with smart people.  its this second answer that, i think, has caused much of the falling off of 'smaller government' policies in the right. Typically republicans and the right has been in favor of strong executive control; administration of the largest superpower requires either a massive beauracracy or a powerful French-style executive.  notice the either/or nature of that statement, and GWB can hardly be called a strong executive.  Whenever faced with a difficult question, he defers to his advisors.  look at some of the personalities in his government, Rummy, Powell, Rice, even the VP, are all big power-brokers and strong influences.    a recent example: when he was questioned about his economic recovery package and the rise of unemployment, GWB created the new Job Czar position.  This from the party that opposed a national Dept. of Ed.   Or how about the new Homeland Security people.  Ironically, it seems that GWB has done more to enlarge government than Clinton ever did.    as for fiscal responsibility, well, it depends largely on your view of 'voodoo economics,' but seems to me that the numbers speak for themselves.  While increasing spending during a time of conflict seems appropriate, isn't it ironic that someone who inherited a budget surplus would now have a deficit, especially given the fact of his party?  given all this, the scism between Libertarians and the Right seems inevitable.   but what, the left and libertarians now have in common:  common opposition to the Patriot act.  that seems about it.  the Left is, typically, in favor of subsidies (partiuclarly farm subsidies) and government interferance in the economy.  the left is rypically in favor of income redistribution through taxes.  the left is typically for larger government;  all are no-nos for libertarians.  perhaps a better way of putting it is that there always were 3 distinct groups, the right, the left and the libertarians; and after a long time of being allied with the right, the libertarians are now jumping ship (even the rats jumped off the luisitania).  this, of course, is not to say that Libertarians are rats-- only that bush's Compassionate conservatism has failed just as asuradly as his presidency will.

						   So  urlLink  Patrick   outlines a really interesting project about creating node-diagrames for language. . . in effect, mapping out what the least number of words necessary to define all other words of that particular language.  I recommend reading his post, as he explains it much better than i just did.  according to many Semioticists (Umberto Eco, et al.) language does, in fact, inform the way we think. if it turns out that language is just one gigantic loop of reflexive defitions,(or as patrick puts it, "words are in cycles of some kind") does that mean that novelty is impossible?  consider an concept X.  X has no relation to any other idea ever before thought-- it is completely novel.   How would it fit into you're language-node diagram?  does this just mean we've made up a new word?  or can there be sections of language that are completely disconnected?  Or perhaps X would just turn out to be gibberish and not 'really' a concept at all.   just an interesting side note.  (from patrick) -What is the size of the min-word-set in English? 100 words? 1000 words? 10,000 words?    According to George Carlin, 7.  (from patrick) Is there any interesting variation between the respective min-word-sets of different languages? (i.e. is Japanese really full of more fundamental concepts than English?)    I would imagine the variation will be culturally relative. . . for example, Inuits have 34 different words for snow, and each corresponds to a different concept of snow--- light snow, heavy snow, snow falling, etc. while the inuits would probably consider each one a different 'concept,' we probably will think of it as 1, with differing adjectives/adverbs/prepositions attached.  (from patrick) - Are the actual fundamental words any different between languages? (If so, does this imply that either (a) languages need to have the same universal concepts to be Turning-complete, or that (b) the same set of fundamental concepts are hard wired into our brains.)  I would assume that when you do map out this language-node diagram, you will find a few fundamental concepts that are analytical a-priori to language.  for example, I'm sure that something like the word "language" is a fundamental concept-- that any society that communicates also understands that it is communicating.    the more interesting part of your question is more that are there words that aren't bound in the definition of language, but appear in every language nonetheless (i.e. the synthetic a priori words)  Assume that every language group in the world has a word for 'ass': pooper, shitter, etc. . .   there's nothing analytcial that would reveal this to be true, but it is nonetheless.    This might be a neat new way to prove that Synthetic A Priori truths DO exist. . . when we map out the node-diagram of all languages, there are things that 'need' to be in languages for a language to be a language, but are nonetheless not wrapped up in the definition of 'language' (in the way that 'funny' is wrapped up in 'joke').    congratulations patrick--- Kant applaudes you.

						   so while i'm on the logic puzzle kick. . . here's one from my Logic 100 class, my senior year (its actually several parts long, so bear with it.)  You are in hell.  it is painful and satan routinely anally rapes you with a big burning pitchfork while you are gagged with poo.  one day, satan comes to you and says, "i will let you out of hell if you can guess the number i am thinking of. you may guess 1 number a day, and you have as many guesses as you want. and what's more, you can even tell me which set of numbers i can use, so long as that set, itself, is infinite."    so what's the strategy you should use to guess in order to get out of hell in a finite number of days if. . .   1) the number is a whole positive number 2) the number is a whole number 3) the number is a rational number 4) the number is in the set of all reals 5) the number can be real or imaginary but cannot be a nonrepeting, infinite decemal.  and knowing each of those, which set of numbers (from those above) should you tell Satan to use, assuming, of course, that you don't like the poo-gagged rape. (hey some folk are into some   strange   stuff).  this was, in fact, a question on the Logic 100 final exam, as i recall it. (it was, of course, 3 years ago.)

						   Logic games 101:  Mikey posed this to Pat, Emanuel and I at smith, and we have yet to find an answer:  The warden meets with 23 new prisoners when they arrive. He tells them, "You may meet today and plan a strategy. But after today, you will be in isolated cells and will have no communication with one another.   "In the prison is a switch room, which contains two light switches labeled A and B, each of which can be in either the 'on' or the 'off' position. I am not telling you their present positions. The switches are not connected to anything.   "After today, from time to time whenever I feel so inclined, I will select one prisoner at random and escort him to the switch room. This prisoner will select one of the two switches and reverse its position. He must move one, but only one of the switches. He can't move both but he can't move none either. Then he'll be led back to his cell.   "No one else will enter the switch room until I lead the next prisoner there, and he'll be instructed to do the same thing. I'm going to choose prisoners at random. I may choose the same guy three times in a row, or I may jump around and come back.   " But, given enough time, everyone will eventually visit the switch room as many times as everyone else . (update: god damn mikey left this part out, which is what made the game so damn difficult.--- with this correction, its still challenging, but possible.)  At any time anyone of you may declare to me, 'We have all visited the switch room.' and be 100% > sure.   "If it is true, then you will all be set free. If it is false, and somebody has not yet visited the switch room, you will be fed to the alligators."   What is the strategy they come up with so that they can be free?    any takers?

						    urlLink Emanuel , my now 1 month roommate, was telling me about his unified theory of everything and anything this weekend, over a cup of coffee on our balcony.  I must admit it is intruiging. . . although i also must admit that much still needs to be explained.  This will be the first of a series of posts on the subject.  partly because it is a very interesting idea (even iof  the core of the theory revolves around the idea of self-reference, and it views pretty much everything else as an extention of that: the halting problem, free rider problems, communal costs etc. . . are all some version of self-referential behavior on some level.  I want to start with the halting problem, which E explains as follows:  "Basically, for complex machines (or programs), there is no way to say "this machine will definitely find a solution (or prove there is none), given this input x". But it turns out that a lot of problems are worse than non-solvable: we don't even know if they're non-solvable! So we can keep chugging forever, until we (a) find something or (b) give up. The search is never proven futile."  This is a very key problem that Emanuel's self-reference theory seems to create a way out of, or at least explains why it exists/not so terrible a problem.  this seems like a technical verson of "no negative proofs" to me. that is to say that its very difficult to prove something  doesn't   exist (although there are some ways to do it indirectly:  prove that ~x exists, and x and ~x can't exist simultaneously, therefore x doesn't exist and so on.)  epistomologically, the existence of the halting problem proves something very important: that we can never know everything.  in fact, if we apply the halting problem to epistomological omnipotence, it still works:  we'll never know if we can know everything, and hence we can never know everything.  this seems to be something like what emanuel is talking about with self-reference.  am I starting to get an inkling of what you're talking about? Kings to you, E.

						   With a clarification of Sep's position, i widthdraw my earlier comments, Unikow was just wrong.   turns out that Sep wasn't arguing for a solely action based legal system, but that actions ALSO matter.  to which unikow responds with "luck shouldn't matter at all. actions may be affected by luck, therefore actions shouldn't matter."  (simplification, see Unikow's full post on the matter.)   enough has been said on that.   there is still a raging blog war in the comments on my "under god" statement below.  i will leave that in the comments area.  what I do want to comment more on is Sep's question, " People often try to score points in arguments by calling others' positions "extremist" -- not just "wrong", but "extremist". I was thinking -- is it possible to label a position as extremist without privileging some other position or set of positions? That is, is extremism a "natural kind" that "carves nature at its joints", independently of our social practices and assumptions?"  To some extent, Sep's unstated (but i think inferred) proposition is right you can't really call something 'extremist' without privileging some other position. . . Extreme is a relative term, saying that its "far out beyond something else." nothing is extreme by itself.  so you clearly need something to compare it to.  however, calling something extreme also infers that it is neglecting other factors which might moderate it.  the idea of "a golden mean" may still be a nice idea, but its not really analysis. . . after all, "morality" may be the extreme of "minimally decent."  that does not make it a bad thing.  therefore, i shall try to avoid calling an argument "extremist" without providing further analysis.

						   in deference to this  urlLink case being brought in the supreme court , I thought i would post my thoughts about "one nation under god."  please note: i hate prayer in school.  I am a big believer in separation of church and state.  that said, I think the case is bunk.  "one nation under god," and "in god we trust," used to be exemplars of how government can tip its hat to religion without violating the free establishment clause, but now its being challenged.  There is a difference between the legal, nondenominational god that the supreme court, and the joint sessions of congress, open their sessions with, the same god invoked in "One Nation under God," and "In God we Trust."  and the religious god of church/synagogue/mosque/whatever.  One nation under god, as the NYTimes points out, was added to separate the United States from communism-- something that, despite the fall of the threat of communism, is still an applicable lesson and something that the United States should mantain.  Its symbolic of the fact that a regime of the Law and laws always understands that human beings are not just animalistic creatures which happen to have more capability than monkeys-- that there is a qualitative difference between the ability of animals to utter sounds and the ability of Humans to reason. . . that there is something (for lack of a better word) divine about human beings that other animals lack. regardless of what religion you are, it seems a good belief for a government to hold.  .  . in fact, i would say, it is one of the most important values a government can espouse.   and it holds true even if you don't believe in any god at all.

						   Finally, Segal doesn't respond to why I think Clark could be worse than Bush, since he fails to engage the argument that even if Clark's actions are better than Bush's, he will have fewer watchdogs & more sweeping support, thus creating the perspective that the Democratic Party can also be militaristic & gun-toting.  Sure, he could beat Bush, but he would do that by more or less being Bush.    i failed to engage the argument because I think engaging it would give it some form of credibility.    seriously, this is an APDA argument that doesn't have any value in the real world.   do you honestly think that people will say, "well, let's let the president do whatever he wants, because he's a democrat."

						   so there's been a bit of a war going on between  urlLink Sepdawg   and  urlLink  adam   I think they're both wrong.  or rather, they're both partially right.  Sep writes, "Fair treatment under the law doesn't mean punishing people equally for equally wrong acts. It means subjecting people to equal prospects of punishment for the results of their acts, even if those results are matters of luck."  and he gives the example:   Person A forms the intention to shoot person B, pulls the trigger, and shoots him. Sans excuse or justification, A is going away for a long time. Person C forms the intention to shoot person D and is about to shoot him, but a fly lands on his nose at the last moment, which distracts him. He cools down a bit and never shoots D. Person C will receive little if any punishment. It seems as though it's a matter of luck whether a fly lands on your nose.   Adam comes back with "intention based justice," saying "The obvious answer is that we can't prove that someone formed the intention of murdering their friend, if they changed their mind at the last moment. Lots of people get angry for a minute, plan something horrible, and then cool off; it seems that these people should be punished less than actual murderers. But if you had some kind of perfect, Minority Report-style oracle that could definitively prove that someone was about to murder someone else, and stopped the murder right before it happened, it seems totally reasonable to treat that as murder in the justice system. "  Well, Sep is wrong because Intent is important, especially for murder.  Adam is wrong because actions are also important, especially for murder.  this is why there is both Mens Rea (which i always thought sounded like some sort of intestinal dysfunction) and actus rheus--- both the criminal mind AND the criminal act.  both are part of an actual crime.  there are some crimes of intent, and some crimes of action--- and for the most part there are pretty good distinctions between the two (attempted murder MAY BE an exception, i'll leave the jury out on that, pardon the pun)  This is also why Adam's example of "if I run a stop sign and someone dies as a result, my crime is identical to the intentional act of murder, which seems undesirable." fails.  no Adam, you might be guilty of Manslaughter or negligent murder, or some other non-murder crime, but not murder-- there is no mens rea.  Because both act and intention are importnat, the question of luck becomes less important.  While luck may affect the action, there's no way that "i am just that kind of unlucky that I have these murderous feelings towards someone."  the Intention does check the luck aspect.  while at the same time, we don't want to punish people for thinking "i'd really like to kill that swine."  2 parts, both needed for criminal sanction.   typically false dichotomies can make for many good debate cases.  but in this case, the false dichotmy between "intention," and "action," as the basis for law really does not.

						   i received this email last night:   Ann Coulter reportedly objects to having her religion singled out as unacceptable for display of religious icon, and you offer the following:  "A school might want to, oh say, prevent any possiblity of someone bringing up a religious lawsuit by precluding ALL RELIGIOUS COMMENTS within the confines of the school? might that seem reasonable, huh?"  Reasonable?  I can see the line of thinking,  but you however, have failed to even read what you wrote.  There's the assertion that "ALL RELIGIOUS COMMENTS" being removed from schools is a legal protection for the schools. But ALL were not removed. Just hers. Others, according to your own quotation, were allowed.  Which is more than an interesting event at the very least, and certainly significant for the New York political and cultural environments.   And you give credibility to Ms. Coulter's point about her Faith's Founder being unusually hated.  While you cite that New York reportedly allowed Jewish and Islamic displays, "violating" that revered legal protection, there is not a murmur of concern regarding that those breaches which DID occur. But look at all the vociferous prattle about Ms. Coulter's desire to be given equal standing, which did not occur!  Such anger about a non-event,  while real events which you assert would be a legal threat to the schools, go by with no comment.  If the situation were reversed and Islamic displays were forbidden but Christian ones allowed, you do not come across as someone who would brush it off as "ISOLATED incidents of  discrimination" and simply "unfortunate". But for HER, well that's fine for her ilk, right?  Clearly Ms. Coulter's voicing objection at second rate treatment inspires a hypocritical, and spiteful response, demonstrated by the absent logic and hate-speak that surrounds the commentary about Coulter's complaint.  Examine your heart. Your hate is affecting your mind and robbing you of clarity.  The real point that you appear to wish to make here is to clarify and defend the Islamic heart.   Coulter accepts that the terrorists of the Tower acted for Islam and therefore, their work stands as a memorial to Islam, desired or not. Hard ideas, but she is not on thin ice. Like The Crusaders, they did claim to die for their god, whether the Islamic faithful acknowledge and embrace them, or not. They were not alone in their glee that thousands of innocents died that morning.  Sadly, a rational response to this statement is needed, but denunciations of their actions from the Islamic community are not  in ready supply. Perhaps the media is to blame. Post 9-11, with a few exceptions, the Islamic storylines were essentially, "Don't hate us because they did that."  Given the volume of "don't hate us" stories so sympathetically given by the media, it is hard to imagine that the  press censored Islamics speaking out against the notion of the terrorists as representatives of their faith. It would have supported the press angle of non-discrimination.  But here, given the opportunity to reinforce a distance between irrational hate and Islam, you opt instead to slam Coulter's faith more than defend Islam and in a most offensive, ungodly manner. I stake my life upon the fact that if Ann flew a plane into a Saudi mall and killed innocents in the name of Jesus, Christians would denounce her repeatedly, publically and unequivocally, and that their chief concern would not be to be fearful that Islamics would hate them for her act.   Your attacks on her valid points reguarding discrimination would rightfully send faithful Islamics distancing themselves from you, as they ought also to distance themselves from their "fellow" believers who killed themselves at the Towers that day. Just as those madmen have done nothing for Islam, so has this diatribe.  Her group was discriminated against. In this country, that's a basic no-no.  Whether you like them 2000 years from now,  or not.   in response, I shall mock the person (whom i shall affectionaly refer to as Ditto herein) with a delightful blend of actual analsis and humorous Ad Homenim attacks.  Here we go:  1) Coulter does not want equal protection.  show me where she does.  Her concern is that the christianity which she takes as dogma isn't being given preferential treatment over the 'lesser' faiths.  I decry THAT as hypocrasy--that is what makes Coulter a hemorrhodial breach in the fabric of intellectualism.  The schools involved refused to teach any religion as doctrine, but rather wished to teach that which the students do not know: the tennents of Islam, Judism et. al.  both of which are rich traditions in their own right.  people know Christianity, they don't know about other cultures.  teaching THOSE is important, especially given your obvious concern about "hate speech."  but the school does not teach that "Allah is God," or even "Jesus was not."  what the school does is teach about islam, not preach islam.  no problem with that from me.  2)  Christ, unusually hated?  what? Ditto, you are silly.   Jews are unusally hated, Muslims are unusually hated, Blacks and Hispanics are unusually hated.  Christians?  Also, Coulter Absurdtion (combination of the words absurd and assertion) that christ's popularity has any relation to his divinity is the type of stupidity i would expect from someone with less than a third grade education, and whose family tree resembles the one of the kid on the stoop from deliverance.  3)  Clearly Ms. Coulter's voicing objection at second rate treatment inspires a hypocritical, and spiteful response, demonstrated by the absent logic and hate-speak that surrounds the commentary about Coulter's complaint.  Examine your heart. Your hate is affecting your mind and robbing you of clarity.    You say i am "hate filled," and I am "robbed of clarity by my unclear heart."  i say Coulter is a craptacular waste of cells, better suited for ameobic dysentery than for political commentary.  both are ad homenim attacks.  mine are funny.  4) Ditto, you are right that my main point is about the fact that the average muslim, in America or abroad, isn't a terrorist, but a decent hardworking person that wants nothing more but to live his/her life free from being bombed or starved because people who they have never heard of decided to go to war.   but you disagree, seemingly to go along with Coulter's rectal wart fluid, that says that ALL OF ISLAM SHOULD BE BLAMED FOR THE ACTIONS OF A FEW.  Do you really want that as a principle?  Should I hold you accountable for everything done by the actions of your forbears?  Regretably, i know little of you, so i cannot make more infuriating racial/ethnic slurs about you here, but rest assured that every ethnic group has done some really bad shit to another ethnic group.   5) Given the tendancy of Baby-Bush administration to "bomb first, ask questions later," It seems quite reasonable to me for the islamic community around the world to say, "don't hate us."  inevitably, someone was going to be bombed for the actions of 9-11, and perhaps rightfully so, but the muslims didn't know who.  seems safe to say soothing things to the nuclear weapon wielding barbarians at your gate.  6) yes, i slam Coulter's faith.  I slam every faith.  I am an equal opportunity slammer--- also known as an Asshole.   nothing wrong with that.  I revel in my assholic nature, it gives me strength to deal with the 10-pounds-of-bullshit-in-a-5-pound-bag that is the political landscape of America.   I am jaded and cynical.  but i am also funny. I believe that humor is the only thin blue collar line seperating our society from a complete fuck-you anarchy.  we've given up on civilty, so be it.  I shall take sass to the sassless.  Does that make me ungodly?  well, uncivil, but ungodly?  as for muslims distancing themselves from me?  meh, i call it like i see it.  if that pisses off some people, so be it.  In fact, the more people who I piss off, the better.    7) I stake my life upon the fact that if Ann flew a plane into a Saudi mall and killed innocents in the name of Jesus, Christians would denounce her repeatedly, publically and unequivocally, and that their chief concern would not be to be fearful that Islamics would hate them for her act.    all this statement proves is that Coulter does not have a monopoly on mere assertion. Saying "i stake my life on the fact . . " is only hyperboleic language, with no real backing.     Further, the fear of reprisals from angry victims is, in fact, a real concern--- look at Israel and the Palestinians.  when Palestinians attack Israel, the Israeli's strike back, hard and swift, and don't always get the right people.  Palenstinians return fire, often in the form of suicide bombings-- thus injuring more innocents.  Again, it seems quite reasonable and rational to say, "i was not part of the group responsible for X, so don't bomb me when you counterattack."  see that last paragraph, Ditto?  that's what we like to call analysis.  Learn it, love it, use it.   what has my "diatribe," as you call it accomplished?  well, probably not much.  but i never went into the 'blogging' industry to do much either.  perhaps it made me feel better to mock someone as haltingly and galactically stupid as Coulter.  perhaps i may have contributed in some small way to the general din of the internet.  perhaps I have done nothing at all.  but hey, Blogger's a free service so I shall continue to list my "diatribes," without any thought to the way it might affect anyone else.  such is my right.   you may not agree with my particular blend of humor, so don't read my blog.  such is your right.

						   surprise of California wasn't that Arnold was 1st, but that Porn Star Mary Cary was 10th, with 9,000+ votes.  who are these 9000+ people who thought that the best person to vote for is a PORNO STAR?   urlLink complete results   I also feel bad for Todd Richard Lewis who came in last with 170 votes.  I know nothing of Mr. Lewis, but I'm sure he'd probably do a better job than Ms. Cary.  in other news: I've been having these really guilty feelings about supporting the BoSox, despite my Yankee upringing.    Part of it the history-- everyone loves the underdog, but part of its the excitement of Boston--- its hard not to cheer along with a bunch of other people Cheering on Wakefield, or Lowe, or Martinez.    Despite an amazingly even matchup (this season the Yankees won 10 and lost 9 to the sox.)  there still is an advantage that Boston has, the advantage of expectation.  If the Yanks lose, they've upset what New York sees as the natural order and the Sox have ended Bambino's Curse. but if the Sox lose, its just another year, another incident of "the Curse."  no one will remember it any othe way.  it seems that the Sox have nothing to lose and everything to gain-- not only an advantageous position, but one that carries a romanticism that's hard to ignore.

						     Linking The Unexamined was Definately Unexpected  :   The Unexamined Life is linked on the  urlLink Clark-o-sphere     So as a result of my comments to Storey (see below), I have been linked on a particularly well known Pro-Clark Blog,  urlLink http://www.draftclark.com/   wow.  Its strangely honoring to know that someone out there who isn't apda or amherst or 'friend-o-mine' related who reads the general ranting and raving that is this site.  well, in honor of that, i think a few words on why I support Clark are in order.  First of all, I should say that I really dig the way he was "convinced" to run;  I really think Nader did a disservice to grassroots organizing with the xpirgs (which are neither public interest, nor research groups, but that's a seperate post altogether).  And its heartening to see such a massive movement seemingly come out of nowhere to call on someone to run for President.  Its also heartening that, in essence, the people would go to Clark, rather than the other way around.  I really think that's a part of the charisma of Clark, that he didn't originally seek office, but that the massive movement to get him to run changed his mind.    Secondly, I think he's got the right proposals and issues.  Pro Choice, Anti-Bush Tax cut, and many others i agree with.  I'm not going to get into that here, because I think there's plenty of that on the web, and people who are much more eloquent about the issues than I am.  Suffice to say that Clark is suffiecnetly Left-of-center to suit my tastes without going too far.  -- and for a Military man (military people empirically tend to lean to the right) that's impressive.  Third, he's smart, which is somthing we SHOULD LOOK FOR IN OUR PRESIDENT!  a Rhodes Scholar, a West Point Grad (very impressive).  Here's a few links i got off of the aforelinked Wes Clark for Prez site that link speeches and articles Clark has given:  urlLink An Army of One    urlLink Special Address to NATO   both of those show some really interesting and insightful analysis-- something that our current administration of Baby Bush is quite lacking. Plus he has a long history of service with his generalship, and that's something that definately demands respect, even if you don't support Clark, he has already done quite a bit for America.  Fourth, I think he can win!--- look, Bush's tactics so far have been to decry everyone and anyone who doesn't agree with his policies as "unpatriotic," or "unamerican," or even "Pro-terrorist."  TRIPE!  but it'll be quite difficult for him to do this to Clark, "you are Unamerican, mr. Former Supreme NATO Commander!"  just sounds Oxymoronic, but then again, Bush tends to be a bit of that, minus the Oxy.  People on the center-left and far-left have endorsed Clark, showing his ability to solidify the party, and keep the ever-important swing voters "riding the donkey."    So that's a bit more analysis on Clark than i gave before.  any questions?

						   Today is Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the jewish year; so i thought a post on religion was in order, and after the third person to say to me, "YOU'RE JEWISH?" i thought i would post my thoughts on religion and yom kippur in particular:  First of all, I would like to follow the example of many of my jewish friends and appologize for any wrongdoing i have done to all of you, or any of you.   Yom Kippur is a day of atonement, where we ask forgiveness for our sins over the course of the year; something important, I think, for anyone to do.  It's a day that reminds us that we're not perfect no matter how big our egos get, on occasion.  It also forces us think about our mortality; that some day we will die, and even if you don't believe in an afterlife judgment, its still important to consider what type of legacy we will leave behind.   I'll admit that i'm not the most religious person, although i do believe in God, and I do count myself a spiritual person.  I usually only go to temple once a year, if that, on Yom Kippur, and I did go this year.   But some of my  urlLink friends  often question the existence of God, and the need for religion at all.  First of all, i think everyone really does believe in a higher power, even if 1) they don't call it God or 2) don't admit it to themselves.  God need not be an anthropomophized sentient being that most organized religions claim-- the typical old white guy with a flowing robes and long white 'gandalf' style beard.  A conception of God as Truth, or Morality, or some other abstraction is just as valid; in fact i think that's more what God is-- the ideal of perfection or more accurately, that which humanity should strive for.  That ideal is not only good to believe in, i think it might be necessary for any sort of moral system.  If morality or perfection, or whatever,  isn't that which we strive to acheive, why be moral at all?  I think of this as the strong version of the teleological argument for God.  People who claim that there is no god and that the rules of physics and nature govern all, are simply substituting a different conception of God for the judeochristian one.  saying that is just as much a leap of faith as saying "allah is god," or "buddha is god" or even "Zeus is god."  both make claims about that which we do not, and can not possibly, know.  Science is, indeed verifiable, but only through the lense of science itself, in Cartesian circle-style, just like Religion is verifiable through its own lense.    Of course, i'd be a madman to say that science and religion are equally valid-- within its own paradigm, Science is based on logic and hypothoses verified by experimentation.  Religion, however, is based on revalation and is completely unaccessable to anyone outside of the revalations of that particular sept.    still, the end of both science and religion, and even philosophy are the same; they're all the search for Truth.   What I think is important to God is that we search for that Truth--- that is to say its the search that matters, not whether or not we acheive it, and in fact very few, if any at all, of us do eventually acheive it.    which brings the question, if what God cares about is the search, throught whatever paradigm, why build a religion around faith? and more importantly, does religion hold any value?  This is a much harder question to answer. . . but the answer is part of the reason why I still consider myself "jewish," rather than "nondenominational."  So much of our lives, especially in America, is based on the individual.  we have individual rights, which Marx explained end up separating us from each other. And to some extent he was right about that.  we think of ourselves as independent agents which separated from one another, act in our own ways.  But community is just as important, if not more important because of that.    When I went to services last night, I can definately feel a connection with Jews around the world, saying the same prayers, feeling the same things.  that's a community, and that's something special.  Its also a feeling of being part of a community throughout time-- that its a tradition that has existed for literally thousands of years (5 thousand if religious records are correct.)  and that's something impressive to be a part of too.    More in particular the Jewish faith is something that I am proud to be a part of.  We are a group that has been discriminated against by everyone-- and I'm not going to get into a "we were discriminated against more than you" debate with anyone. . . but suffice to say that many many people have tried to wipe us out, and every time, Jews are able to survive with a grim determination.  We were slaves in Egypt, we were slaves in Greece and Rome, and from Masada to the Holocaust, from the Greeks to the Soviets, everyone has hated the jews, but every generation we're able to survive.  That's also something I want to identify with.

						   Storey, despite much of your intelligence, sometimes you can say some really stupid things.   Wes Clark and George Bush?  are you out of your mind?   here's what storey says about  urlLink Clark   a couple of reasons why, without getting into the specifics of Clark's politics (i'll do that later in this post), Clark is better than Bush  1) Clark may have gone to war with Iraq--- and you and I have clashed on that issue before, but he sure as hell would have been better in hte post war administration. He's done it before, he did a pretty good job of it in Kosovo, which has become relatively stable.   2) Its sort of unnerving to call him a fascist, right, like he's not going to take over and start calling himself "der Furor."  but if you mean that he's Ashcroftian?  well your wrong there too.  he's been an avid oppnent of many of Bush's more . . . uh. . . creative policies including the Patriot act.. . if you've seen him on MSNBC, you'd know that he's very often critical of the government for being too intrusive into rights.  for example, on MSNBC, Clark the following (cut and pasted from a pro-clark  urlLink blog .) He said the administration entered office determined to wage war with Iraq and seized on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks for justification. He accused the administration of violating principles of American democracy.  "This administration is trying to do something that ought to be politically impossible to do in a democracy, and that is to govern against the will of the majority," he said. "That requires twisted facts, silence, secrecy, and very poor lighting. Thats why you need night-vision goggles to see whats going on over there."   3) he's quite smart.  he was a Rhodes Scholar, graduated top of his class at West Point.  . . consider the last Rhodes Scholar we elected---- William "Mother lovin'-big pimpin" Clinton.  nuff said.  also, let's look at his politics, they are quite liberal, even if they are conservative for YOU, storey, but then again, you'd have to look right to see Karl Marx.   from " urlLink  (updated: not the campaign blog, but an unofficial pro-clark site) a wes clark campaign blog ": 1. Clark is economically progressive: His first major initiative will be to create jobs by very targetted tax credits, help states pay for additional security, and bolster education funding. He would pay this by rolling back upper income tax breaks passed by Bush.  2. Clark is a believer in civil liberties: he is pro-choice, he would review the Patriot Act to remove overly broad provisions, he would protect access to the ballot box and court system.  3. Clark is an internationalist: he would live up to our treaty obligations, expand trade, expand contacts around the world, and work through international institutions by effective diplomacy.  4. Clark is a patriot: and believes that patriotism requires speaking out, involvement and action. He believes that dissent is not disloyalty.  5. Clark is a doer: with administrative experience to get things done, and form teams that will get things done.

						   Lately i've been ranting and sassing various public figures, and while Ann Coulter and Maureen Dowd, both of whom set the cause of womens liberation back at least sixty years by showing why  some women, at least don't deserve the right to life, let alone the right to vote.  but sassing aside, i'd like to take a moment to comment on a more philosophical level about julian sanchez.  well, less about  urlLink Julian , and more about his recent article in  urlLink Reason .  Read the article.  I find it-- and the linked articles its based on really interesting.    First of all, Julian has posted on the topic of generational political trends before and i enjoyed the earlier posts (i couldn't find them with a cursory search, so look a little yourself, they're neat.)  but i do, surprise surprise, have a few comments to make.  1) "A May article in The New York Times Magazineone whose author will doubtless burn in one of hell's warmer and more feces-filled concentric circles for coining the term "Young Hipublicans"claimed that conservatism is becoming mainstream on American college campuses. In a recent American Conservative editorial, Gavin McInnis, right-leaning editor of the painfully cool magazine Vice, spotted the same trend even among his core audience of Williamsburg hipsters. " I submit to you, reader, that anyone who has said this has not been to any small liberal arts colleges recently.  but those articles julian sites, being done with 'good scientific method,' i'm sure (sarcasm sarcasm) i shall give them their due attention.  That aside for a moment, Julian clearly defines the two generations:  "In a dramatic departure from the cynicism of their Xer forebears, Millennials harbor a great deal of trust in government, hardly indicative of a conservative sensibility. Scott Beale, author of Millennial Manifesto, attributes this in part to the political scandals that shaped Xers and Millennials respectively. While the children of the 60s and 70s recall Watergate and Iran-Contrascandals involving institutional abuse of powersay "scandal" to 80s babies and they're likely to think of the furor over an intern's position on the presidential staff. "Millennials," says Beale, "might look at politics and say 'these people suck,' whereas Gen Xers were more likely to say 'Man, these people suck and the system sucks.'"  cool.  but where i disagree with Sanchez is when he goes on to say that this is a 'conservative' trend.  In fact, he so far as to quote a prof. in texas who says this is ""hypercommunitarianism" as "fascism in youth culture.""  This is where he loses me.    Look, there's a big difference between saying "The American System is good system," and saying "Deuschland uber allis."  American culture is, was, and will always remain one that has a strong emphasis on individuality and personal freedom.  Saying I "buy into" a system of rights that allows me to always critize the government, practice whatever religion i want without fear of governmental reprisal, associate or disassociate with whomever I chose is a long LONG way off of hypercommunitarianism or fascism.  maybe i'm not in tune with today's millenial youth, because i was born in 1980-- the strange no-man's land on the cusp of millenial and X generations.  is it fascist to have a belief in morality of our governmental system.  Ask Howard Dean if he thinks our government is a just system.  Ask Wes Clark, or any of the people running for the LIBERAL SIDE's candidacy.  I don't think they'll tell you that "only a neonazi would agree with that."    I really think what's happening is that -- and this is going to offend Julian a bit, my sorries in advance-- What Julian is lamenting is that the LIBERTARIAN Jihad of the gen Xers is passing, and what's replacing it is a return to the old 'dogmatics' of the American Founding. That's not a liberal or conservative thing.  its not a democratic or republican thing.  its a rational thing.   but Julian acknowledges this when he says, "Today's students bridle against the academic left's assault on America and American institutionsbut this is reactive nationalism, not conservatism. "  true dat, although i think it may just be plain old fashioned nationalism, nothing reactive about it. . . always remember there's a difference between nationalism and national socialism. (random quote: "say what you want about the tennets of national socialism, at least its an ethos" --Walter in The Big Lebowski-- just wanted to put that in there.)  But the opposite of Libertarianism isn't fascism or hypercommunitarianism.  Our government rules with the consent of the governed, it lets us govern ourselves.  while Julian may want MORE self-governance than is necessary, that's a seperate issue altogether.     However.  What i like in Juilian's piece is the treatment he gives to the breakdown of the traditional right/left.  he writes, "Since our central political metaphor is the left-right spectrum, a relic of the 18th century French Assembly that has been growing less relevant since the close of the Cold War, political trends that don't fit well into binary categories tend to be misidentified. Libertarians have long been accustomed to being labeled flaming liberals by conservatives and hardcore right-wingers by those on the left. "  its true. . . I think further evidence of this is religious right/conservative alliance--- typically the religious 'right' was quite far to the left--- meaning they were reactionaries, wanting greater governmental intrusion into schools and homes; its just that they wanted greater church intervention into government too.  That's typically a leftist issue.   In conclusion, i might simply say that its a mistake to label any generation--- that there are libertarians, liberals, conservatives in all ages.  but that's not really a surprise to anyone.   It also somewhat troubles me to start thinking about groups in terms of their environments--- its quite dismisive to say, "well, he/she only believes in X because of the times he/she grew up in."  and its dangerous to do so.  Its much better to take all ideas on face and analyize their contents than to examine the motives behind those ideas.  all in all, it was a very interesting and thought provoking piece.  Kudos, Julian.

						      urlLink The Three Bulldogs:   :   Guiliani, Sharon and Safire     William "Bulldog" Safire writes about the new 'great wall of Israel,' being built by Sharon in order to protect "passing schoolbusses from sniper-fire."  He points out that much of the controversy over the path of the wall is around the Israeli city, aptly named, Ariel.    Although I love Safire's always appropriate and insightful comments, this time he misses a rather large issue: ISRAEL SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BUILD A WALL.  if the nobel peace prize winning Arafat's continued support of suicide bombings have caused the Israeli state such disruption that it has to protect school children by building a multi million-- probably billion--- dollar barrier between the Israeli's and the Palestinians, isn't that a sign that he should never have gotten the nobel peace prize?  (I recall Rudi's actions several years ago when Arafat came to New York to receive his Nobel: at the reception, Guiliani was seated at the man's table; when Arafat arrived, Bulldog Guiliani rose to his feet, said, "I don't eat with murderers." and left.  I love New York. But that's just a side story. )   The Bush Administration has threatened to withhold a guarantee of several million if Sharon moves the wall to protect Ariel (the City).  First of all, Baby Bush's handling of the Middle east peace process has been sloppy, at best.  But this one takes the cake.  Damn you Sharon, Damn you for being forced to protect schoolchildren from snipers.

						   i had the oddest dream last night that i think bears repeating:  The dream was that Nick and I were hitting Angelo and Tim in an inround.  Angelo, being in the mob, and Tim, being obsessed with the mob, understandably ran the following case:  you are the leader of a small organized crime ring.  Do you focus your energy on your extortion (protection) racket, or your gun smuggling?  opp choice.  what made this round interesting was that it was judged by none other than the Teflon Don, himself, Jon Gotti.  Gotti, you may recall, died in jail a few years ago.    I have to say i have a lot of respect for Gotti; in the way Reagan had respect for the Nazis. . . which is to say, I admire his fortitude, and his gumption, but at the same time, I understand that he was just an evil man.    Beyond that, i also have to respect Sammy "The Bull" Gravano--- a guy who REFUSED protective custody. . . he sort of said, "if you want me, come and get me, 'cause i'm the baddest mofo around."  bad ass  who won the round, you might ask?  well, unfortunately the round was cut short by a hail of bullets as Roland, the Gunslinger, charged into the room to kill us all.  it's going to be an odd day.  also, a few days ago, i found this site that is, i swear, the inside of Patrick Nichols II's brain, put onto a website.   urlLink find it here

						    urlLink Ann Coulter  is the intellectual equivelent of a great big bleeding hemorrhoidal protrusion.    She points out that: "In New York City, the chancellor of the Department of Education prohibited the display of Nativity scenes in public schools, while expressly allowing the Jewish menorah and the Islamic star and crescent to be displayed. Some would say that was overkill inasmuch as New York City is already the home of the world's largest public display built in commemoration of Islam: Ground Zero."  appropriately, i just spoke about racism and humor.  (see below) ANN, what you just said is one of the biggest crapulence of a statement ever.  Ground Zero is not a "commemoration of Islam," Islam is actually a very complex religion that preaches many of the same values as christianity.  i guarantee you that no where in the Koran does it say "hijack airplanes and crash them into buildings."  september 11th was the act of evil men perverting a rich and beautiful tradition for their own ends.  In the absence of Islam, they would simply find themselves another gimmick to preach.    that said, everything else you say in your column, Ann, is an elephantine load of excrement, the likes of which could only come from inside your annorexic cranium.    for example: "There is no surer proof of Christ's divinity than that he is still so hated some 2000 years after his death" perhaps that means that in 2000 years, when you, assuradly are still hated, you will be revered as well.   what you have, inevitably, failed to do in your column, is see the issue from the school's point of view.  yes,  those ISOLATED incidents of PC-reverse discrimination are unfortunate, but we live in a time in which people sue McD's for making them fat.  A school might want to, oh say, prevent any possiblity of someone bringing up a religious lawsuit by precluding ALL RELIGIOUS COMMENTS within the confines of the school?  might that seem reasonable, huh?  Oh, by the way,  urlLink William F. Buckley -- the male verson of Ann Coulter-- let out this little S.B.D. of an argument:   But anti-rich talk is the bacon and eggs of Democratic camaraderie. Every now and then it exposes the witch doctors to a sharp little stab of thought. The lady interrogator, Gloria Borger, having heard all of the candidates declare that they would not want any new tax increases, asked them, How are you going to eliminate the tax cuts of 2001 without enacting tax increases? A nice point, but the candidates quickly, unanimously, swiftly decided to ignore it.  Huh? he's criticizing Dems for not being able to quickly undo the damage done by the horrendeously irresponsible bush tax cuts?  seems like a criticism of Bush to me.

						   MY FAVORITE PASTTIME IS BEATING UP GOTHS.  So i saw "Gothika" today.  although the company was good- and we had a helluva good time laughing at the movie- the movie was, quiite possibly, the worst movie ever made.   here's my point-by-point review:  by the way, i feel no shame in releasing virtually every single one of the predictable and stupid plot twists, because none of you should ever see this movie of crapulent crapiness.  1) Ok, so the ghost can possess people, but instead of possessing the murderer, it possesses the murder's wife to kill him.    2) Halle's character escapes from her assylum cell like 50 times in two days.  Is part of the ghost's powers to make Assylum security guards stupid?  3) while we're on the subject, during the middle of the final (of 50) breakouts, why did a security guard randomly give Halle the keys to his car?    4) why do these stupid security guards think its a suicide attempt when Halle is FLOATING THREE FEET ABOVE THE GROUND?!?  5) who designed this assylum, anyway?  Dr. Mengala would be creeped out. The place had cells which were about 6x6x6-- they seemed hardly bigger than my closet.  Dracula would feel clostrophobic in one of those coffins.   and the rest of the place was even creepier looking-- bordering on Giger-esque.  How, on earth, would anyone ever not go crazy in that place.  6)  Robert Downy Jr's character is completely irrelvent to any and all parts of the movie.  why is he there at all?  A few weeks ago, i thought that no movie could ever top Underworld for poor production value.  how wrong I was.  Gothika isn't just a shitty title, its a shitty movie.

						    urlLink  If only this would work on APDA   speaking of which, i hate the new Apda  urlLink Forum   here's a few reasons why:  1) buddy lists?  because AOL just isn't enough.  we need to be able to be in contact for realpolitik 24-7, from any java based interface.  2) the stars.  Social Status elevated to an artform.  We really did need a form of elitism based on web use.   Idea: let's have the stars say "juden" on them   furthermore:  I AM A DINO, DAMMIT. I worked 4 years, and I want the damn status.  3) polls.  Stupid people's opinions that i hate anyway need to form a larger part of my life.  the only good thing about the forum, which was good about the original forum anyway, was that it keeps my Email box from clogging with shitty political emails from people, most of which were whinny about how a tournament sucked because they didn't break.  oh, and why do i still read this colossal waste of time before the universal collapse?  well, ask yourself that before you're hard-up for judges and send me an email.    further note: the original design for the current incarnation of the APDA website was largely designed by Matt Stein.  he's quite a good web designer and should be credited for his work.  that's all i'm going to say on the matter.

						   So my first question about Lincoln's predicament (see previous post) is how to even evaulate such a question.  Lincoln, i think, would have probably said that his duty was to preserve the union, at whatever cost, but that's sort of less informative than what would  I  do in his place.  The numbers, on both sides seems so inscruitably large. . . how many people died in WWI, WWII, the holocaust, all the other attrocities that Churchill said would be avoided, vs all the slaves that would be saved, all the american lives that would be etc.  . .   what this seems to me to say is that a life for life, or even a wrong for wrong, calulous in this case fails.  first of all, there's something similar, in principle about slavery and murder. . . as Locke would say, "he who would take from me the fruits of my labor may not be assumed to stop, and would further take everything else from me."  (not  exact  quote but from my memory its something to that effect.)  point is that the dehumanization of slavery is in some sense morally equivelent to the removal of humanity inherent in murder.    Perhaps a good-for-good calulation:  well, that depends on the "goods" that came out of both sides. . .all very debatable-- the state of Israel (especially of late) is very contentious as a good outcome of WWII; at the same time Churchill's Pax Americana may or may not be morally better than a single state which outlawed slavery almost a generation earlier.  (is justice delayed justice denied?)    so then how can I decide between the two different realities.  I would say that the problem of 'dirty hands,' might apply, that if I do what I have sworn to do (that is, as president to protect and preserve the constitution) perhaps i'm less morally culpable for the outcomes of those actions.  (this would have been lincoln's argument, i suppose)      Perhaps what i'm pointing to is a counter example to  urlLink P.dawg's   usual claim that deep down, when the numbers get large enough everyone has a utilitarian streak-- and then giving some example of when one person's life is weighed against a million trillion (or 1*10^n lives, where n approaches infinity)  to prove his point.  well here's an example of somewhat equivelent numbers, huge on both sides, in which a utilitarian calculous doesn't seem appropriate.

						   I am now reading a great book called "what if", its a series of essays about military history which ask, what if certain battles had been decided the other way. . .   the most interesting one i've read so far was one i've actually read before for a class, written by Winston Churchill, about what if Pickett's charge had succeeded.  Pickett's charge, you'll recall, was a last, desperate attempt to flank the Union forces at gettysburg, which you'll further recall, was the turning point of the civil war.  Churchill argues that if the south wins the war, it still ends up (with Lee as successor to Jefferson Davis) abolishing slavery due to a boom in cotton prices in europe causing the south to rapidly industrify-- meaning slavery was no longer a necessary or viable part of their economy.  The new north/south American states form a Pax Americana which prevents the entaglements which cause WWI, which, in turn prevent National Socialism from errupting in Europe.    Churchill wrote the piece in mid 50s, and it might be argued that he was just trying to escape the realities of war-torn Europe, but assume he was correct.  further assume that Lincoln had this foresight.  what would you do in his place?  no WWII, no Holocaust, but at the price of Abolishing slavery for almost a generation and the Union destroyed. my thoughts on the matter are forthcomming.

						   Don't ask me why, but on the T to work this morning i was thinking about all the different nicknames for Justin Berkowitz that we've got, and when to use them. . . here's a few i came up with:  Berzerkowitz: if Justin goes crazy      Corollary, Berzerkofits: if justin ever has a conniption fit  Jerkowitz: when justin acts like a jerk  Merkowitz: when justin muddles (or Merks up) a round  Lurk-for-chicks: when justin is going after (or lurking for) chicks  Smirkowitz: when justin wins a round and is acting all smirky  Perkowitz: when justin wins a round just because he's friends with  the judge. (eg, he wins because of a perk)  tired-of-itz: when justin is angry because he is "sick and tired" of something (perhaps this joke)  Derkowitz: when justin takes the D line, even though you tell him to take the "B as in Berkowitz" line.  Convertowitz: if you hate justin, but then you start to like him, you become a convertowitz  similarly: Convictowitz: when/if justin does anything illegal or sketchy   anyone else?

						   Its been a little over a week since my last post, so here goes:  1) the new television/home entertainment system comes today.  sweetness.  for those out there who haven't spoken to me in the last few days, here's what it entails:  - 32" FLATSCREEN SONY WEGA - TOSHIBA DVD - 5 DISK CD CHANGER - PIONEER PRO-LOGIC RECEIVER WITH 5.1 SURROUND SOUND; 2000 WATT CAPACITY - 2001 VCR - 6 PIECE JENSEN SPEAKER SYSTEM (INCLUDES 200 WATT SUB-WOOFER)BLACK ASH - MONSTER CABLES, DEDICATED DIGITAL AUDIO-VIDEO CABLING READY TO HOOK-UP - MODERN MAPLE ENTERTAINMENT UNIT WITH LIGHTS, VIDEO/ DVD DRAWERS WITH  DOORS, BUILT IN GLASS SHELVING  24 will be playing on it tonight.  2) I have been on vacation for 4 days now, happiness;  i have spent 4 days in my pjs, watching daytime TV.  i miss it so.    3) Hanging out with the NYU team was soo much fun at brandeis this weekend.  AE is a funny girl, Neil is a great guy, Alex, Christian and Cannary are all great.  Shame that i won't get to seem them again until MIT-- if that.  Also, NYU has CNoty-- cool novice of the year-- in Karl.  4) Matty and Amanda came over last night, for some chit-chat, and Irish Hot Chocolate (meaning containing a silly ammount of ameretto and whiskey).  Matty proved to me exactly how bad a chess player Jerry must be, if i have usually beat him 3out of4 times.  Matty kicked my ass.  i want to learn how to play chess better.

						    urlLink   AHHHHHHHHH    (Jordan goes SSJ2 on Coulter)  so several months go by and "ditto" has not responded.  so I thought i would throw the gauntlet down again, see if she takes the bait.  Did I mention i've got worlds of hate on for the late Ann Coulter.  oh wait, she's not dead, just her sanity is.  I never thought anyone would anger me more than Maureen "down syndrome" Dowd.  but along comes Ann "why you should watch afterschool specials about anorexia" Coulter.  I am angered.  a few pearls of wisdom from the crazy bitch:  "Liberals have a preternatural gift for striking a position on the side of treason. You could be talking about Scrabble and they would instantly leap to the anti-American position. Everyone says liberals love America, too. No they dont. Whenever the nation is under attack, from within or without, liberals side with the enemy. This is their essence."  (copied from the peice in Reason, I wouldn't deign to actually buy the crapola that Coulter calls a book.)  The essense of a liberal is siding with the enemy?  That's funny, last time I checked, the essense of a liberal was supporting big government programs like Welfare, Social Security, and Medicare/medicaid.  i suppose that's siding with the enemy to a Right wing crazy-- a person to whom the only thing more scary than the poor is their OWN FUCKING SHADOW.  Is it Treasonous to say that the President's War on Terror is a dumb, vague, expensive, waste of time only in existence to scare people into voting for him?  Is it treasonous to say that-- while I support the oblideration of Sadam Hussein--- the only thing the Bush jr. Administration has managed to do is to shit all over a bunch of innocent civilians in Iraq, and managed to do that at the slight cost of billions of dollars and hundreds of US lives?

						   Dear Mr. Putin:      I understand the temptation to fuck over the rich, just to take their assests for you ailing economy, but  urlLink this  goes too far.  I think you have learned all the wrong lessons from us here Stateside.   First of all, haven't we shown you that building an economy on the smashing of a small and insignificant state that doesn't really do much to you really destroys the economy?  We've got Iraq, and you've got Chechnya.  let's both learn from our mistakes and do the right thing.  but second, You may have looked at Enron and worldcom and said to yourself, "if the US can do it, so can we." well, the difference is that-- and i don't know if Drel is guilty or not-- we'll give the executives a fair trial in a justice system that actually works, independently of politics.  Your country, meanwhile, is overrun by mafioso justice that involves little more than a nationalized version of a protection racket.    Most importantly, if you consistantly use these stupid political means of acquireing the assests of businessmen, you'll scare off the regualr -nonwhite-collar-crime-ridden- industrialists.    look, Drel may or may not be guilty, but having a trial that is politically motivated just means that in the end, it doesn't matter if he is or not.  There but for the grace. . . they'll say and move much needed foreign investment elsewhere.  Sir, i urge you to not go forward with this trial.  yours, JBS  p/s: party tonight.  my place.  there will be vodka for you, and whiskey for me.

						     The Burning Bush    I learned today from one of my particularly conspiracy theory-esque collegues that George H.W. Bush was the supervisor's supervisor to Lee H. Oswald.    my collegue was then arguing that GHWB  (doesn't that sound like some wierd chemical designer drug?) was, therefore, possibly involved in the Kennedy assassination.  of course, that's bunk.    however, it does raise a certain level of 'guilt by association,' for me.  for example, if you found out that one of your friends, although not directly involved in any terrorist activities, was hanging out with a bunch of Jihad'ers, that would definately raise some suspicions.  Ditto Iran-Contra.  the bush family is just sketchy.  .  .  and they have not one, but TWO presidents, and a governor to boot.   consider this post my "burning the effigy" of the bush family.

						     Liberate tuteme et Willy Wonka   (Save yourself from Willy Wonka)  I watched a childhood favorite today, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory, as a prelude on TNT for 24 hours of A Christmas Story.  Ted Turners really unimaginative programing choices notwithstanding, I realized just how evil Willy Wonka is.  There is an obvious joke here about some strange recluse who invites children to his place with candy, but Im not going there.  I think Willy Wonka is more subversive than that.  First consider the Oompa Loompas.  The weird little men that Wonka uses as his slave force.  He did rescue them from the vernicious kerns, but he now has them at his mercy.  I wonder what kind of remuneration they receive for their perpetual servitude.  Even if he treats them well, which remains to be seen, they do seem to be quite melancholy and somber.  Also, theyre working in hazardous environments, consider that in the span of a day four children almost die OSHA would be appalled.    next, consider his constant deception.  He tricks the children into thinking that they are actually working for Slugworth, who is, in fact, an employee of Wonka.  He manipulates five kids all day, and yet demands that they maintain total honesty with him.  Then, after promising a lifetime of chocolate, he takes it way, torturing Charlie.   Think about it, someone offers you a billion dollars, and shows it to you, cash, tax free, and then shuts the briefcase and walks away.  Isnt that torturous?  Finally, Wonka chooses Charlie to run his company, why a child? Because only a child would run it the way WONKA wanted it.  Only a child would keep to WONKAs ways.  Presumably this would also include the method of choosing a successor, creating an eternal empire of sweet chocolate tyranny.    So, whats my conclusion?  Wonka is a manipulative liar, with pedophile-esque tendencies.  Hes an evil genius, who attempts to control everything and everyone.  In the end this type of person strives for the only type of immortality he could achieve immortality of fame.  In this display of massive hubris Wonka shows his true form, Willy Wonka is, in fact, evil.

						   because they were such a hit; here's a short logic game:  so everyone knows the one with the two doors, one leading to eternal bliss the other leading to hell. in front of each one is a guard.   You walk up to the guards, and ask them how you can find out which door to go through.  one of the guards tells you, "One guard always lies, the other always tells the truth, and you can ask us a question to find out how to get to heaven." you know these rules are always true, i.e. the one who lies always lies and the one who tells the truth always tells the truth.  the answer, of course, is to ask one of the guards if the other guard would say that he (the one you're asking) guards the door to heaven; if he says yes, you go into the other one, if he says no, you go into that one.   but what if there's a second rule:  neither guard can give any information about what the other guard would say.   now how do you get to heaven?  anagram fun: William Safire= a wise film liar

						   Badass Democrats wanted:  In a really good  urlLink op/ed  today, Herbert says that the democrats are disorganized and afraid to take on the whitehouse and the biggest reason for Dean's unlikely success is that he constantly and vocally trounces Bush jr.    true dat.  What the democrats need to do is be more like Dean. . .not to say that they should, like dean, metamorph everytime someone ask's them about a particular policy, but rather to not be afraid to stand up to the whitehouse.   the core problem, i think, is that the Dems keep thinking that Bush's approval ratings are where they were a year ago-- around 90%, and not where they are now, a little under 50%.  Bush is eminently beatable, by any of the democrats, except maybe Al Sharpton-- he's a little too sketchy, and antisemetic, to win.  or perhaps Braun couldn't win (to my own chagrin, i don't think the US would vote in a woman, or a minority, certainly not a woman/minority.-- witness, for example, the failed VP attempt by Geraldine Ferraro. but i digress.)    The reason why Dean is awesome, and why i've changed from Clark for P to Clark for VP (under Dean) is because while the other democrats have failed to really attack the president (except at the debates), Dean is really starting to look like the man who will do just that.  what the party needs is a bad ass, and Dean is the only one stepping up to the plate.   However, the election is still a long way away, and even the primary is- in election terms- quite far down the road.  There's still time guys, i'd rather see the Yankees (a bunch of really strong candidates vie-ing for top billing) than the Red Sox (a mediocre team with one good pitcher).

						   All this controversy about Gay Marriage in Massachusetts has gotten me thinking about the gay community.    It seems to me that the gay political engines have put their emphasis into showing how homosexuality is a fact of nature, rather than a choice.  I can certainly see the merit in this view if homosexuality isnt a lifestyle choice, but a fact of genetics or biochemistry, or whatever, then it certainly seems unfair to treat gays as inferior much like being Black, or Asian, or any other minority, isnt a choice, but simply a fact of who that person is.  However, I think this view is terribly detrimental to homosexuals.  For a number of reasons.  First, it might lead to the belief that being gay is an infirmity or defect.  The movie But Im a Cheerleader had a humorous take on this parents thinking that they can teach, or medicate, or in some other way solve the problem of their children being gay.  Seems to me that its much better to put your efforts into saying that being gay is a decision, and its a perfectly fine decision to make.  Second, and this, I think, is a more philosophical problem I have with the biochemical vision of homosexuality. It seems dangerous to me to say that something is a biological fact of our behavior.  I really have a problem with most biological determinist views of human behavior.  The fact is that we dont have nearly enough knowledge of the intricacies of human behavior to make any type of intelligent ruling about what makes us act the way we are.   In an argument I had with a friend of mine who happens to be homosexual, he argued that saying homosexuality is a choice takes away from the belief that being gay is part of who you are.  Not at all.  I chose to be a liberal.  Its definitely part of who I am.  There are many facets of who we are that are choices.

						   Major Thanks to Nancy Hawa for this, except i hate the bush administration:   You are William Safire! You're ruthless and cunning, and a conservative demigod. You used to write speeches for Nixon. Now you write another column on the English language which has made you the world's most popular etymologist. You hate media deregulation, but love the Bush administration. If only you weren't such a brilliant writer.

						    urlLink Amy  talks about the recent case of african-americans bringing suit against particular companies who benefited from slavery.  By and large i agree with her, the idea of reparations is really legally very silly, and I think counterproductive to race relations in the United States.  most of what she writes is dead on, i'll not paraphrase here.  go read what she says.  however. she writes:   The plaintiffs claimed that they were entitled to financial compensation for the evils of slavery because their ancestors were slaves, and that the defendants should have to pay such compensation because they used slaves. However, they never proved that the slaves from whom they descended were the same slaves employed by the companies they sued.   this seems specious to me.  Its true that without that final link, there's no nexus between the harm and the harmed.  but, if we were to allow for reparations to be made in this form, it would seem absurd to require geneologies of this sort.  A similar argument was made in the case of jews and Swiss bankaccounts; the problem was that the Nazis destroyed much of the paper trail behind them, which made proving where YOUR money went very difficult.  similarly, it would seem a real injustice to fault descendants of slaves because the slave owners, fearing the reprocussions of the post-civil war republican party, destroyed their paperwork that showed them as slave owners, or that simply age would destroy such proof for them.    Again, I think reparations are a terrible idea. but if we're going to have them (hopefully not) they would have to stipulate that African Americans, as a whole, are the general inheritants of whatever reparations are allowed, and as such have standing to file suit, even if they're filing against someone who may or may not have been the direct "owner" of their ancestors.

						   interesting logic problem i read on Amherst's Planworld:  Newcomb's Problem (from today's phil 11 class):  A psych prof at your school has a reputation for being brilliant as well as possesed of an enormous fortune she has dedicated to her research. One day you get a request to report to her office at a certain hour. On a table there are two boxes. One of them, labeled A, is transparent; in it you can see an enormous pile of $100 bills. The other, labeled B, is opaque. She tells you that there is $10,000 in trasparent box A and that in box B there is either $1,000,000 or nothing. She tells you that she is going to give you a choice between:   (1) Taking just what is in box B. (2) Taking what is in both boxes.   Then she tells you that this is part of an experiment. During registration at the beginning of the quarter, you walked under a peculiar device that reminded you of the machines at airports that are used to prevent hijacking. You didn't think much about it at the time. But, she now informs you that this machine was something she designed and that it recorded an instant profile of your basic personality and character traits. On the basis of your profile, she made a prediction about the choice you would make, and she decided what to put Box B on the basis of this prediction:   (1) If she predicted you would take both, she put nothing in box B.   (2) If she predicted you would take only Box B, she put $1,000,000 in it.   At this point you ask her how accurate her predictions have been. She says that 1,000 students have been given the choice, and she has only been wrong once. In all the other cases, students who chose both boxes got only $10,000, whereas those who chose only box B got $1,000,000. Then she tells you to choose. What would you do?

						   There's a new blog war going on in my personal blogging circle-- with imput from a  urlLink Hippy ,  urlLink a post-thesis Patrick (mozel tov), and  urlLink Punky Sue Entin   Patrick talks about the externalities of foreign oil, and taxing those externalites.  He and I both seem to think that nuclear power is a sorely underinvested resource in the United States, largely because, at least I think, people don't really know enough about it, and consequently have some mistaken notions about its safety. . . I call this NIMBY-- or Not In My Back Yard; same principle goes for prisons, etc.    However, I started thinking about the Oil thing-- obviously its good that we start switching over from foreign, especially middleast, oil.  but I have several concerns.  1) Geopolitical: Oil is basically the cash crop of the mid-east, which is largely in a state of, at least, lesser wealth for its masses.  Oil profits essentially fall into the hands of the elites, aristocrats, nobility, politicians etc. in OPEC nations.  This has some obvious downsides-- the people end up in a state of near-surfdom, anti-US aristocrats fund terrorists, many other bad things.  But if those profits suddenly dropped, wouldn't the region massively destabilize?  Saudi Arabia isn't the cleanest ally, in fact I think they're quite bad, but they're better than the alternative, surely, and certainly better than an economic collapse in the region.  Think about if the area suddenly destabilizes, creating power vacuum.  who would come to power?  its possible that there would be a big move to overthrow the government into a more democratic form, but it seems more likely that it would end up more repressive, more anti-american, more fundamentalist.  2) Environmental: as we move away from foreign oil, and alternative power is not yet ready for widespread use, we'll inevitably begin to drill more domestically.  Patrick claims to hate ANWAR-- and I can't wait to hear his analysis, but I'm also going to pre-empt it.  Look, by most experts' claims, there's only maybe 10-12 years worth of oil hidden under the wildlife refuge--and I suspect its much less.  Does it really make all that much sense to trash one of the few completely pristine environments left on the planet for such a small profit of oil?    As we start to learn more about the environment, we really are learning how closely related all global ecosystems are.  The burning of the rain forests are causing GLOBAL effects. The arctic is a place where there are special spawning grounds, turtle nests, and tons of other really important places to migratory animals, and if anything happens, it could have drastic effects, going right up the food chain.     So these two concerns mean that we can't get away from foreign oil that quickly anyway.  So we have some time to work with.  I'd say that we should 1) largely deregulate utilities-- not California style, but deregulate nontheless. and 2) put R&D into Nuclear, Fast Breeder, Solar, Wind, geothermal, etc. . .   So as it turns out, most alternative power supplies (esp. wind and Solar) don't work well on wide scale use, which, because of America's utility model, prevents their widespread introduction.  However, its actually quite easy to use solar power to power, say, a single household.    which brings me to Nuclear.  I really think we should take a page from the East Asians, and start really using our nuclear power.  Nuclear waste now can be reprocessed, not infinitely, but into the DISTANT future, far enough that, my guess is, by the time our current stockpiles of spent fuel is used up we will have some entirely new way of powering things (cold fusion?  who knows. . .we're talking a few hundred years).  because these new ways of producing electricity are not yet ready for use, it will give the middle east some time to slowly adjust and develop a new market, not based on Oil as a primary cash crop, and save our environment from drilling.    what do you think, Bloggers?

						   For once Sep and I see eye to eye.   urlLink This Yalie  is a moron.  Look, I like religion.  I think that, by and large, it has been good for society, within limits.  But to claim that atheists (and i'm nodding at you, Eunich) are less likely to do moral things is stupid.  even worse is the claim that without a concept of God, you must be a moral relativist.    Look, i think the yalian was right in saying that relativism is stupid, but you can easily believe in Moral Objective Truths and not believe in God.    I believe in god, but let's be candid about what a concept of God actually proves.  more than that, i think this guy absorbs some of the premises that he's railing against.  he writes, "From a historical perspective, this kicks the very concept of "inalienable rights" into touch. Even Paton's "conception of common human decency" is based on an abstract and unprovable theory (as indeed is the American Constitution). As a direct result, the concept of "moral obligation" is subjective. Paton believes in "the right thing" but if I believe that the "right thing" involves curtailing her freedom of speech (for example), who is going to judge between us?"  Actually, the American Founders thought that their rules were objectively and SELF EVIDENTLY true-- meaning that you don't need any concept of god to prove them, they are a priori to human experiences, not to human religion; the Right of Man to be rule only by his own concent was based not based on divinity-- well, it was, but only metaphorically, harkening back to Aristotle's line "man is between Gods and Beasts."  The idea that man is not a perfect being does not require the existence of a perfect being.  point is that this guy seems to be saying that without some unexplainable, solely relavatory deity, there can be no objective morality.  Seems to me that we can create many different moral systems without God, systems which contain moral truths which exist cross-culturally.  You Go KANT, and even a nod to JSMill would be good here too.

						   just a brief word for now, when i get home i plan on a massive post that will cover a line-by-line of the State of the Union address (which, by the way, stank of lies so bad it should be called the State of the Onion--perhaps that smell was Bush's pants on fire?)  anyway, i have a question about  urlLink this  which was posted on Reason today. . . and I recall Patrick showing me a few weeks ago markets built on everything, from when/if there will be another terrorist attack, to if the Colts will win the Superbowl, stuff like that.  my question is how does this work?  i understand that, theoretically, you can make a market out of anything.  but what happens when the thing you're marketing on happens--- so if I bought 100 shares of Dean getting the nomination, at $.75/share, would I get $75 if he gets the nomination? if this doesn't work like that, it just seems like an odd way of buying and selling nothing at all.  If i do get the money, at the end, who pays it out?  Patrick, perhaps your assistance?  note #2) to Storey: Perhaps I am confusing, but i don't think i waiver politically, i consider myself an equal opportunity sasser. that is I take each issue on its own merits and level funny ad homenim attacks at the person/group who suggested it. . . . i've always hated buck-passing, Ann Coulter, Maureen Dowd, and I've always supported Great Society Programs.    That doesn't mean that i will support every great society-style social progressive program.  I can think that some cross the line where government intrusion is acceptable.  I can agree with FDR, without agreeing to Court Packing  and for the record.  I am not, nor have I ever been a Libertarian. and for the record: I may seem conservative to you, but then again, so would Karl Marx, you pinko Commie twinkletoed hippy bastard :)  at least we see eye-to-eye on the God question (re your "9 January 2004" posting)  speaking of sass, Storey, your father's website (i think you said it was your dad's) is  urlLink FUNNY BEYOND BELIEF   looks like hippyism might be genetic  p/s storey, get a damn comment engine.  note number 3: i found a nifty little script which tells me who is referring you here.  let's see where y'all came from.

						     The Blind Statue of Justice shouts "what the fuck?!" on these two news items today. . .    1)  urlLink Martha Stewart : aka OJ redux, without the slashing.  Seems to me that this case is more a trial of how people feel about Martha Stewart than about insider trading.  See, for example, the two paragraphs (roughly 1/5th of the article) devoted to how people feel about such a "polerizing figure."  what? are these people serious?  she's guilty, so she can do joy-joy things with her new prison grey home.    2) The  urlLink French  law banning the Bandana-- sorry Kate Myers, looks like you'll never be able to enroll in a paris public school. . . but what's really silly is the dude in this article who called the Muslim Veil a "militant sign."  funny that the country who is yelling at the U.S. for being racist in its war against terrorism would pass such a law. . . looks like the U.S. Doesn't have a monopoly on hypocracy.

						   got a new phone, the  urlLink T-Mobile Sidekick   its a sort of all in one device, combining the power of a pager, wireless internet browser, digital camera, palm pilot, and phone all in one.  I'm quite pleased with my purchase, it allows me to send/receive emails, instant messages, phonecalls, phone messages, voicemail and data transfers from anywhere where T moble has coverage.  admittedly Tmobile's coverage is its weak point. at least in america (as a european country, i'm told that it basically owns the coverage everywhere in europe, the way that sprint or verizon has in the united states.)  in a few years, Tmobile, which seems to be winning in the area of data and wireless internet phone use, will probably be just as covering in the states.    regardless, its a nice trade off, afterall, how often am I in the Pacific Northwest, or the midwest where voicestream is really weak.  They've got coverage in Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C., where its most likely i will end up in the next few years.  i've had the service for some time, and never really had a problem with coverage.  --except over the notch, where there's really no coverage at all, damn Holyoke range.  Another cool feature of the phone is the really big honkin' screen and keyboard, making it quite easy to type and see what you're typing.  As far as i can see the biggest problem with the thing is that its a little awkward at first to use as a phone.  you have to type in phone numbers, rather than having a traditional phone keypad.  but i can get used to that, especially in exchange for all the other awesome features it has

						    urlLink Lauren  posts a little bit on the topic of Pete Rose.  I'm a little less knowledgeable about the Statistic of Baseball than either Lauren or Sep, so if i make a mistake, please correct me.  However, I totally agree with the article Lauren Posts--- Rose deserves to be in the hall of fame.  I think the critical point is that all his gambling problems were made as a manager, not as a player.   As for the gambling, well Michael Jordan had a small gambling problem, which led to his first return to basketball (he was out of money).  true he wasn't gambling on games which he had a stake in the outcome, but the issue isn't that Rose lost games on purpose-- i don't think there's any evidence of that, or he'd be on the list of names like Joe Jackson and the Chicago Blacksox-- but that there was a risk he'd do that.  also the question of Rose being a 'shady' character.  the difference, of course, between Jordan and Rose is that Jordan is a more charismatic person, nicer to his peers, and can play the 'political' game more than Rose can.  Rose is a harsh person.  but that's not really enough to mean that Jordan should go to the Basketball Hall of Fame (located near Springfield MA, on rt 91, by the by) and Rose should stay out of cooperstown.  Darryl Strawberry had a coke habit and will probably make it in, Babe Ruth screwed 15 hookers a night, ate meat for breakfast lunch and dinner, and smoked 20 cubans a day.  Sports stars have always been rowdy, rulebreaking, and unsportsmanlike.  its part of the personality that drives one to become a great sports star--- there's a long tradition of primadonna-ism in pro-sports, and a part of that is "the rules don't apply to me."  Don't penalize Rose, baseball, you created him.

						   just to take a moment out of arguing about taxes, i thought i'd post an email i received this morning:       RESUME        George W. Bush        The White House, USA        EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:        LAW ENFORCEMENT:        I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the  influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been "lost" and is not available.        MILITARY:        I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take A drug test or answer any questions about my drug use.  By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat Duty in Vietnam.        COLLEGE:        I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.        PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:        I ran for U.S. Congress and lost.      I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975.  I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas.  The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock.  I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that Took land using taxpayer money.  With the help of my father and our right-wing friends in the oil   industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.        ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:        I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union.  During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden     city in America.  I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money.  I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American    history.  With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's  appointments to the Supreme Court, I became President after losing by   over 500,000 votes.        ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:                                --        I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record.  I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one     billion dollars per week.  I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury.  I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history.  I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any     12-month period.  I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.  I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the   U.S. stock market.  In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs And that trend continues every month.  I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any  administration in U.S. history. My "poorest millionaire," Condoleeza   Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.  I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S.   President.  I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most  corporate campaign donations.  My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best friends,     Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. History, Enron.  My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to     assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.  I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against   Investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent, investigating one of the biggest corporate rip-offs in history.  I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed.  I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.  I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded Government contracts.  I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any   President in U.S. history.  I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government.  I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.  I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations   remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.  I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.  I refused to allow inspectors access to U.S. "prisoners of war" detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.  I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election  inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).  I set the record for fewest number of press conferences of any President  since the advent of television.  I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period.  After taking off the entire month of August, I presided over the worst  security failure in U.S. history.  I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center  attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history. I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to   simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protest against any person in the history of mankind.  I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked,   pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so  against    the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community.  I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in   duty benefits for active duty troops and their families - in wartime.  In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking  Iraq, then blamed the lies on our British friends.  I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans   (71%)  view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.  I am supporting development of a nuclear "Tactical Bunker Buster," WMD.  I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden and     Saddam  Hussein to justice.        RECORDS AND REFERENCES:        All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's     library, sealed and unavailable for public view.  All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my   bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.  All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President,     attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.        PLEASE CONSIDER MY EXPERIENCE WHEN VOTING IN 2004.        PLEASE SEND THIS TO EVERY VOTER YOU KNOW.

						   i'm setting aside the "god" debate going on below in favor of the one on Patrick's blog re:  urlLink taxation .  I plan on doing this with a series of posts.  the first thing i want to post about the question of tax schema is whether people who are wealthy have an increased obligation to society.  Well, that assumes an obligation that an individual has to society.  Most libertarians would disagree with that statement off the bat, saying that a person's prime responsibility is to himself, all others by contract or agreement only (even if the contract is the 'social' contract).  To this i'd say that there does exist such an obligation.  even in the absence of a 'social contract.' even in the state of nature, you still have obligations to 'do no wrong.'  although there's no enforcement mechanism, no law to hold you back, that doesn't mean that you have the right to do anything-- as many modern political philosophers have contended.  The Right to Murder, for example, simply cannot exist, for any reason.  by its very definition, you cannot have a right to do a wrong-- by its very nature, a right is something that you can justfully do.  and you cannot rightfully take a life without justification (i.e. murder).   so even in the state of nature you must obey certain laws, to be a moral person.  I think that is the basis of society, that we band together because without a government and laws, there's no enforcement of those rights.  This, i think, is the flaw in the way most (read APDA) people use State of Nature/Social Contract arguments.  The Social contract doesn't create the rights of man, it creates a mechanism to protect those rights. Ditto Veil of Ignorance.  its not that you use the veil of ignorance to see what rights you have, you use the veil of ignorance to see what type of society you'd live in in order to maximize the rights you have protected, not the rights you have.   It is those natural rights which also create the obligation of people to society.  Because you have an obligation to not abridge the rights of others-- just as much as they have a moral obligation not to abridge your own rights, we become a connected society, not just a disparate group of people who happen to live in the same place.    Ok, that said, so we all have some kind of obligation to each other.  step 1 complete.  Step 2 is that the wealthy have an increased obligation, manifesting in an obligation to pay more in taxes.    the obvious argument here is about diminishing returns-- that wealthy people value money less because they have more of it-- or, more clearly, that $1 to a poor man means more than $1 to a rich man.  While this seems generally true to me, i don't think it can really be the basis of a moral schema.  it is, after all, a psychological judgment about how much people value their own possessions.  but more than that, I also generally think that we have an obligation to pay our taxes, regardless of how highly we value our money.  so it seems that our own personal psychological value we put on our own possessions doesn't really make a difference in the tax schema we set up.  Comming next: what is the reason that the wealthy ought to pay more?

						    urlLink The War of Ideas, revisited  and a Howard Dean sidenote  The united states has always been good at ideological fights.  The Revolution, the war against British economic tyranny, was won. The Civil war, the fight against slavery, was won. WWI, the fight against European Aristocracy and the old world Empires, was won.  WWII, the fight against Fascism, was won.  the Cold war, the fight agaist Soviet authoritarianism was won.  We won all these wars because, for a large part, we viewed it as an ideological battle, which created in Americans (and allies) the will to do what was necessary to win.  compare that to the wars we've lost.  Vietnam was viewed as an overextendature (is that a word?) of Imperial power between two competing super-empires.  Korea was viewed as a 'police action,' with little to no real necessary ideological value.  In the end both Vietnam and Korea were smaller battles of the Cold war, which we won, in large part due to our ideological strengths.  The war of 1812 was a totally unnecessary war fought between the elected officials of the US and the unelected officials of Britain over no real moral value. history says that we fought it to a stalemate, but consider it was the last time our soil was invaded by a foreign power.  and, of course, there were smaller "expansion" wars, the Spanish/American etc. but at the time we viewed the Manifest Destiny of America as an ideology that propelled us to win.  Point is the War on Terror seems to be losing its steam.  why?  because even though the actions of Terrorists are completely without merit, the "good-guys" don't seem to be much better.  THe US supported both Sadam and Osama in the 1980s and seems to be supporting the wrong regimes in Saudi Arabia and Kawait even now, at the expense of more moderate Turkey (which itself isn't that great)    I say we unleash the one bomb we have not used since WWII-- America's productive capability.  I shall call this "the Bread Bomb."  the United States has more productive capability than any other nation/state ever, in the History of the Planet Earth.  Think about that for a second.  EVER.    We send some aid to the third world muslim nations and terrorist farming grounds, true, but only a drop in the bucket.  We need to become truly a world bread superpower.  Instead of subsidizing farmers to not produce, send our overproduction to the third world (who couldn't afford to buy our bread anyway).  Send our out of work engineers to rebuild infrastructure.  Make the United States such a world leader in humanitarianism that: 1) terrorists don't want to bomb us because they know it will hurt their families if we withhold aid 2) Americans realize that America really is a "good guy" 3) Third world nations stop farming out Terrorist camps because they need the Aid from the United States. 4) the war on terror becomes a war we know how to fight and win.  If you look at the presidential hopefuls who is most likely to fight in this manner?  other than Dean, maybe Clark (we know so little about him anyway)  certainly not Liberman, certainly not Edwards. and Certainly NOT BUSH.

						   ok, so what have people been talking about? (see comments below my last post)  first of all, I think adam's response of "well i'm agnostic about the existence of chairs, so i too am agnostic about God." is just philosophical pud-pulling of the worst kind.   Look, obviously a chair exists, barring wierd matrix-like psuedocartesian skeptical-to-the-point-of-nihilistic critiques.  Sidestepping the issue of does the real world exist, i think we can safely talk about the existence of chairs.  God isn't the same at all.  If he exists at all, he doesn't exist in the same way that a char or a table does.   Its the difference between the proximate cause and the cause of causes.   Or to put it more in Schanzerian thought (you're welcome, Emmanuel) We exist within a system, God exists outside of it, there seems to be absolutely no way of discerning anything about it specifically because we cannot step outside of our particular reference frame to see.    Just to say that "there's no evidence that it exists" is not a disproof.  especially when you consider all the good scholarly work on why God might want to be completely "OTHER" from mankind.  (see Simone Weil and her article Putting the Torah before God." )  so here's a difference between santa and god, which makes it rational to say that Santa doesn't exist but God might.  Santa does things which are, within his own paradigm, impossible.  Santa isn't an omnipotent being, just a mystical one.  he's not something which lives beyond our frame of reference, he was once a man (Saint Nicholas or perhaps Chris Kringle, i don't know enough about Christian Parables.)  God is different.  God exists beyond and behind our universe.  This is to say that if omnipotence exists its all or nothing.  there can't be a partially omnipresent /omnipotent being the way that Santa portrays to be.  But also, recognize that the stories about Santa Claus can be traced down a specific line of a single religious sect-- and not a particularly old one at that-- whereas virtually every culture, every system in the history of the world has a God-figure.  at the very least the human mind seems to attach to the idea of God, as much as a monomyth or hero architype.    but then, adam gives us this gem: " Does their increased sophistication make them any more or less plausible? I personally find the hardline "there is a single deity and all so-called scientific evidence is a hoax from god to test our faith" viewpoint more internally consistent, at least, then philosophically complex notions of god which try to reconcile themselves with science."  what?    Adam could say the exact same thing to science is a test of faith view that he could say to me--- which is "prove it."  there's no more ultimate proff that Science is a  test of faith than there is for God's existence.    I don't understand why Adam has this wierd aversion to saying "Yes, there is Science, but before science there are also things which we can't understand, one of those might be an idea of ultimate perfection, some goal for all things to strive for."    by its very nature faith isn't the type of thing that can be rationally justified. but that doesn't mean the having faith is irrational.    Think of it this way.  I have a box, and i tell you "inside this box is either a dead fish or $50,000.  which is it?  it's 50-50 either way and you'll never know, for i have sealed the box in such a way that it can never be opened or its interior examined in any way."  is it really rational to say "i know that its the fish," or "I know that its the money."  but more importantly, is it rational to say "i can even find an answer."  I have stipulated that there is no possible way to answer the question.   God is something of the same sort of example.  we've stipulated that God is the type of thing that can't be proven or disproven.  It's not rational to say that he exists nor is it rational to say that he doesn't exist.  that doesn't mean that saying "I will never know for certain, but i will behave as God does, because i want to be the type of person who has faith."  is that really all that irrational?

						   Julian weighs in on the God question, which, if you're a regular listener here you'd know is a subject i've grown fond of posting about. . especially in response to Athiests who claim that believing in god is irrational.    I've said it before and i'll say it again, please stop trying to make intelligent arguments about the existence or nonexistence of god.  i don't know, you don't know.  we don't know together.  point is that on some level the only stance with regard to god that is rational really is the agnostic-- just to say "who knows if there's a god or not."  Julian almost sidesteps this with his clever  urlLink little rant about believing in Santa and believing in god.   And while i think Julian was giving more a personalized recollection and explaination of his current beliefs rather than a justification of those beliefs, it still seems that something must be said on this: because Santa doesn't exist, and Santa and God have some similar charactersistics. does that mean that God doesn't exist?   surely Julian can appreciate that the concept of God, or ultimate perfection/goodness/whathaveyou  is something that, in the end, is more complex than a simple afterlife judge/jury/executioner.  remember that the idea of judgement is a very particular view of what God is.  many religions have no mechanism for afterlife judgement.  Once again the point is not that there is a god, or there isn't a god. but its to say that, strictly speaking, its no more irrational to believe in god than not to.  both sides make assumptions that cannot possibly be verified by any living creature, certainly not by YOU,

						   I'm sure this isn't an original comparison-- meaning i'm sure that a hundred people have already done it.  But i've replaced all race-notations with homosexual-notation, just to see if the logic remains constant.  Door prize to anyone who can tell me what Supreme court case is being described:   In 1958, two residents of Virginia, X, a gay man, and Y, another man, were married in the District of Columbia. They returned to Virginia shortly thereafter. The couple was then charged with violating the state's anti-gay-marriage law. They were found guilty and sentenced to a year in jail (the trial judge agreed to suspend the sentence if they would leave Virginia and not return for 25 years).      Question Presented  Did Virginia's law violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?     Conclusion  Yes. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that distinctions drawn according to sexual orientation were generally "odious to a free people" and were subject to "the most rigid scrutiny" under the Equal Protection Clause. The Virginia law, the Court found, had no legitimate purpose "independent of invidious sexual orientation discrimination." The Court rejected the state's argument that the statute was legitimate because it applied equally to both Hetrosexuals and Homosexuals and found that such classifications were not subject to a "rational purpose" test under the Fourteenth Amendment.   well can you guess which case it is?  but more importantly, does the logic still hold water, as applied above?    I think it does.    part of the reasoning for equal rights-- for freeing the slaves back in the 1860s-- was Lincoln's line that there's no principle that applies to blacks that would not also apply to whites;  so if you were to say that its intelligence that makes white people rule, then you have to let the smartest man rule you.  If its color, then you have to let the lightest skinned man rule you, etc.     using this same method, is there any principle which would apply to homosexual marriages which wouldn't apply to regular man/woman marriages.  1)  Gay people can't have children . well, obviously there's a state interest in marriages fostering good families.  but that doesn't mean that we deny marriages to barren people.  also, i find this specious when the state also bars homosexuals from adopting. . . sort of a catch 22, if we allowed gays to have children they could then get married. but they can't get married because we don't let them have children.  this argument makes my head hurt.  2)  gay people tend to have bad families, be pedophiles, etc.   this statistically isn't true. but ignoring that, pedophilia is just as big a problem for heterosexuals, like when we hear about a 34 year old molesting a 12 year old girl, it still isn't ok.  As for being bad families, well, a couple of things.  first, i think most of the stigma surrounding a 2 dad family, or a 2 mom family, that a child will have to endure is the fact that it is so rare.  Just like single parent or racially intermarried families were once stigmatized and not anymore, eventually this stigma will disappear.  but more to the point, people who argue this would have to agree that the most depraved, negligent family is better than the best and most loving homosexual family.  I don't think this can be reasonably argued.  3)  homosexual sex is wrong , well i agree that arguments which say "its just two consenting adults" aren't enough. . . you might say that about anything: "officer, he wanted me to kill him. Its ok, we're two consenting adults." granted this is a bit of a contentious claim, but unless you're from the NYU debate team, something about that situation leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  However, it still doesn't seem that homosexual sex harms anyone else, and certainly the types of sex acts that homosexuals engage in aren't all that unthinkable for hetrosexuals. . . this is a hard claim to make, without resorting to 'because the bible said so.'-- and the bible also said that slavery's ok.  so yeah, no "no gay unions" amendment to the const.  i would imagine it's going to fail, anyway.  i would like to think that there's no supermajority of people who are bigoted bush disciples.

						   yet another in a long line of online personality quizzes (these are becoming a small obsession.)  this one from OKcupid, via Sep and Dolan.  Well-liked. Well-established. You are The Loverboy. Loverboys thrive in committed, steady relationships--as opposed to, say, Playboys, who want sex without too much attachment.       You've had many relationships and nearly all of them have been successful. You're a nice guy, you know the ropes, and even if you can be a little hasty with decisions, most girls think of you as a total catch. Your hastiness comes off as spontaneity most of the time anyhow, making you especially popular in your circle of friends, too.    Your exact opposite: The Billy Goat  Deliberate Brutal Sex Dreamer       You know not to make the typical Loverboy mistake of choosing someone who appreciates your good humor and popularity, but who offers nothing in return. You belong with someone outgoing, independent, and creative. Otherwise, you'll get bored. And then instead of surprising her with flowers or a practical joke, you'll surprise her by leaving.

						    "Every Time I think I'm Out, They Pull Me Back In"  -- Al Pachino, in The Godfather II  OR  "We should not need a permission slip from the World"  -- George W. Bush   So, it seems my planned break from blogging is not going to happen, as the " urlLink war of 1812 " between me and Phil demonstrates.    After reading the whole thing, i think the basic disagreement between us is that he thinks that international agreement, manifested in the U.N. is an appropriate and necessary reason for domestic legislation.  I, on the other hand, think that the international community could go fly a kite.  bear in mind, importantly, that this post is to say nothing of whether global governance, in principle, is a good or bad thing.  I am actually quite undecided on that issue.  But the current incarnation of a global state is woefully lacking-- to the point of uselessness.  the first reason i think that is because the international community bears no consent from its individual nations.  Unelected diplomats from UK, France, or even Barundi arguing about vague international precedents with unelected diplomats from the US hardly constitutes a representative or legislative body. The UN charter also recognizes the sovereign authority of each member nation, therefore precluding any legislative power of the UN as a whole.    This does not mean, however, that the UN cannot have some sort of vague symbolic power. . . that it can, as Phil states, demonstrate some sort of international voice, or opinion poll of what the world wants.  but what's the value of that?  the world consists in many nation each voting in different ways for different reasons.  Take the ICJ, for example.  some states may support it because they're a transitional state with lots of past war crimes.  Others may support an ICJ because they know that the ICJ will be comprised with a bunch of judges from their country.  simply being a signature on the ICJ charter doesn't create any sort of statement of WHY that particular nation supports it.    And statements and actions from the UN are very politically motivated.  France, for example, tries to be the voice of the third world and opposes the US on principle, it seems difficult to say that statements from the UN have any sort of moral motivation.  Other countries in the world have national interests at odds with American interests.  the American government's first responsibility is to its own citizens, just as other countries responsibilities are to thiers.  why do their interests take precedent over ours.  This isn't of course to say that we should ignore the UN-- and when our actions have material reprocussions from the rest of the world, we should certainly take that into account, but simply saying that "the UN doesn't like what we're doing" isn't an argument against a particular policy.   p/s Sepdawg, strict constructionism is my next post. and, related to that, LDC's defense of civil disobedience in San Fran (Storey, you may want to keep an eye out. . .I just know you're going to love it.)   urlLink a NEOCON pushing to the left?     urlLink      I'm Weekend Update Jimmy!   urlLink Take the Jimmy Fallon recurring SNL character quiz here.   created by  urlLink     urlLink stomps  .

						   1 exception to last post:  online personality quizzes:  YOU ARE RULE 11!  You were designed to make sure that attorneys in federal cases make reasonable inquiries into fact or law before submitting pleadings, motions, or other papers.  You were a real hardass in 1983, when you snuffed out all legal creativity from federal proceedings and embarassed well-meaning but overzealous attorneys.  You loosened up a bit in 1993, when you began allowing plaintiffs to make allegations in their complaints that are likely to have evidenciary support after discovery, and when you allowed a 21 day period for the erring attorney to withdraw the errant motion. Sure, you keep everything running on the up and up, but it's clear that things would be a lot more fun without you around.     urlLink Which Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

						   some more personal updates: 1) back from cornell, the tournament went really well i think, I got a chance to show off my tab-skills, by helping out.  it was sort of fun, as much as tab-instead-of-partying can be.  but more to the point, it was good to see the campus.  My original concern was that it seemed too far away, too isolated, to suit my new "cityboy"ishness.  but, as Ez-E (Emmanuel) Ice Cube(Schoonover), D.O.C. (Andrew Grossman), the Snoop DO-double G (Glunt) showed me the town of Ithica and the area around the college, I found it to be a really nice mix of city-town, of things to do and people to see, and of community and isolation.  A neat part of that mix is the idea of Ithica Dollars, which i may post on in the near future.  and the Gorge is really neat.  2) I'm starting 2 new classes in the near future.  1) a paralegal certifigate class at BU continuing education, which should be a breeze, considering i've been a paralegal for almost 3/4 of a year now.  and 2) a Bamboa class.. Bamboa is a type of Tibetian martial arts--- very closely aligned with tibetan buddhism.  Its sort of a common misconception that the Tibetian buddhists are pacificsts.  THIS particular Dalhi Lama is a pacificst but others have really known how to kick ass.  in fact, the Buddha, himself, was once known as Prince of the Nine Weapons.  He could unleash the enlightenment.  3) Mr. Clayton.  I shall forgive the lack of CQ2 because BQ1 is just awesome.        You're  A Prayer for Owen Meany !   by John Irving     Despite humble and perhaps literally small beginnings, you inspire faith in almost everyone you know. You are an agent of higher powers, and you manifest this fact in mysterious and loud ways. A sense of destiny pervades your every waking moment, and you prepare with great detail for destiny fulfilled. When you speak, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS!      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     on a side note, anyone who has Schoonover's email address, I'd like to send him an email.  that's about all for now.

						   on Amherst's planworld, (sort of like a blog), there's been a minor spat going on between myself and my old sophmore year roommate, Gavin.    Sparked by Justice Scalia's recent speach at amherst, Gav argues that Scalia's doctrine of strict contextualism is fatally flawed.   Personal assertions about all parties involved and personal politics aside, the idea of a strict constitution, rather than a flexible one, seems really persuasive to me.    Its no longer a democrat/republican or liberal/conservative issue.  there are people on both sides who would like to simply "interpret" new rights, rules, obligations and such into the constitution.  Im sure for everyone who would interpret "the right to Gay Marriage" into the constitution there's someone who would put in a prohibition against abortion, and vice versa.  then, what the constitution dictates becomes subject to the political whims of the supreme court, not the "societal evolution" that pro-flexible constitution'ers want.   My argument isn't that we need to keep the constitution static, but that we should abide by the process set up in the constitution to create those new rules.    if we leave the constitution open for any unelected, political appointee to just put new stuff in, why have a constitution at all?  ball's in your court, Gav.

						   just some personal updates for now:  1) I'm heading to Cornell this weekend, and it'll be nice to see one of the schools i applied to-- I've been to cornell before, but this time i really want to look at it as if i were thinking about going there (because I am)  Also, I look forward to having fun with Berzerkowitz, Glunt, Bonnifeld, and both Grossmans (Grossmen?)  2) Last week I had my Northwestern University School of Law interview.  It seems to be one of the few schools that does interviews.  I think it went really well, it turns out that 92% of students at NU law have spent at least one year out of college- and 60% have been out at least 2 years.  Seeing's how I almost ended up there two years ago, before my time out, I think I have a good shot this time around.   I really want to go to NU, perhaps even over NYU.  but I'll post on that later-- i've actually been planning a big post about the idea of the  Will to Power , and i think part of my reasons for wanting to go to NU tie into that quite nicely.     3) Work continues to be good.  tell the truth its been oustanding.   I really enjoy my job, the people are all great, and i'm finding it quite interesting.  On a side note, anyone who needs some advice about their defaulted FFELP, SLS, PLUS, or STAFFORD student loans, I'm the dude to ask.  If you'd asked me two years ago if i'd ever be the type to be able to do 9-5 in an office i'd clearly say no way.  4) Rereading Dune, by Frank Herbert, in preparation for a massive reading of the entire Dune Series, from Dune through the end of the Saga.  I'm really picking up on the Messianism of it-- "I am he who can be many places at once, I am the fulcrum of fate, I walk the Golden Path," and even "my name is a killing word." there are some really nice parallels one could make between Paul Muad'dib and Jesus, or any messiah, perhaps a post sometime about that?  I'll think about it.

						    urlLink Brooks  writes in an Op-Ed in the NYTimes (which, lately has been my standard source for blog posts)  about what Bush would really say about himself if he were as eloquent as the average, well-educated, upper-class man.    First of all, doesn't it fault the president for being less than well-expressed?  Don't we want our leaders to be able to express themselves clearly?  but that's not what i really want to talk about.  Speaking as the president might, Brooks writes:   I have staked the security of this nation on two propositions; this election will be about whether those propositions are true.  .  .   Fair enough, let's take each one by one.   The first is that the war on terror means we have to escalate our alert status. We cannot wait for our enemies to launch their attacks because we are a nation already at war. We cannot wait for countries like France, China and Russia to see things our way because we are a nation at war.   I think few people would doubt that we're at war with terror, at the very least, Mr. Bush, Kudos for coining that term.  But people have a problem with the WAY you're fighting that war.  Alone, at the cost of our credibility--- the very weapon that's most effective against terrorists.  You were right to say that we shouldn't need a permission slip to go to war.  You'd be right if we were fighting a defensive war.  But much as I, myself, don't like it, we live in a systm of international law, and that law demands some UN oversight when we go out 'aconquering.  the War in Iraq was a pre-emptive strike.   and, even if it was the right war, and we smashed the regime good, we're not standing by to pick up the pieces-- which is what's harming our credibility.  " The second proposition is that 9/11 was not a discrete crime. Something so horrible could not grow from a small cause. I concluded that this war is a global, ideological and moral war. Some liberals have trouble grasping evil, and always think that if we could take care of the handguns or the cruise missiles or the W.M.D., our problems would be ameliorated. But I know the problem lies in the souls of our enemies. "  actually, wasn't it YOU who said that we need to go after the WMDs?  I think that most of the party liberals (with the exception of the Dean Faction) did support the war in Iraq, on the basis of our quick, decisive action, and then handing over control to the UN peacekeepers for international oversight.  that's not what you've done.  You've got to stop absurd-tion-ing that if you're against the WAY you're fighting you're for the terrorists, 'cause, sorry sister, not the case.   yes, there are just evil people in the world, and there probably always will be.  but you can lessen the control those people have over the various populaces by not acting like the very monster they're portraying you to be.   Brooks concludes with:   But they should understand that no issue matters to me deeply unless it touches my faith in God. I did not campaign as a government-cutter, and I do not feel called upon to become one. I do feel called upon to use American power to help create a freer world.    Actually, Mr. President, you did.  But the problem isn't the lack of cuts, its the tremendous growth in spending that even the most pro-big government liberals are hesitant about.  With your tax cuts in place, that's making the government coffers a little empty.   I could lose this election.    Thank the lord for tender mercies.  (yeah, this one is a cheap shot)    I don't know whether the American people are with me or not.    checking your latest poll numbers, most are not (another cheap shot)   But I know our hair-trigger reputation has jolted dictators in Libya, North Korea and elsewhere.    this remains to be seen.  North Korea's still there, Libya is still there, both are still totalitarian dictatorships.  just because they're more hesitatant to be crazy, in response to YOUR craziness, doesn't make your craziness justified.  I agree we need to depose Il, but being an american version of Il doesn't help.   I know that if in 20 years Iraq is free and the Arab world is progressing toward normalcy, no one will doubt that I did the right thing.     that's terrible logic.  fifty years ago, there were Jim Crow laws, but now, since we're progressing towards racial equality, does that mean that Jim Crow was the right thing?  obviously not.  Your Nepotistic and opportunistic policies in Iraq have SET BACK the road to Iraqi freedom, and only by handing over an increasing amount of control to the UN to oversee the the transition have we had any progress at all.  Oh, and by the way, there's still US soldiers there, getting killed at an average rate of one per day.   once again, right war, wrong method of fighting.  all in all, Mr. Brooks, thanks for the critique of the president.  Although I don't think you wanted it to be as critical as it came out.

						   If  urlLink Thomas Freidman  is The Man,  urlLink William Safire  is a God.  Freidman is The Man:  " [the American Soldiers'] professionalism and their belief in this mission are still amazingly high. If you want the antidote to all the creeps in that Super Bowl show, spend a day at Centcom. I promise you, you will walk away with one overriding feeling: We do not deserve these people. They are so much better than the country and the administration they are fighting for. We owe them so much more respect, so much more sacrifice of our own and so much better leadership from a Bush team whose real sin is not hyping Saddam's threat, but sending Americans to remove him without a plan for the morning after.  All I have to do is see what happened to the Kurds the other day ? this proud mountain people who have built a nice little democracy and free market in northern Iraq, only to have it suicide-bombed by Islamists ? to be reminded that this is a just war. It is a war of the forces of tolerance, pluralism and decency against the forces of intolerance, bigotry and religious fascism. "  I really think that Freidman has the right stance on the War in Iraq.   Even if we were lied to by our president, the war, itself, was the right war, and probably an inevitable one after we failed to get Sadam out of power in Gulf War I.  Friedman and I still agree that the administration has been totally reckless in its war administration.   However i don't, as Friedman seems to, think this forgives the Administration for falsifying evidence, bringing power to bear over intelligence, and misleading the american populace over the reasons for the war.    I find it ironic that the people who 1) defended Nixon from "liberal attacks" after watergate and 2) tried to impeach Clinton for getting a hummer are now 3) defending the president's lies despite overwhelming evidence that there was no real threat in Iraq.      (actually, that's not ironic, its all related:  the principles they set out in 1) and 2) force them to either say that the president lied, and should be impeached or that he didn't lie at all.  That puts them in somewhat of an untennable position.  the problem is, of course, that 1) and 2) are both wrong--- Nixon should have been impeached for abusing presidential power, and Clinton should not have been; both lied, Nixon to cover a massive breach of public trust, and clinton to get a BJ that never once affected his ability to be president. . . just a side note)  But more to the point, Friedman is right on-- we need to start making this into an ideological war, rather than a war of power;  we need to get our allies back on board by saying "we're not just here to make Halliburton and Rathyeon rich, but to make life better for the Kurds in the north, and the Iraqi people in general."    That'll make it politically tenable to "unleash the bread bomb," which i've spoken of previously-- make the United States such a leader in humanitarianism that the terrorists actually fear to damage our interests because their families are dependant on US international aid.   ok, enough with that.  Why William Safire is a destiny.  Putin has become less than a sucessor to Yeltsin, and more of a sucessor to Gorbechev in his relentless pursuit of authoritarian power in Russia.    While our attention was elsewhere, Putin has put businessmen in jail for making too much money, reminiscent of Politboro style gestapo tactics of the 1960-70s.    And his agents, as Safire points out, are pulling in the unstable government in the Ukraine closer and closer under Sov-ahem- Russian control.  Moldavia is already run by KGB ex-aprachiks, and when Ivanov said, (quoted from Safire) "One of the major priorities of the Russian foreign policy is our relationship with our closest neighbors . . . relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States are in no way a hallmark of Russian-brand `neo-imperialism,' as some try to depict it, but an imperative for security. . . ." he sounds surprisingly like someone saying "we need breathing room."    All in all, the russian democracy seems to be based more on the smashing of chechnya than real democratic ideals.  That's why the expansion of Nato into eastern Europe is so crucial-- it keeps the Russian Bear afraid of the west, and give us leverage to curtail these sorts of anti-west/anti-democratic tactics.   And I thought the cold war had ended.

						    An idea through a Kevin Becon Game style of websurfing   So I found  urlLink here , through  urlLink E-Schteino ,  and ended up reading the page about how the medium that information is presented in affects the information that is presented.  Granted, that's true to an extent. If i were trying to give you the plot outline of  Oedipus Rex , via smoke signals, you'd probably not get it, unless you're a  urlLink caveman  .  But once communication is done in a reasonable medium, its rather odd to attack the medium rather than the information.   More specifically, it seems quite stupid to me that because a powerpoint was done poorly, NASA ENGINEERS missed the fact that a critical component might be faulty.  Perhaps i'm defending Powerpoint because its earning me a slew of cash in the next few weeks, or perhaps i'm arguing against Sep's wierd anti-spelling mistake/typo jihad, but maybe you should attack the information, rather than the mode of communication.   But moreover, the HBS prof writes:   my peeve with Powerpoint is that it forces explanations into linear form. As a result, system level explanations, especially those which include feedback loops and cycles, are lost.    this is actually untrue.  Well, it is true, if you only have the most basic of basic understandings of how powerpoint works.  but Feedback loops and systemic explainations can easily be demonstrated.  Powerpoint wins.  sidenote:  Julian Sanchez has apparently moved entirely out of personal blogging in favor of Reason, hit and run.  Unfortunate.  I enjoyed his antics of pop culture and small scale philosophics.

						    urlLink Lauren  posts about the idea of a juvenile death penalty.  I've been thinking about it for a while, and i don't really see a problem with it. . . before you get all angry, let me say that I can't see any argument for no juvenile death penalty that doesn't also apply to the death penalty in general.  first, its unfair, well, the death penalty tends to be unfair.  I am not against capital punishment in principle, but there definately needs to be a solid examination of its implementation--- i dont know the statistics off hand, but a disproportionate number of minorities get executed.  While that doesn't PROVE that its being unfairly implemented, its certainly an indication.  Better to be less sanguine about killing people.  But the reason why we have minors in the adult prison system is because we say that there is no magical awakeness that appears on your 18th birthday.  18 is an arbitrary age that we chose because it "seems about right."  and we examine the corner cases individually.  However, when a juvenile is put in the adult system, its because we've determined that he/she has an awareness of an adult, and so should receive adult punishments.    if that's so, if we're going to include the death penalty in our possible sentances for adults, why not include it for people who are, yes, technically minors, but we've decided are ok to be treated as adults.    again, i have strong reservations about capital punishment in general, but i see no need to distinguish between the two.    p/s its quite telling that the acronym for death penalty is D.P.

						    urlLink AMHERST, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT ON A YELLOW LIGHT!    In other news,  urlLink Amy  highlights FIRE, a website which seems to rate institutions in terms of their censorship.  My alma mater received a yellow light because of the following policy statements:   Faculty Handbook - Academic Regulations - A. Academic Regulations - 2. Statement on Freedom of Expression and Dissent - 3. Statement on Respect for Persons  Respect for the rights, dignity and integrity of others is essential for the well-being of a community. Actions by any person which do not reflect such respect for others are damaging to each member of the community and hence damaging to Amherst College. Each member of the community should be free from interference, intimidation or disparagement in the work place, the classroom and the social, recreational and residential environment.

Statement on Freedom of Expression and Dissent - 3. Statement on Respect for Persons  Each member of the community should be free from interference, intimidation or disparagement in the work place, the classroom and the social, recreational and residential environment.  View full policy (PDF, 28 KB). You must have Adobe Acrobat installed to view this document.    It kind of irked me that these two statements gave Amherst a yellow light.  first of all, these policies are clearly aimed at allowing the most speech-- preventing others from intimidating and stopping people from expressing their views.   That seems to be a fine goal to me.    Secondly, Amy argues that people have the right to make such disparaging remarks, and the right to be free from such statements being censored.  I take issue with that.  While its one thing to make a political statment of the sort that may implicate certain minorities/traditionally oppressed groups, its entirely different to simply disparage a group.  statements of the latter group really don't express a viewpoint other than "I hate X group." and don't really fall under the category of public speech that deserves to be free.    The Amherst Policy aims at separating simple hate speech from legitimate political expressions.    Look, I like free speech as much as the next guy, but the purpose of free speech isn't that everyone can say any crazy thing they like.  Its to allow all legitimate viewpoints-- viewpoints that it would be legitimate to choose for oneself.  Things like Sexually Harrassing statements, racially hateful statements and the like aren't really legitimate a choice.  We shouldn't be free to choose Nazism, and similarly we shouldn't be free to choose hate speech.  Amherst College shouldn't be faulted for preventing it, either.  also I now believe that  urlLink John Dolan  is funnier on his blog than he has ever been in real life.

						    urlLink Storey  responds to the reparations debate, with Natives deserve reparations.  I actually tend to agree with storey on this one.  The difference being that while African's institutional slavery ended with the civil war, the institutional disenfrancisement of Natives continues.    However, reparations aren't the answer here.  We should get rid of Plenary power over the reservations.  (and this was a debate case i ran many times, with a generally winning record. but i'll try not to fall back into the old case setup, and stick to generalities, oh and if anyone wants the case,  urlLink email  me-- feel free to run it, just don't run it in front of me.)     So the way that government works in the reservations is that the tribal governments can pass any law they want, using any system of government they want, (with some oversight) with the caviat that any law has to be  actively approved  by congress and the BNAA (native american affairs).  This is a sucky set up for several reasons. . . First of all, it means that the Tribal laws take years to be enacted.  because Natives who live on reservations don't actually count in federal legislative elections, (i.e. they don't have any direct representatives in congress) nobody really cares about their laws.  This is especially bad considering that all their money is being sucked off the reservations by Corporations who continuously shaft the natives because of the lack of oversight.    secondly, it sort of generally sucks that we sort-of give them autonomy.  I really dislike half-way messures.  Either we should decide that the reservations need to have soverignty, and give it to them, or we should decide that they don't and have the reservations fall under State control, but the Feds have no reason to be involved--- the Feds have been shitty to the Indians already, No?

						     Hard on Their Terrorists, Soft on Our Terrorists  :  Each and every day I read the NYtimes and I see more evidence that the Bush administration is evil.  I started with the assumption that the Bush type of radical, hardline, religious (yet somehow "compassionate") conservatives were just mistaken, at the worst, misguided ideologues.    I am  urlLink now  convinced that the Phrase "Evil be my Good" hangs somewhere in the whitehouse (i'm guessing Karl Rove's office).    In case you haven't read the Op-Ed contribution I linked, Bush is challenging the Alien Tort Claims Act, a law which has been in effect since 1789, and which has been upheld in many court cases-- I think the actual number is 25.    The ATCA allows noncitizens, most of whom are political refugees and asylumates living in the US to seek civil retribution from dictators and foreign nationals, in cases in which the defendants have committed crimes "against the Law of nations."  In addition to the cases cited in the NYtimes, it was also brought to bear on Swiss banks, forcing them to return, or at least compensate, Survivors and Children of Survivors of the Holocaust.    I am sickened that my country is now considering dropping one of its greatest laws.   While we are not able to act in every instance of atrocity worldwide, at least we can say that when we are able to act, we do.  This law says that whenever we are capable of punishing a violator of human rights, we will hold him/her accountable.    It is true that International law is vague and confused, at best.  But there are certain norms that the International Community recognizes.   Even non-signataries to the Geneva Conventions may be held accountable for systematic rape, torture and murder.  Even non-signataries to the NNPT are prevented from developing nuclear arms.  And the United States used to be the power behind the international community.  The cop on the block, as it were, to enforce these rulings.  Part of that was the ability of political refugees to seek redress here, when they couldn't there.    What reasons would make us want to drop this law-- or at the very least eviscerate it?  a line from  urlLink this  makes it clear.  Lately, the ATCA has been used to sue Transnational companies for their actions outside the US.  It is becoming a law which will contain companies' actions around the world.  however, the Bush Admin, which has done almost nothing to curtail the amazing degree of Enron-like corporate crime, would have none of that.    The Bush administration seeks to change that, only so that it can allow its political and economic allies to act irresponsibly and avoid accountability.  And they wonder why other people in the world are  doubting American leadership.

						   I can show off my history knowledge too.  showing off, is really what  urlLink this   Ny times op ed is.  What the guy does is make a slew of strange arguments from history that ultimately ammount to nothing more than an appeal to authority. . . well, Ben Franklin felt this way, so you should too.  The questions raised by Newdow (i'll leave the important, but not-press-covered question of standing to the side line for now) have less to do with actual separation of church and state than they do with a single man's crusaide. . . "i'll take this to the surpreme court if I have to." and he did.  but the phrase "under god," was added while we were fighting against the "godless" communists doesn't seem to me to be a violation of church and state. . . the stance of virtually every reasonable government man I have ever heard was that the phrase is a "pro forma" action, and that-- just as "In God We Trust," "So Help Me God" (which is an ad lib, not officially part of the real oath of office), or "year of our lord"-- we say over and over until there is no meaning left in it. These statements are not declarations of religious belief or dogma, nor do they create any entangling links between religion and government.    They are simply acknowledgements of the neoclassical ethos that pervades american political theory-- that there is something inherently special about a human being, something which, for lack of better terminology, we have called 'divine.'   I suppose my antipathy to Newdow is based on a distaste i have for people who think that anything they happen to disagree with has to have a constitutional remedy.  Newdow seems to think that if you change the words of the Pledge, you'll change the pledge.  that's just absurd.  The pledge only has meaning to people who understand it in the first place.  School children don't-- they say it because teacher says to, not because they are pledging to do anything they can comprehend.   It is a procedure that has lost its meaning; but we continue the ritual because tradition tells us to.  There is no harm in that.

						     Who's the Real Threat?    in his recent Op-Ed,  urlLink Friedman  warns that if Spain continues its appeasing approach, then more terrorists will attack on the eve of elections, attempting to destabilize countries by electing more radical regimes.  The exception that proves his rule is, of course, the United States.   Another terror attack will likely do the opposite for this nation-- it will increase  opposition  to the radical President, not support.  The dominant republican party, hanging on to their razor thin majority and until-recently-iron-tight-and-now-quite-tentative contol of the whitehouse, has staked its life on the ability of our. . . shall I say. . . average-joe president to fight a most unaverage, unprecedented, and confusing war.   As another NYtimes OP-Ed pointed out today, the entire administration is peopled with cold warriors, who were caught with their pants down during sept 11th.  They were able to grasp the concept of a hostile government in Afganistan harboring terrorists, but they have been completely unable to grasp the concept of an unaligned, hazy, and clandestine grouping of people who do not operate within any nation, hostile or not.    The Administration's response has been to personally attack any and all detractors.  To lambast any-- even those within its own ranks-- who dare say that they have not been up to the job, and that they have made mistakes.   In effect, they have replaced the old republican credo, "Are you better off today than 4 years ago?" with the new republican battlecry, "Do you think you are safer now than you were before (or just after) september 11th."  I say here, 'do you think,' because so much of what this administration has done to combat terrorism has been kept secret.  One must be reminded of Nixon's secret plan to win Vietnam.   But, if we agree with Friedman's logic-- and I would imagine most would-- it means that we are, in fact, safer today.  Safer, not as a result of any particular policy of the Bush administration, but because they are a form of appeasement.  The terrorists want more radicalizations, more leadership willing to 'go it alone,' more people who have Bush's 'strike first, ask later' attitude.  Because that type of reckless leadership is what causes more terrorism, more hatred, and more disgruntled youths in islamic countries turning to fundamentalism and terrorism.    That might make us slightly safer from a terrorist's suicide bombs, but it means that we have sacrificed legitimate leadership.  This is what the terrorists want from us.  Is it worth the sacrifice?  For the Spanish, being drawn into a war that they are, ultimately, not a part of is simply not worth the cost.  The war on terror has to be an ideological war-- not a military one as the Administration is fighting.  While it is true that all good and just governments seem to have, at least, some obligation to fight against terrorism, terrorists, and those that would destroy legitimate governments, the obligation isn't to send troops to a costly, poorly run, occupation of a country only nominally involved in the battle against actual terrorists.    But more costly than the human lives is the loss of freedom that has become synonymous with the war on terror.  Governments often, and legitimately, have to curtail freedoms during emergencies.  Such short term harms are both necessary and rightful-- Churchill suspended elections during WWII, Lincoln suspended the Writ of Habeus Corpus during the civil war.  But the Bush's administration's repeated and unapologetic incursions into private and civil rights have gone beyond any and all necessity.  The Patriot Act, with provisions right out of the Alien and Sedition acts, have made it possible for government to secretly and without any judicial oversight, to invade private homes with little or no cause.  The spanish saw this same corruption and perversion of a just cause when their previous government lied to them to tell them that the bombings were Bask seperatists.    If we want to do more than kill the current crop of terrorists-- whose ranks will simply be refilled by new militants-- we have to stop fighting this as a conventional war.  I've written on this in the past, but the war on terror isn't a war, a la vietnam, wwII etc.  rather its a political war, like the War on Drugs, or the War on Poverty.  Until we realize that, WE will keep appeasing the terrorists by curtailing our own rights, spreading instability throughout the middle east, and hating the good and decent islamic people.

						    urlLink Randomly Attacking Your Former Aide is the First Sign of Insanity   I really think the Bush administration has blown its top with this one.  First of all, Clarke's attacks that the administration wanted to go after Iraq before Al Queda post-sept. 11th are quite potentially damming given Bush's emphasis on his ability to fight the war on terror.  But, Clarke's recounting of the story that bush had asked him to look into whether Iraq and Saddam had anything to do with Sept. 11th seems like it could have been spun much differently by the administration.  They could have said, "well, we wanted to examine every possible situation, Iraq has been our enemy for a long time, and we knew that there are strong cultural ties, and Pan-arabism in the region that might have contributed to it.  We were just looking at every possiblity."  that would make the administration seem like its doing a better job in the war on terror, and it would fight claims that Bush is a "attack first, questions later" leader.   Instead, it seems like the President is just going after Clarke's personal record, and it puts the President on the defensive.   Now I'm the first one to critize the president's handling of the war in Iraq-- six months ago I was a hawk, and I still think we were justified in going into iraq, but not on the grounds the president laid out.  But wouldn't it seem like a better tact in this to say, "yeah, we asked him to look at all options, what's wrong with that?"  now Clarke's on the defensive.  Secondly, the administration's response that the President wasn't in the Situation room during the time Clarke is talking about it absolutely stupid.  WHY WASN'T HE?  WE WERE JUST ATTACKED.  SHOULDN'T THE PRESIDENT BE AT LEAST IN THE BRIEFING ROOM FINDING OUT WHAT HAPPENED?    Finally, the Bush's response that if Clarke knew that Al Queda was such a threat why didn't the Clinton Administration do anything about it is also quite absurd.  Clearly the Clinton admin DID do counter-terrorism, especially against Iraq and Al Queda, remember the bombings in Sudan?  those were training camps.  Oh and while we're on the subject, Clinton's military R&D programs are what allowed us to use those crazy smartbombs in Iraq.  but more importantly, why does the fact that a former president, who wasn't fighting a self-proclaimed war on terrorism, didn't emphasize something that NOBODY THOUGHT WAS A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES mean that the current president's shortcommings are OK.    Maybe Karl Rove has finally flipped?   actually, after thinking this over for a bit, i've noticed that its part of a larger trend within this administration.  This has been one of the most radically secret goverments ever.  Think about it, The Energy Task force members/meeting are secret, the Halliburton no-bid-contract meetings have been made secret, the Plume affair papers have been made secret.  There is a ton that the adminstration simply won't tell anyone.  and whenever anyone bothers to question why, they're hit with a massive attack from the administration.    Its finally gotten to the point where the fact that they're attacking is worse than the lies they're telling.    Remember Paul O'Neil? the former Secretary of the Tresurer?  I'm currently reading "the Price of Loyalty,"  and while Ron Suskund is, clearly, a Democratic-leaning writer, its quite clear that O'Neil and Alan Greenspan advised the president that the rapid runaway spending was dangerous especially given the tax cuts, but they were just ignored.  It would make more sense for the government to say, "well, other economists disagree. here is their names. we decided to go with what they said."  then it becomes an issue of economic theory, something that even educated voters have very little stomache for.  Instead the random attacks at O'Neil, personally and professionally create a very strange situation, revolving around 2 questions:  1) why would a former close aide to the president lie, only to be fired (or asked to resign/resigned under pressure) 2) if he was so incompentant/terrible, why did you make him a Cabinet level official in the first place  All this from someone who claimed to be "uniter, not a divider."  seems to me that Bush could side-step all of this, but instead decides to engage in these wierd attack battles.  I also find it wierd that both Paul O'Neil and Richard Clarke are not-democrats.  O'Neil is a party republican and Clarke is a non-partisan, serving as counter-terrorism Czar under Reagan, Bush Sr, and Clinton.

						   I should hear from law schools sometime within the next two weeks.    Specifically waiting on my top 2 choices: Northwestern and NYU, although Georgetown and UVA are high in the running as well.  Cornell needs to get off its butt and send out an acceptance too.    I'm excited about the law school thing, well, a little scared, but mostly excited.  My apps probably went out a little later than they should have, if i end up taking another year, i'll have to get my stuff together to apply sooner.  But, I'm still young, i've got a good set up here in boston, so I'm not worried.   And, I still haven't decided if I want to defer for another year if/when I'm accepted.  I really enjoy living in boston, especially if John and Helen move back here next year (which is a real possibility).  I guess I'll wait and see where I get accepted  Also, this weekend I participated in my first, ever, Surprise party-- for Kait's birthday.  Her reaction was classic: we all yelled "surprise" and she just stood there, blinked twice, and then walked back outside.  She needed a moment.    the Party was awesome, met some of Kait and Jerry's cool friends from BU and such.  Shaddock came around, he's a fun guy too.  Work has been really busy, we're filing new cases now, so most of my day is filled up with preparing the filing applications.  Picked up two new clients for my random side business.    Speaking of which, I'm thinking about dropping that.  Its fun, and the money is good, but it really is time consuming.  I think I really just did it to see if I can, and, apparently I can-- the company is doing well.  So, mission accomplished, I'm starting to lose interest.  Se la vie.  I'll pick up a new project soon-- maybe i'll finish carving the chess set-- I still only have 8 pieces: 6 pawns, a rook and a bishop.  Also, I've started writing again-- yes, its that cheezy fantacrap, based on a mix of styles from R.A. Salvatore, Tolkein, and Robert Jordan.  In the end all of these are just for "me," I'll probably end up never using the chess set to play a game of chess, and I'll probably never finish nor publish the fantacrap.    I figure time spent on one of these hobbies is better than time spent boobing out, watching crappy afternoon TV.   I find these random side projects and hobbies keep me interested in life.  I highly recommend that people pick up these random interests.  all in all, life is good.   Finally, I thought a few meta-blog comments are in order.  I'm thinking that i want to move this from a "thinking" blog to a more "what-i'm-up-to" style of blog-- although it'll probably end up more of a mix of both.  So I'll still engage in the blog-wars with Sep, Storey, Lauren, Emmanuel and Patrick, Bring It ON!

						    This Post is for you, Mom   As this year's opportunites for Law School dwindle, I'm forced to think about what I'm going to do next year if I'm not accepted anywhere I want to go.  Here's what I've come up with so far:  1) Learn 10 different kinds of Martial Arts. Wonder the country, a disillusioned hobo, much like Qui-Jin Kaine, solving crimes wherever I go.  2) become a Buddhist Monk  3) eschew the world of men for a higher calling, perhaps joining a rock band.  4) when I reapply next year, DO NOT APPLY TO SCHOOLS THAT I KNOW I DON'T WANT TO GO TO! Its just not worth it.  5) hire a band of Mercs to aid me in a coup of a small third world country, and then declare myself God-Emperor (I'm looking at you,  Djbouti ! You're going DOWN!)  6) while we're on the God-Emperor kick, I was thinking of starting my own L. Ron Hubbard meets David Koresh style cult, complete with mass weddings, directed by me.  YOu know me, I'm your god!  7) 2 words: Ditch Digger

						   1) welcome to blogging,  urlLink Jake  2) six-eight weeks begins this week.  updates as they come in-- fingers crossed  Finished reading what seems to be my father's blockbuster work, "Paul the Convert,"  about, you guessed it, St. Paul. Undoubtably some of it was over my head, but it focuses on re-interpreting the Pauline writings in light of Paul's own conversion experiences: his visons, his mission, etc.   Apparently how to view Paul within the theological community is a source of some disagreement.  Anyway, for an extended discussion on Paul, pick up the book (also, help me pay for law school)  but I do want to talk a little bit about one part in particular that I found really interesting:  the difference between Pauline and Jewish visions of the role of law.  Clearly, a political philosophy buff, its not surprising that i latched onto this section.  So the idea is that the Jews saw the Law-- the Torah-- as being an extention of God's goodness, so you follow the law because the law is attached to God.  Paul said the primary action is faith-- not that the law is unimportant or that you ought to break the law, but that there a distinction between faith and law.  For the jews, there was no such distinction.  In effect, there would have been no difference between the law-abidingness of the jews and the christians; at the time christianity was a sept/heresy of judiasm (Sorry dad, i know there's subtle difference between sept and heresy-- but its unimportant for this particular discussion).      However, there is a subtle and amazingly important shift in the metaphysic involved, and its a shift between what would now be a natural law vision of the Law and a positivist vision of the Law.  while first century jews saw the law as a outcome of God rather than humanity's inherent dignity/moral obligations, the structure is the same: that the Law is important because of a special relationship it has to a higher ethos: be it divine or human.    Pauline views of the law also resemble more positivist attitudes.  While a postitivist can make claims about the rightness/wrongness of the law, ultimately they view the law as 'the commands of a soverign.'  similarly, Paul would say you obey the law, because its a good thing to do, but faith is seperate, and primary, to that.  I have a whole lot to say on the natural law/positivist distinction, but for now I found it interesting to see an iteration of that debate going as far back as the first century.

						   A few personal comments and then on to my own review of "Passion"  1) Say it ain't so, Sep:  I have enjoyed reading your blog, and arguing with you.  While you are "phasing" out your blog, I hope it doesn't disappear entirely.  2) Easy go, Easy come: I find Larson's blog with a really interesting post about evolution as a social instrument-- to take the place of religion.  Perhaps I'll post a response here.  3) new links at bottom, Lauren and Steve.    Ok, that done, Mel Gibson's new vision of the last days of Christ.  I think enough has been said about the anti-semitism of this film.  Patrick doesn't see it, I think antisemitism is the movie's stated purpose.  However, I think I can critique the movie's take on the NT without resorting to "you're a racist" (although it clearly is.)    Actually, i retract that.  One quick comment about all the controversy of the movie.  well, maybe two.  First, I object to people coming away from the movie saying "wow, so THAT's what happened." It isn't.  its one particular view about what various (not even all new testament) sources say what happened.  I doubt highly that its an impartial view.  Remember that 1) the early christians were very much trying to distinguish themselves from the hebraic patriarchy, and 2) the Medieval scholars (from whom we get many of the ideas about "Jesus SUFFERED, rather than DIED, for our sins.") were writing in an atmosphere where jews were being blamed for many of the travesties of medieval life (e.g. the plague.) and 2). I really hate that people are taking their children to see this movie, saying that its "righteous violence," and therefore ok.  the same people are freaking out about Janet Jackson's boob.  I see something really backwards about that.  This is not a movie for children-- I typically enjoy violent, action movies, and i'm by no means a squeemish guy, but there were scenes in Passion that made ME want to vomit.    That said, I think there's a much bigger problem with the movie.  As a student of philosophy-- enlightenment mostly-- and as a jew, I've always found the story of Christ to be appealing.  There is something very ingrained (at least socially, but i would suspect its a deeper, jungian communal ideal) idea about the noble sacrifice.  That's why martyrdom is so powerful, even in this day and age.  For you debaters, think about how often you've used the "but you'll turn {insert unappealing/dangerous person here} into a Martyr" argument.    More than that, Christ was supposed to be this Iconic paradigm, and the bible is his story of awakening to divinity.  The power of the christ-figure is exactly that moment where "the sleeper awakens," to borrow a term from a different mesianic figure.      But Mel Gibson's movie squeezes out all of this feeling.  Instead of the Glory of Christ's ressurection (which appears as an afterthought in the last 5 seconds of the film) we are supposed to feel only a wierd mix of disgust, pity, and maybe a little bit of morbid fascination.  The idea that, as a martyr Jesus died for our sins isn't about the "died" part, its about the "for our sins" part.  That's what seperated him from the rest, from two thieves who were being cruicified nearby, for example.  that he wasn't just suffering for himself, as we would, but for the redemption of humanity.  With that in mind, the movie takes exactly the wrong stance on how to portray the death of christ.  But that's just my opinion.

						   Today, while waiting for 5pm on friday to roll around (which I still am); I noted this  urlLink article  on Rands (one of my daily reads which i haven't gotten around to putting a link for at the bottom) about blogging and spelling and grammer and such.  Once again I feel I should defend my loose style, with its gramatical and spelling mistakes.  First of all, i enjoy blogging, and I enjoy it because i can do it casually.  I don't have to worry about editing, the way that i have to edit a brief before i send it in, or a coverage request before i talk to an attorney, or a motion before the judge approves it.    Blogging is what it is-- a side note.

						    urlLink This   Ny Times OP-ED contribution suggests that John Kerry should form a Shadow Cabinet.    I found this a really interesting idea and a wonderful thought experiement.  So a shadow cabinet, used largely in parliamentary systems, is where the opposition creates a false government-- one which would, austensibly, be the one that HE-- in this case Kerry-- would set up.    I'll not lay out the articles arguments for a shadow cabinet, I'm just going to speculate on who would make good ministers/secretaries on it.  Surgeon General:  Howard Dean.  clearly a political appointment, but much as been written about Dean's leftist/green faction among democrats, and the worries that Dean's antiwar statement might scare off some moderates.  However, putting him in postition where his real authority lies-- as a doctor-- makes sense.  His strongest policy point has always been health care, a place that is quite questionable for GWB.  more to come   urlLink also: my new favorite website.  HILARIOUS

						    urlLink This  sounds like a few debaters I know.  In other news, Old debater Emily Garin-Clayton posted an ad for a PIRG job on the  urlLink APDA forum .  This reminded me of my own experience with MassPIRG, and later with NoPIRG (the anti-PIRG org. that developed on MHC campus).  Needless to say I was less than enthused with my PIRG experiences, and I'd like to take a moment to write about why I dislike the PIRGs.  Of course, I only have experience with the Mass, CT, and Vermont branches, so Emily, if you happen upon this, I cannot speak to CalPIRG at all.  I know the PIRGs tend to be very different, from state to state.  First of all, the Public Interest Research Group, is neither Public Interest, nor a Research Group.  it is a lobbying organization and as such has a very particular political agenda-- which, strangely enough-- seems to be exactly identical to the Green Party's political platform.    Secondly, the groups infrastructure, while all genuinely nice people-- well, mostly genuinely nice-- have absolutly no concept of political, economic or business manegment.  It was sort of like working for the Reich for Governor campaign-- which i've posted about before, its a bunch of undergrads running around like chickens with their heads cut off.   What they actually do is try to educate people while asking for donations, going door-to-door asking for money in exchange for a promise to try and lobby a particular law or group. (By the way, we were specifically told to ignore all "no soliciting" and all "no tresspassing" signs, i wonder at the legality of that.)   I'm all for grassroots campaigning, but the way this organization does it, the "rap" the campaigners tend to give is incredibly simplistic;  pollution of any kind=bad in all ways.  Most of the time they simply use misleading statistics and suspect studies to come up with "credible" or "reliable" evidence bulleted onto prefab'ed info sheets designed specifically to shade the evidence their way.    I think these causes are served much more credibly if they acknowledge some disadvantages of their proposals.  For example, I worked on a campaign to raise restrictions on the emitance of polutants on SUVs.  The fact sheets we were given, which i later found out to be a ball of lies, also ignored the fact that SUVs seem to be one of the few areas American auto manufacturers really kick the crap out of foreign imports.  Putting new restrictions on SUVs, and not their imports certainly has an effect on that, and lobbying people in places like along the Houstatonic, where GM and automotive component factories are such a huge employer, without laying out all the facts, just seems disengenuous to me.   Again, what I object to is the simplicity with which these subjects are treated.  MassPIRG was targeting an area with a policy that could potentially put people out of work in the area, without explaining all the consequences of that policy.  This is especially bad, considering that oft times the people who supported the group most were the people who couldn't afford to support the group.  I would find that the people living in amazing houses with five cars in the driveway, would rarely give the time of day (except for Great Barrington-- a place for New York liberal socialites to have their ski homes. . .) whereas the four families living in section 8 housing would be much more likely to skip dinner that night in order to pay for a year's membership. Added to this was the emphasis the group puts on Upselling:  trying to get people to give more money each year.  Given that its a group who gets its power through membership lists, and not monetary strength, it seems like this is a sketchy goal.  Remember that the PIRGs get lobbying power by saying to a legislator "look at our membership lists, these are the myriad of people who support us."  Why then, would more than a token show of support be important, a dollar or two, Especially when the vast majority of the donations were corporate or foundational, not from the public at large.  In the end of the day, I really don't know if I agreed with all the policies they lobbied for.  Perhaps that's something that put me off MassPIRG.  But MassPIRG also markets itself as a "nonpartisan" and "unbiased" public interest group when its anything but.

						   with that Interlude (see post re: the Passion of Christ below) done, back to Sepdawg.  First of all Sep, i must commend you: you bring the sass.  but don't try to bullshit a bullshiter; i'll sass you right back.  In the end, an angry tone, ad hominem attacks and references to many different types of philosophies (used to make yourself sound more intelligent) aren't really analysis.  But because they can be fun, I shall use them too. Furthermore, although it is true that you're probably more intelligent than the "lefties at Amherst," but then again, so are most shale bricks-- that's not an accomplishment, its a requisite for rationality.    First of all, Sep, you claim that I didn't address your "flexible constitution" argument.  interesting, i quote myself:   1) constitutional flexibility:   this argument states that societies change, and the law ought to change with it.   I find this argument suspect for a couple of reasons. First of all, I don't see how judges are arbiters of societal values. They are individuals, with individual viewpoints, just as likely to be "old and outdated" as "fresh and new." better that new constitutional rules have a mandate.   but more importantly, there are certain values which don't change, or ought not to change. No matter how much society as a whole changes, Freedom of Speech will always be a necessary part of a just regime. Ditto the right to not be enslaved, ditto the right to vote. Sometimes we need a constitution to restrain an angry society from abusing or attacking a certain ethnic group, oh say arabs.    Sounds like an argument against a flexible constitution.  2 actually.  What I said was that the constitution ought to be a static thing, that it enshrines rules that are true no matter what type of society you have, no matter how it evolves, no matter what social values happen to arise.  if that's the case, constitutional flexibility isn't such a good thing, no matter what your methodology of interpretation is.    Look, sep, my critique wasn't that Scalia's ahistorical texualism gives you flexibility, but that ANY METHOD OF INTERPRETATION THAT GIVES FLEXIBILITY IS BAD because a flexible constitution isn't a good thing, counter to popular belief.   You asked me to return to your original post.  What you said was that Scalia's textualism is based on a faulty notion of intention; that the framers didn't have a single, clear "intention" that can be discerned (in the way that when you said "watch TV," I couldn't say if you intended on watching a particular program, or Dom Deluise, or a blank tv screen etc.)   This seems dumb to me for a couple of reasons.  first of all, the Framers wrote extensively about what their vision for the constitution was.  We have their primary sources about what they thought, its not just a single comment "watch TV" situation. its as if you wrote "Watch TV*", and in the margin wrote a schedule of what, exactly, you wanted to watch and why.    But let's say you don't like using Framers' papers other than the constitution.  Its much easier to discern the intent of a statement of Moral value than it is one of personal, amoral, taste.  If i were to say "i like trees,"  you'd be right in asking what my intent was.  But if i were to say, "abridging the free exercise of religion is wrong for government to do," my intent becomes much more clear.  But also, because moral principles are accessible to all rational beings, you can also reconstruct my argument, starting from first principles, and leading, inexorably, to the necessity of government to be based on the consent of the governed, and to the individual freedom of rational creatures to believe in a divinity of their own.   and by the way, congratulations, sir, you can  use wierd corner cases to deflect attention from the actual argument. All methods of constitutional interpretation have wierd corner cases that seem difficult.  merely pointing out that a particular case results in a counterintuitive outcome isn't a real critique of anything, except maybe that your own intelligence quotient being above that of a flea.  your actual argument comes later, when you say:    "The framers and amenders could have intended both narrow and broad rules by the text they wrote, and that text does not itself tell us what to do in the event that these rules are later judged to be inconsistent. In order to determine the breadth/generality of the rules they intended, we need to look at their meta-intentions. When drafting Article X or Amendment Y, did they mean to solve particular problems to address the exigencies of the day, or did they mean to promulgate broad principles. Obviously, this is a case-by-case inquiry, but I think their general meta-intentions were of the second variety. In order to stay consistent with the framers'/amenders' intent regarding broader rules, we must sometimes act in tension with their intent regarding particulars. Our doing so leads Jordan to believe that we're less than faithful to the constitution. On the contrary, I think it means we're staying loyal to the constitution."   This isn't an argument for a flexible constitution; you're not saying that we need to allow judges to interpret new rules that aren't there.  what you're saying is that sometimes its hard to determine what IS there.  I disagree with that (see above) but I don't think that's really the main source of disagreement between us.    but then you say, "I can argue within any legitimate framework of interpretation that the constitution ought to be flexible in a very meaningful sense."  Ok, what that says is that regardless of a stance on framers' intent, or Scalian textualism, you can state that it is objectively good to have a flexible constitution.  good for you, let's hear it.  you haven't done that yet.   Look, a flexible constitution is appealing because it means that we can sometimes let in rules and laws which were never intended to be allowed.  Sometimes these rules are good, sometimes these rule are bad.   But we have an amendment process to ensure that the constitution CAN evolve with society, the Framers weren't Gods, and they probably made some mistakes-- I would say Slavery was the biggest-- and we can argue about the goodness of the constitution as it appeared in 1783. Not every bad law has a constitutional remedy.  To then allow judges to interpret into the constitution any crazy thing that they might want is simply to violate the Rule of Law, and create a legislator that has constitutional authority but no mandate from the people.

						   A Famous scholar's take on the Passion:  "Have you actually seen MG's film?  I went last night and found it far worse than I expected. BRUTAL! I was prepared to believe Medved and Siegel (the Jewish movie reviewers who said that there was nothing actually anti-semitic in the film).  Ok, he is an artist and this is a free country.   No problem.  But on the anti-semitism issue they are very wrong.  Evidently they are thinking, if it doesn't round Jews up for the camps, it's not anti-semitic.   The film is the most explicitly anti-semitic rendering of hte story that I have ever seen.  If you make the JEws as a group responsible for the crucifixion (Mt. 27:25) or say they're in league with Satan (John 89:44) that crosses the line from anti-Judaism to anti-semitism.  I've always been of the opinion that John 8:44 is actually anti-semitic because it depicts Jews as supernaturally in league with Satan. MG's Passion is a two hour meditation on that thought.  The Jews are shown consistently as demonic and under the control of Satan in a completely unredeemable way.  Even little Jewish boys turn into devils to torture Judas.  There is scarcely a likeable figure in the film who is Jewish, unless he is also Christian.  And how does he justify making Mr and Mrs. Pilate into a couple caught by circumstances beyond their control while going way beyond the NT in villifying the Jews?  In actual fact, Pilate was removed of his command by the Romans for being too cruel.  Think of that! Okay, I don't want to interfere with the Catholic piety which is often overtly being depicted in the film.  There is a late medieval tradition tradition ofthe sacred heart and the piety and a long-tradition of the sanctity of the suffering of the saints  which is quite sincerely believed and sonsoling to Catholics and it involves blood and suffering and being redeemed from sin by the suffering of Jesus and the giref of Mary.  So I don't want to impugn that piety.  There are some real chances for Christian religious piety, especially of the lenten sort in the way the Stations of the Cross are depicted, etc..  So why didn't he claim he was being true to his understanding of the Christian tradition--easy enough for him to have done?  The one thing it is not is a depiction of the NT.  There is absolutely no care taken about historical questions.  All four gospels are mixed with later piety about saints (Vernoica's veil) and the constant attention to Jesus' blood, etc.  The water and blood of the lance wound is like a waterfall.  But a great deal is left out.  He has the freedom to subtract as well as add.  Why then does he constantly amplify the anti-Jewish parts of the Gospels?    We know his use of Aramaic, and church Latin rather than Greek is unhistorical.  THe legionnaires speak Aramaic (possible I guess) but so does Pilate (pretty improbable) and Jesus speaks perfect church Latin (that's a miracle, actually.).  Why is Mrs. Pilate in Jerusalem when they lived in Caesarea?  Why are they so damn nice when the Jews are so awful? Since the NT is written in Greek, why not just use a well attested English translation rather than translate into hypothetical First Century (?) Aramaic which is a matter of guesswork and mystification?  Some ofthe actors seem to pronounce it right.  But Caiaphas and Jesus can't even pronounce messiah right (they should say meshiha  [with a het] instead of meshikha [with a khaf].  I know modern Jews make that mistake all the time but why should they.  After all if they don't know how to pronounce messiah who does?     But that is just the beginning.  For example, the Last Supper is weird.  Ok, bread no matzoh, that's John's version.  Then why not use the text of John?.  Instead he uses the words of the synoptics in which it is a seder.  Why is Mary Magdalene the woman caught in adultery in John 6?  No evidence for that. Why doesn't he use the famous words about casting the first stone? (Maybe it's there in Aramaic and I missed It in the general din)  The Herodians are depicted as complete effete decadent homosexual (?) fools.  Not that I would defend that family but I don't want to use homosexual as a villainy in this day and age. There is mortar in the stonework of the temple, stirrups on the horses, and on and on and on.  Obviously the guy has no interest in historicity or even in accuracy to the gospels.  He has subsumed everything into a sickening violent verisimilitude and a made-up Aramaic verisimilitude, a seeming truth without any historical accuracy either to the gospels or to the historical events.     Personally I don't think the violence is realistic at all.  Real violence, as we see it on security cameras, is undramatic, seemingly casual, almost banal and horrifying for that reason alone.  Think of that woman caught beating her child or innumerable murders we see on TV news. He has given us a real horror show that goes beyond any real human endurance to dramatize Isaiah 53:5.  I think it's a snuff film but I don't want to interfere with people who may actually have a legitimate religious reason for watching it.     But what bugs me is that it is combined with real anti-semitism of the most mythological sort--something that makes me meditate on the way in which Satan insinuates himself into even good motives but not in the way that Mel Gibson thinks, rathern in a completely ironic way. Anyway, the whole premise of the film is unhistorical.  Christians apply Isaiah 53 to Jesus.  But that is a later tradition.  The NT doesn't meditate on "by his stripes we are healed."  As I understand Paul and the Gospels, it's Jesus' death (and resurrection) that brings atonement and Isaiah 53 is largely unused in NT tradition.  In Acts, in the scene between Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch, it is used to ask who is the righteous sufferer? Also to proof-text that the messiah must die.  Not until 1 Peter is it used to describe suffering, and it's the suffering and endurance of the of the martyrs, not Jesus' himself that is highlighted.  Obviously it's part of Catholic devotion later but it's not a prominent NT theme.  The NT is interested in the biblical proof that Jesus as messiah must die, not that his torture redeems us.  (To be sure, Paul believe in vicarious atonement but he doesn't use Isaiah 53 to demonstrate it.) . . ."  I'll have my own take on it posted soon. but I think dad pretty much summed it up.

						    Throwing the Dawg a bone.   So Sepdawg has been hounding me to write a defense of strict constructionism over activism in the constitution.  Well Sep, better late than never, but here goes.  Within a democratic society, you don't have a right to agree with every law that's passed, you have a right to have your voice heard in the forming of the laws.  That voice is expressed through the vote.  However, we also recognize that there are certain laws that cannot be changed by a simple vote.  Certain fundamental rights exist regardless of the will of the majority.  for example, even if a large segment of society wished to, it would still be wrong to enslave a minority group, say African Americans.  To avoid such Tyranny of the Majority, we have enshrined these laws-- the Laws which govern what is rightful-- into the constitution.  These are the laws which govern our laws, as such, they exist as a priori to government, itself.  These are the rules which delineate just government from unjust government.    Ok, wierd natural law rant why?  well because it sets out a procedure by which we may change, not just laws, but those Laws which govern them.  As a member of this society, we are bound to respect that procedure.   While this means that certain laws may stay in effect for longer than we'd like, the sacrifice is procedural justice.     What, then, is judical activism if not short-changing that procedure.  The constitution specifically mandates that if you want to change the Law, you have to take a lot of time, convince a supermajority, etc.   An unelected judge, beholden to no people, representative of himself alone, ought not have the power to alter the character of a just regime.  So what are the argument for judicial activism? (I will try not to set up a straw man) 1) constitutional flexibility:  this argument states that societies change, and the law ought to change with it.    I find this argument suspect for a couple of reasons.  First of all, I don't see how judges are arbiters of societal values.  They are individuals, with individual viewpoints, just as likely to be "old and outdated" as "fresh and new."  better that new constitutional rules have a mandate.    but more importantly, there are certain values which don't change, or ought not to change.  No matter how much society as a whole changes, Freedom of Speech will always be a necessary part of a just regime.  Ditto the right to not be enslaved, ditto the right to vote.  Sometimes we need a constitution to restrain an angry society from abusing or attacking a certain ethnic group, oh say arabs.  2) Judicial morality:  I actually think this might be the most persuasive argument for judicial activism, it says that if a Judge sees some wrong, that he can correct, constitutional or no, he ought to.  For example, an Abolitionist judge in Antebellum America shouldn't send an escaped slave home, despite the fugitive slave clause.  that sort of thing.   The counter, i think, is that the judge has to acknowledge where he get's his authority to act.  His position is part of a system of rules and law, and his undercutting that, even for a good purpose, undercuts his own authority to do so.  I think a good analogy, and one that i've used in the past to make this argument, is when Louis XIV declared that Man has the Inalienable right to be free from economic monopolies.  If Louis XIV can understand how his own argument about inalienable rights hinges upon premises which undercut his own power, he would have understood how the fact that He was making that statement is a contradiction (strictly speaking its not a logical X-->~X, call it a Shcrontradiction).    ok, Sep, your go.

						    urlLink   Yet another reason why "no child left behind" is leaving behind children     Something seems unfair about talking about the problems of gifted students when so many are failing even basic skills tests.  However, this feeling disappears when you note, as this NY times article does, that gifted students don't just "make it" on their own, no matter what, but that they also require special treatment.  Gifted students tend to grow bored, alienated, frustrated with the slow pace of education for ordinary students.  One observer notes that gifted students grow up to be 'either unabombers or nuclear scienctists.' That might be a bit of an overstatement, but we might be looking at another 'lost generation' in the making, a generation of intelligent people who feel that society as a whole has failed them.    in the end, all "no child left behind" does is preach the middle of the road--- pass the basics so that you get funding.  With that as the stated goal, no child left behind will leave behind those on the ends.  Not only, as recent studies show, do schools now prevent mainstreaming of special education, but it will hold back the gifted.  What follows is a generation of gifted adults who, because were never allowed to explore their own potential, will feel constantly alienated from society.    To be perfectly fair, the issue isn't entirely the fault of No child left behind.  But the absurd take on educational funding has exaberated the problem-- Remember that one of the promises that the administration made in order to get the bill passed was to increase educational funding.  Instead Junior has held levels constant in most places and reduced it in many.  Schools, now desperate for funding to get the basics passed-- so as to not suffer MORE funding cuts-- cut gifted and talented programs (along with other things that this administration find less than necessary, including arts, music, theatre, and non-sports extracurriculars. . . just an aside).    The NYtimes article concludes by saying that No Child Left Behind preaches that its OK to be mediocre.  That's what struck me.  From an administration that so quickly dismisses any criticism as anti-american, it seems decidedly un-american to me to preach that good is good enough.  America's ideology is, and always has been, to build it stronger, better, faster.  That sentiment is built into our economic system, but also into the American Drive.    Notice, that in the aftermath of the Cold war, when unilateral American Dominance is being questioned, we aren't satisfied to go quietly into the goodnight of old, outdated empires.  Rather we strive to find a new way for us to be global leaders.  Notice that after the burst of the Clinton-era boom, we don't say, "well, it was a good run, nothing lasts forever, now we can get back to being just a pretty big economy."  Rather we call a period of slower growth a "recession."    This is a distinctly American drive; while other cultures certainly don't frown on excellence, everybody else reaches a point of satisfaction, where success becomes Good enough.  Not for us, though.    "Pippin" may teach that its better to fade away then burn out, but is that really what we want to teach our children?

						   Storey challenged me to explain how a vote for Nader was a vote for Bush.  I think this is quite self-evident.  The winner in each district (or state) is decided by plurality-- eg, the person with the most votes for each state get that state's electoral votes.  this means that when two candidates are close to each other in electoral base, they tend to split the vote and let the opposition win.    So, when Storey and other far lefties vote for Nader, instead of Kerry/Edwards/democrat, they increase the chance of Bush winning in that state.    Now, seeing's how that works, tell me storey, you have a choice between Bush or Democrat.  Its true that the two party system stifles third parties.  Tragic, but its the system we live in.  Until you can change the system, live in it.  While the Democrat may not be your ideal, are you really going to argue that he'll be the same as Bush?  maybe you think that's the case.  If so, i will post a laundry list of differences between the democrats and republicans, starting with support for 1) tax cuts, and 2) the patriot act, then if you truly think they're just the same party, I'll cede the point.

						   Personal note:  urlLink New Hobby Idea   so, after conquering the academic world (i have a degree), job market (i have a job), the business world (my company's doing well), and, my artistic endevors (1/4 of the way done with my own hand carved chess set), I would like to tackle the computer world.    As this article as my guide, I want to start building my own computer--- from scratch. MIT guys, and tech people in general, any suggestions?  Philosophical idea for the day:  Speciesism is a prejudice or attitude of bias in favor of the interests of members of ones own species and against those of members of other species. Speciesism is wrong for the same reason racism and sexism are wrong--because all beings interests should count equally. Peter Singer refers to this as the principle of equality. All the arguments to prove human superiority cannot shatter this hard fact: in suffering, the animals are our equals. For any individual who can suffer, the degree of suffering, not the species of the sufferer is what should count -- from  urlLink  animal rights watch   I found this on the Noam Chomsky blog server, and it sort of irks me.  I think i really degrades the reasons why racism and sexism are wrong.    Its not suffering that makes us all equal-- suffering is subjective; S&Mphiles enjoy it, ought they be enslaved?  I think not.  we have rights because we, unlike animals, are beings that can give and understand arguments, and hence, those who would rule us are obliged to give us reasons why they ought rule us.    This isn't an argument about intelligence, even the  urlLink dumbest person in America  deserves rights.  its about reason.   urlLink Even the smartest chimp  doesn't have that capability.    The ability to speak is endemic of that capability-- animals are able to vocalize, make noises, etc. and that makes them able to express pain and pleasure, but the difference is that man has the ability to speak-- to express conceptions of right and wrong-- unique among the animal kingdom.  (read closely here, sepdawg) Even if science is able to explain how this new ability evolved (which i don't think it adequately has), it remains the case: that ability sets us apart and above from the animal kingdom.  I am not a sadistic man; we ought to be humane to animals, not torture them, etc, but I think those obligations come more from an internal obligation that we ahve as people to not act in a way that causes unnecessary suffering.  So if PETA wants to argue that we ought to reform the meat industry, i'm all for it.  if they argue that we're murdering animals, then they can bite me. (forgive the pun)  They say "for any individual who can suffer, the degree of suffering, not the species of the sufferer is what should count."  but what's so special about suffering, people and animals can suffer through no fault of anyone-- sometimes shitty things happen to people; we can come to harm from time to time.  but a harm isn't an injury ( from 2 words: in--not, and juris--justice )  and only creature which can understand right from wrong can be injured.

						    urlLink A Perfect Circle   There's a famous story about an artist proving his worth to the local regent by taking a pen to paper and drawing, freehand, a perfect circle.  that seems to be an analogy to the soon-to-be-launched Gravity Probe B.  According to the NYTimes Article, the experiment, which includes some of the most perfect spheres ever created by human hands (up to 40 atoms out of perfection), is meant to be a final test of Einsteinian relativity.   I certainly don't know enough about the physics to make any sort of statement on that matter (i shall leave that to you crazy MIT folk: Steve, Phil, Unikowski, etc.)  But the NY times seems to think that it was worthwile for technical reasons (eg, much of the technology was cool and inventive) but the science is now outdated.    But much of what nasa does is justified in that manner: much of our best and most commerically viable and necessary technology has come from either directly or indirectly from NASA endevors: velcro, VTOL jets, CD/CD-ROM/DVDs, Cornell's Sci/fi style Nanotech/supersoldier body suit project which Emmanuel told me about.  Even if Einstein is proven wrong, I still think that he ought to be considered one of the greatest scientists and thinkers of all time.  Think about it: we had to create a sphere, perfect within 40 Adoms, to experimentally disprove it.  Moreover, Einstein's ability to wax philosophical in almost legendary;  his famous take on quantum physics seems more philosophical than scientific: God does not play dice with nature.  Its that type of complete creativity that I think we all should praise and strive for.  In honor of the Gravity Probe B, I shall listen exclusively to the band A Perfect Circle for 24 hours.

						    Traldi, the Red-and-White Jesus Flag, Religion, God, and the Universe .  Continued.   Ok, Traldi, you're like a child, wandering into the middle of movie. here are my responses to you. First of all, I'm going to drop the argument surround the Red on the flag.  i think you and I have gotten off topic with it.    But more to the point, i said that "under god" is no worse than "in god we trust," et. al, not to say that those were entangling, and yet somehow ok, but that the mere mention of the word God ISN'T AN ENTANGLEMENT.  you seem to say they are acceptibly entangling because they're not an affirmation of religion.  I would say that affirmation ISN'T the criteria for entanglement in the first place, and that they're essentially the same thing.    What I keep asking for, and you seem unable to grasp, is an explanation why a simple mention of a deity is so inherently religious.  Even people who don't believe in God have to acknowledge some form of creation-- we're here aren't we. . . we didn't happen by spontaneous generation.  A catholic calls it god.  A physicist calls it "the laws of physics" or "the rule of nature." or somehting of that sort (laws of thermodymanics, biochemistry, molecular crapology, whatever) structurally they're both the same.  its some form of belief; ultimately viewing the world through a scientific paradigm is a belief in a particular worldview.    Saying God can have many different meanings.  It could mean a particular god. . . that would be entangling religion and state.  But tipping your hat to the fact that we are imperfect beings seeking a "more perfect union," or that we're cognizcent of the inherent human rights (rights which, until recently, were regarded as SO SACRED that they ought to be revered with something like a religious zelousness)  or that we are better than a country whose guiding principle is a cult of personality (eg the USSR), isn't.  There is the god of religion, the god that acts as a anthropomorphic deity, whom you might see in the cistine chapel, and then, seperate from that, there is the God of the legal realm.  a nondenominational, purely symbolic, creature whose sole purpose is to remind us of that ever important line: men are somewhere between gods and beasts, something better than the animals but not yet self-sufficient gods amongst themselves.  That is the foundation of society, itself, and therefore the basis of just society and just laws.  perhaps the pledge is poorly worded-- actually, even without Under God, its still probably poorly worded (i never really liked the rhythme of the 2nd and 3rd lines anyway) but that doesn't mean that its a violation of the separation between church and state.  i tire of this argument, which will be settled by the supreme court soon anyway.

						    urlLink Jeff Jacobi  of Boston-dot-com accuses Ted Kennedy of being a radical anti-american.    he says, "Kennedy has a long history of opposing American interests in the world."  wow!  Let's arrest him NOW, and throw him in pris. . . well, maybe we're being a little hard.  let's look at what Kennedy  urlLink said    Protection of the Iraqi people from the cruelty of Saddam had become one of the Administration's last remaining rationalizations for going to war. All of the other trumped-up rationalizations have collapsed. Saddam was not on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons. He had no persuasive link to Al Qaeda. He had nothing to do with 9/11. We have found no weapons of mass destruction. So it is human rights that the Administration turned to in order to justify its decision to go to war. On December 24, 2003  the day Saddam was captured  President Bush said, "For the vast majority of Iraqi citizens who wish to live as free men and women, this event brings further assurance that the torture chambers and the secret police are gone forever." On March 19, 2004, President Bush asked: "Who would prefer that Saddam's torture chambers still be open?" Shamefully, we now learn that Saddam's torture chambers reopened under new management  U.S. management.   where's the lie?  is it not in US interests to tell the truth?  but wait, there's more.    silly GOP pundit quotes Kennedy as saying, "This is just a continuation of disaster after disaster in terms of Iraq policy,'' Kennedy seethed. ''We are the most hated nation in the world as a result of this disastrous policy in the prisons. I think our troops are in greater danger than they have been before. I think it's going to be tougher to fight Al Qaeda. I think the chances of another attack here in the United States have been enhanced."  gasp.  except, according to Bush and his jingoist administration, there is a greater threat of attack-- citing unexposed, undocumented, and admittedly vague evidence.    Pundit continues, "During the Cold War, he fought time and time again against US efforts to promote liberty and repel totalitarianism"  what?!?!  that would make Kennedy a traitor.  when did he do such gastly deeds?  "From demanding the abandonment of South Vietnam and Cambodia in the 1970s to advocating a ''nuclear freeze'' in the 1980s. . . Kennedy has repeatedly raised his voice and cast his vote in support of some of the world's worst tyrants. His furious opposition to the current American campaign in Iraq is in keeping with that ignoble record."  well, let's start with the abandoment of South Vietnam.  WE WERE GETTING OUR BUTTS KICKED.  a strategic withdrawl because of millitary collapse that was costing the united states in lives and dollars doesn't seem to me to be opposing US interests.  also, we weren't supposed to be in cambodia in the first place.  that's why they were called "illegal bombings."    A Nuclear Freeze!  perish the thought, because we need to be able to blow up the planet 1004 times instead of 1003 times.  also bear in mind that Reagan signed onto 2 START treaties; so if Kennedy's a traitor for advocating a nuclear freeze, Beloved Reagan must be nothing short of satanic for REDUCING our nuclear stockpile!  but the zit-ooze continues:  ''If Iraq descends into chaos, Iraqis who have sided with the United States will be butchered.... America will cease to be seen as the leader in the world, no matter who is president. The forces of evil - Islamic fanatics and Saddamist killers - will be ascendant in the Middle East. The forces of democracy and liberalism will be defeated.''  Cool.  true.  I agree.  but I don't think saying "STOP TORTURING IRAQI CIVILIANS IN SADDAM'S TORTURE CAMP" really supports descending iraq into chaos.

						   I shall try to write an intelligent post about something which i know virtually nothing about: Longhorn, Microsoft's new UI, which is still about two years away.  However, Emmanuel and I have been talking about it and I think i have a few thoughts (anyone in the know, feel free to correct anything i have to say about it.)  First of all, i find it funny that within two posts, Emmanuel calls it "stupid" and "really excellent technology."  apparently either he's decided he was wrong, or is just plain confused.  Alternatively, maybe its really excellent AND stupid.  both are quite possible--- see the movie Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure for something that is decidedly excellent and stupid.  Regardless, Emmanuel's most recent post on the matter does show, what I think, is the biggest problem Microsoft faces-- and then, i'm going to draw an analog to the Bush Administration.    What Emmanuel says people like Apple, GNOME and Mozilla (who are the biggest potential losers of Longhorn) should do is. . . well, i'll just block quote him here:   If I were Apple, I would push for XAML to be a w3c standard as fast as possible, and make a kick-ass implementation for OS X and then give it away to the open-source community. Make it hard for MS to create Longhorn-only applications by supporting the same technology Longhorn does, and then make your own engine kick ass and get it out before MS does.   Microsoft's biggest problem is open-source technology, because they've decided on a strategy that requires an obsession with keeping their coding secret.  They go after people who reverse engineer (or even seem to) microsoft's programming.  the problem with this strategy is that if there's a problem with the coding (for example, a security bug), they hide it until they can patch it.  Open source, however, has hundrends of thousands of compu-geeks working on it at any given time, and therefore is constantly revamping its own bugs.  But also because open source code is just that, open, security fixes tend not to rely on secrecy-- so you get a much better theoretically sound security program, one which is secure, even if you know how it was made secure.    (update 5/25/04: for a hugely better discussion of open source/~open source, see Adam U.'s blogpost with the linked final paper he wrote for his class. . . relinked  urlLink here  for your websurfing ease.)    now, how is this like the bush administration?  well, the bush administration has become obsessed with secrecy.  Having Bush testify before the 911 committee, or suing to keep the members of the Energy council, in secret is much like Microsoft keeping its code secret and suing anytime anyone wants to look behind it.  and just like microsoft, the problem is that if anyone ever finds out what's behind the lies and secrecy, it really destroys a lot of credibility EVEN IF THERE'S NOTHING REALLY INTERESTING THERE.

						   So with the wedding comming up, I think it'd be appropriate to say a word or two about the bride and groom  Emmanuel's the best man, so he gets to make the speech at the wedding, but this is my blog, so i get to talk about what I want to (so there).  A few people in the world have an uncanny ability to meet someone, and within a few minutes make them feel like they're oldest, best friends.  I know a few people like that. . . (F.X., Louise, Alison, Paige, you four are the first that come to mind.)  I'm not sure if its because we happen to 'click,' and that other people wouldn't feel the same connection, or if its because of who you are. Regardless, this ability is rare and special.  Strangely--or maybe appropriately-- it is found in both Kait and Jerry.    I first met them, a little over a year ago, at the Matrix:reloaded premier.  Watching that movie in the theatre, and hanging out afterwards, I immediately understood why Emmanuel had stayed friends with Jerry (they knew each other in H.S.)-- and why he had become close with Kait.  After moving in next door, and subsequently, hanging out EVERY DAY, it became readily apparent that they were both extrodinary people, and i consider it a privilege call them both friends.    Jerry St. Jacques has an endless pursuit of fun and happiness second to none.  He's always the first to crack a joke, or to make someone smile when their feeling down, to defuse a potentially tense moment with a smile.    Kait Houlihan is more passionate-- about politics and about being a good person.  (not that Jerry's a serial killer or anything).  She is a woman of amazing taste-- who couldn't adore someone that watches MST3K, Twin Peaks, AND the Smurfs.    So I wish both of them the best.  MOZEL TOV.

						   In deference to you being "tired of discussing politics with me," Storey, I shall back off.  Suffice to say for now, that you're probably right in that we'll never agree, being from such different viewpoints.    Consider this my PMR on the matter:  you gave a number of reasons not to vote for Kerry.  fine.  i disagree with most of them, but whatev.  My point wasn't 'vote for kerry,' (although i think any reasonable, semi-literate, and partially educated knucklehead in America should) but that Kerry and Bush are quite different.    I shall, however, continue to discuss what you called vague science stuff-- because i think there's a real bias against science, intellectual advancement, and knowledge in the bush administration that isn't in the kerry campaign.  As Denis Miller points out (and as I have quoted before on this very blog) "America has never been high brow, but our collective cranial ridge is now sloping like the shoulders of the bar boy at the Kennedy compound."  nuff said for now.   I have also picked up a copy of Godel Escher Bach.  I've only just started (i'm on page 15-- which is no small feat, given that i had to read about a hundred pages of introduction to get there.)  So far, he's only talked about Bach and Fredrich the great-- not the Tome of Arcane wisdom that i've heard of the book, but the story he's told about Fredrich the great's reverence for JSBach is quite touching and excellent.  I'm predicting that even if I don't understand any of the deeper analysis about sets, systemic theory, etc (I expect that i won't get all of it, or even most of it) these wierd tangents (which somehow will factor into the main thesis, i'm told) will make the book worthwile.    more to come on the book, as i read.  one final personal note:  probably be a lack of posting until next week.  This weekend is KAIT AND JERRY'S WEDDING!!!  Last night Emmanuel, Crystal and I helped Kait and Jerry with some last minute wedding stuff.  today they, and Emmanuel (who is the best man) are going down to Providence.  excitement!!!

						   Generally I like William Safire.  I enjoy his anti-media conglomorate rants, and I generally think of him as an intelligent conservative.  however, he's just off the mark  urlLink here  where he writes:    Taguba said, "A few soldiers and civilians conspired to abuse. . . ." But the names Taguba's report named were not important enough for those who want to use this scandal to justify their opposition to this war until the nation wearies of the conflict and the Bush administration can be ousted.  Those of us who believe in the nobility of exporting freedom cannot trivialize the scandal. But we need not let our dismay at the predations of some self-photographing creeps overwhelm the morally sound purpose of our antiterror campaign. Nor should the dereliction of some officers detract from the brave and upright service of almost all our warriors.     Look, I generally think the war in Iraq was a good idea, in principle.  removing a despotic military tyrant is a good thing.  But that doesn't give us the right to do whatever the hell we want.  Eventually there must be some accountability.  or as Jason Prestly said, in Tombstone, "we gots to have some law."  at some point a leader. . . or even a secretary of defense to a leader. . . has to say, "the buck stops here, and I am responsible for the men and women under my command, both for their safety and for their actions."  Bush and Rummy have done neither.  Americans are still dying in Iraq and Americans committed terrible acts of cruelty.    What the democrats are angry about isn't just that the abuses happened, but that the administration has allowed a political culture in which such things happen because they have demonized muslims to the point where torture is ok.    However, the bush administration's constant "what, me worry" attitude about any mistake they have made prevents any type of real, meaningful appology-- either to the victims of 9/11 or to the victims of our rampage thereafter.

						    urlLink Guardedly Good News   so the latest NYTimes/CBS polls still show Bush and Kerry in a statistical dead heat (although Kerry is inching his way ahead, almost out of the margin of error without nader, and well inside with).  but the more important analysis are the related polls-- which all show up better for Kerry than Bush. . . questions like "do you approve/disapprove of the way Bush is handling the war in Iraq. these, for the most part show up in Kerry's favor.    but it begs the question, what the hell are people waiting for?  what we see is that the majority of people disapprove of bush's handling of the war in iraq, the economy, healthcare, social issues, the budget defict, taxes, and yet he remains hovering at about 41-45 to Kerry.  the only issue he rates highly on is the war on terrorism, which his numbers are starting to sag, droping to below 60% (they have been up above 65 for most of the year).  and on that 75% or more of people say that they would at least "guardedly trust" Kerry.

						    urlLink   The Moral of the Storey (Clayton, that is)     Dear Storey:  As an avid Blue Pyramid reader, I am disturbed by your constant declarations that Bush and Kerry are the same.  I challenge your assumption that everyone that doesn't simply withdraw our troops from Iraq is a warmongering conservative bent on world domination (much like  urlLink COBRA  or the less well known COBRA-la).  a choice between Bush and Kerry is much more than a choice between Serpentor and Cobra Commander.  Rather, Bush was content to demolish Iraq's government and then pay lip service to rebuilding it.  On the other hand, Kerry recognizes that we're now entrenched, for better or for worse.  American credibility and, indeed, saftey is now tied to the fate of Iraq.  For that, we'll need broader support on the ground in Iraq, to do so would be to invite a civil war in an already unstable area, perhaps spreading-- destabilizing Iran, which is just now showing some promising signs of liberalizing.    Preventing this will require additional troops, but troops of a different sort.  1) more international troops, but more importantly 2) more military core of engineers/civil engineers not bound to Haliburton.  so while its true that Kerry doesn't support Bush's war in Iraq, he cannot simply withdrawl.    But moreover, the differences between their domestic policies is staggering.  Bush favors the oft-maligned (and rightly so) supply side, favoring cushy tax cuts for the wealthy-- see the book "the Price of Loyalty" for a complete description of the rediculous nature of the tax cuts.   Bush and his radical right wing religious conservative allies also are anti abortion rights, anti gay marriage (in any form, civil union or otherwise), anti science, and, if you ask me, anti-reason. certainly he's pro-using government power to intimidate and coerce behavior from private individuals (he's got Karl "Nemesis Enforcer" Rove for that.)  Kerry, on the other hand, is pro-choice, pro-civil unions (i suspect that he's more than that, but for political reasons that's all he can hope for-- much as Lincoln was an abolitionist, but couldn't get more than the border states. . . should we fault someone for compromising in order to get some benefit?), pro-welfare, pro-cutting taxes for the middle class and raising them for the wealthy.  Pro-letting scientific research be done without government interferance, anti-using government power to influence private actor's behavior.  in short, Bush is a fiscal liberal/social conservative, whereas Kerry is a fiscal conservative/social liberal.  that sounds like polar opposites to me.  I'm pro-Kerry, but anyone who's watching this election has to recognize that the radical right wing coup that occured in 2000 is up for grabs this time around, the stakes are high and the two would-be leaders are anything but identical.

						    urlLink Yet another Bush Bashing Bash   or why I  still   hate George W. Bush  Doesn't it say something about our society that Disney is afraid of publishing a movie with a "distinctly partisan feel," not because of its own political leanings, but because they're afraid of losing tax breaks.   I've got my own problems with Michael Moorer-- I think he's typically quite hypocritical in that he uses many of the same tricks, misdirections, and lying techniques that he abhorrs in the political right.  That I tend to agree a little more with his side doesn't mean that those techniques are OK.    However, in a regime that espouses the sanctity of the freedom of the press, it shouldn't be the case that a movie distributer is afraid of losing tax breaks in a NONMOVIE RELATED BUSINESS VENTURE because of the cronyism of the current goverment.    wait, its not just cronyism, its rampant abuse of power too. . . congratulations GWB, you've finally succeded in something: you've beaten out Nixon for the craziest power abuser in the last 50 years.

						    urlLink Are we this starved for real leadership?   I'm not saying that the governator is a bad governor.  that's more a judgement for the people of Cali-- Lauren, you're from cali, yes?  Storey, you too?  I'd actually be a little curious to see what you guys have to say about Arnold.  but i digress.    Its quite odd to see the NYtimes be so flowery about a republican-- even a centrist leaning one.  but the leadership in washington has been so awfully nonexistant that i think we're all a little starved for genuine political leadership.  someone who's willing to engage all sides and then make good decisions rather than-- as Bush seems to be doing-- making a decision before all facts are in and then sticking to it regardless of the consequences.  A real leader shouldn't be afraid to reveal who he's getting advice from.  A real leader shouldn't be afraid to show pictures of the dead soldiers who died fighting for an unpopular war HE started.  and most importantly, a real leader should be able to bridge the divide and engage the opposition party.  bush has done nothing but attack any and all dissenters.    people would talk about Clinton as being a wishy-washy pollster of a president.  I don't think that's quite right.  what he would do is decide that, for example, we needed better education, and then poll for means to that end.  that's fine.  but what Bush is doing, to try and avoid being a pollster, is forget about public opinion alltogether.  I hope that this strategy backfires come november, when public opinion counts the most.

						   I agree, mostly, with Storey about the movie Fahrenheit 911-- except to say, of course, that I don't disagree with Kerry, so i don't agree with Storey about the movie also indicting Kerry for voting for the war.  of course, for someone who WAS for the war, on the grounds that GWB showed us, i can understand how someone might be for the war when presented with the administration's lies, but now, those lies exposed for what they were, opposes the war.  that's not really an indictment of Kerry.  but i don't want to really get into that battle (forgive the pun)with Storey again.  However, there is, I think, something else that should be said about Fahrenheit 911. . . and most of America right now.  Much of the movie showed current bush administration members in the 1980s shaking hands with Saddam Hussein-- clearly an attempt to demonize the Bushies through guilt by association and to show them as hypocrites.    Yes, we supplied weapons to Iraq, and to Osama bin Laden, during the cold war.  but then, we were supporting them against a greater evil in the soviet union.  sometimes you have to pick your geopolitical allies based on a common enemy, not a common ideology.  and politics, as they say, produces strange bedfellows.  but more than that, I think the attempt to demonize the bushies through their association is a mild form of racism:   Look at them haning out with Saudis.  Saudis are muslims. muslims are terrorists, therefore the Bush family has links to Terrorism.     clearly not all saudi arabians are terrorists, any more than all Americans are crazy right-wing Bush style ideologues.  but that idea has prevaded america so much that anyone in a position of power in Saudi Arabia is viewed as tainted.  and while many  may  be supporting terrorists, that doesn't mean that we can assume that power-in-Saudi-Arabia means terrorist supporting.  I would have liked to have heard more about the specific Saudis that the bush family has associations to rather than "They're Saudis. hate them."  personal update:  I am interested in reading  urlLink this  new book which, from its NYT review, will read much like Hari Sheldon might.   quote of the month goes to Phil Larochelle, with the following timeless gem of Zenlike pith: "if you drink the weight of a small dog in alcohol, make sure it all comes back up." Joshu never said it better. "No harm done except for some minor damage to the hedges on some french farms. " No harm, indeed.

						   Happy birthday to me, Happy birthday to me, Happy biiiirrrttthhhday to mee-ee, happy birthday to me.  Yesterday I was talking to the company's ombudsman, a really nice lady named, ah-pre-po (i don't know french) Grace.  we were discussing a particularly loud and obnoxious dispute when i commented that I was in the third grade when the particular defendant (whom we affectionaly call D.) signed the mpn, I was in the third grade. Grace looked at me as if i had just called her a slutty, dirty bitch-crack-whore.  and she can't really be ALL that much older than me. . . maybe in her low 40s, although that's still almost twice my age.    so many people dread the anniversary of their own birth.  Perhaps its because i'm young yet, but I don't.  People fear their impending mortality, but why?  with science advances people are living longer, with a greater quality of life, and more importantly, if you feel good, so what that you've been on this planet N+1 years instead of N.  instead, age ought to be a sign of venerability (is that a word?  like the Venerability of the venerable village elder)  Its true that when George W. Bush is as old as George H.W.Bush is now, he'll still have the intellect of one of Pavlov's dogs, but the mere fact that he's seen 365X70 days is something that ought to be respected.

						   To say that I enjoy reading  urlLink Kristoff's   columns in the New York Times is a misnomer.  He's constantly writing about terrible events-- mass murders, rapes, systematic destruction, every nightmare that we, as Americans, are shielded from.  but while the Bush administration argues over whether or not to call what's happening in Chad/Suddan a "genocide"-- or to use a more politically OK term to ignore, like mass murder, or more dehumanizing "ethnic cleansing"-- Kristoff tells, in part, the story of a woman in the area and how she has, in two weeks, fallen from the richest woman in her tribe (big fish in a little pond) to a refugee, homeless, penniless, and almost raped, murdered, and mutilated (minnow in a veritable pacific of sharks.)    And that, i think, is what made his columns so powerful.  There are things in this world that the human psyche isn't remotely equipped to warp around, and the easiest thing in the world-- somthing that we, Americans have become exceedingly efficient at-- is to divorce any senitment of humanity from far-away atrocities.  Kristoff brings it back by putting a human face.  Its not some wierd government (quote Dave Riordan, "if you're so stupid that you can't think of a good name for your country, so you call it 'CHAD', you might be in the fourth world.") in a place you've never heard of torturing some people you never cared about.  Once again, its about many single individuals, each with individual lives that have been shattered.  Yet, the same people who chided themselves and Clinton about doing nothing in Rwanda-- for once, i'm NOT talking about the rightwingers; although they didn't want to do anything in Rwanda either-- are now doing nothing here.  In Rwanda, they said, "we had no way of knowing what was going on."  (of course, no way of knowing why the Rwandan government would put in an order of several hundred thousand machetes from french contractors.)  but here, there's a difference.  we DO know what's going on, and still we're doing nothing.  In Rwanda, we said we were too overextended; and indeed the same is true now. but we were overextended then because of Kosovo-- a humanitarian intervention which resulted in the capture and ousting of a terrible dictator.  and while we did seem to oust a terrible dictator in Iraq; we don't seem to be as busy rebuilding.  Kosovo proves that we CAN statebuild.  I think that means that we can be held responsible in some moral sense for things that happen while we're quagmired in Iraq-- things that we could have stopped but didn't.

						   Everyone and their mother is talking about Reagan-- and it seems pretty split: democrats are saying that he was a cowboyistic nuclear power addict with a hardon for spending, and that he made it OK to destroy poor people, and that he paved the way for GWB's jingoist nepostist and revolutionary conservative national revolution.  and on the other side Republicans are saying he had a great smile.   ok, that was a bit of a straw man, but i think you can find people on each side saying good/bad things about our departed leader.  as for myself, I have to say that I think he's out JFK'd JFK; which is to say he's a model of style over substance.  As much as I agree with Adam (see his most recent post for a complete and total annihilational deconstruction of Reagan's politics) Reagan still had a postive impact on America.    Although I was only an infant when Reagan took office, from what i've read, the idea was that America was somehow on the decline.  years of stagflation from Carter (who, by the by, was the exact opposite: a good and decent man to whom bad shit happened on his watch. . . at least that's how I see it. .  . i digress)  had taken their toll on american ideological will (not to mention a dragging cold war, and the memories of Korea, Vietnam and the fade of the glory of WWII).  Reagan's administration restored some sense of faith in the American Idea-- not the American Ideal, but the sense that our country is a city on a hill;  that our system is somehow better, set apart from the rest, and as such we are meant to be leaders.  I think that's a good thing, in moderation, of course.  We can't assume we're worthy of leadership.  Certainly our most recent actions in Iraq show we're not.  but it still gives us an ideal-- an image of what we should be, what we can be, and what we need to strive for.  And as for Reagan's legacy, what's so wrong with creating our own heros.  We've been doing it for years:  JFK, who had scarcely the popularity to match WJC at his lowest moments, has been cannonized into the last King Arthur of Camelot.  In China, Deng Xioping has been hailed as the instrument that modernized Mao.  neither is true, but people need their idols-- is it so important for those idols to be real, rather than self-created?  Look at how we're idolizing Reagan.  people are once again calling him "the great communicator," "a peacemaker" (not sure if they mean a man who brings peace, or a reference to the Smith and Wesson gun.) "a Uniter," all these things that we simultaneously need in our leaders and see lacking in our current leadership.  Why is it bad to create for ourselves a hero-- an idol-- of all those aspects of good governance and leadership that we ought to require in ourselves?  Let us have our graven images, our idealized fallen, and our false gods.  They will remind us not what the real men did, but reflect our own wants, desires, and hopes.

						   according to  urlLink this MSN report , we are getting closer to a medically viable face transplant for people who were traumatically disfigured.   note: thank you, MSN, for the amazing graphic that explains what a face transplant is.  For future reference, my IQ is, in fact, over 4.     but taunting MSN's stellar reporting techniques aside, I don't see why this seems to be such a bioethical issue, as MSN claims it is.  Why is a facial skin transplant any different than, say, a liver transplant.  well, perhaps a closer example is a kidney transplant-- an organ that is not medically life-and-death, but the transplant is still net-beneficial to the patient (you CAN live with one kidney, but often doctors will opt for a transplant over mono-renality.) simialrly, the psychological pain of intense disfigurement may be worse than the face transplant procedure and so it should be a viable option in cases where a doctor feels its appropriate.  the "but you may look like someone" made-up ethical dilemma that MSN points out is stupid. . . first of all, people are aware that you are not who you look like-- just because that wierd girl on MTV got plastic surgery to look like mandy moore, doesn't mean she IS mandy moore.  you're not stealing something from someone who donated his/her face to you. Also, even if you are taking some slight part of another's identity, it doesn't fact that we're giving someone who was terribly burned get a chance to live a much more normal life?  that seems worthwhile to me.

						   Adam posts an observation on his  urlLink blog  saying:   Lots of people have speculated as to why Bush remains popular, despite Kerry's huge leads in most individual issues (the economy, taxes, even Iraq at this point.) One idea is that the Republican party has succeeded in making the election about a "story" - that Democrats are terrorist appeasers who will ban small businesses and abolish marriage, and Republicans are the real Americans - while the Democratic party only has a laundry list of policies. This dichotomy seems pretty clear in the political advertising, albeit in the small sample set I have looked at. If Kerry loses to Bush, the Democrats will really need to re-evaluate how they can spread a different conception of American values. They need a broad, long-term strategy, instead of muddling through with unpleasant candidates.    I certainly agree that-- win or lose-- the dems need to reeveluate how they send out their message (perhaps the first step might be to actually have a unified message?)  but here's the problem:  I typically agree more with the DEMs than the GOP.  should I, then, vote for bush in order to force the dems to "re-evaluate" their strategies, and therefore, become a stronger party in the long run?  Just asking the question seems odd to me.  we view voting as an expression of who I want to be MY representative in congress/president/government.  we certainly do attach some kind of moral weight to voting.  but the question would apply to any time where short-term benefits and long-term benefits are mutually exclusive.  for example: drug addicts get short term benefits from their drugs, at a long term cost.  How does one who is a consequentialist weigh these against each other?  clearly there's some sort of weighing mechanism-- a consequentialist would probably want to say that long term addiction is in some sense morally bad. . .or that murdering you (which might give me short term benefits) is bad (probably because of the long term benefits of your life).  would it be entirely a "long term benefits are better than short term benefits" thing?  because then the consequentialist is using some sort of A Priori to say that. . .similarly if its just a 1-to-1 trade off (a priori: long and short term benefits are equivelent).    again, we have to fall back on objective moral truths in order to qualify our practical judgements.  God damm, i hate consequentialism

						    urlLink This dude argues that because of separation of church and state, we need to have public education teach religion.    what?   do people think about these things before they say them?   just to answer and be done with this mental midget:   just because someone is teaching without reference to God, doesn't entail they are teaching GOD DOESNT EXIST.&nbsp; eg: you can teach the pure mechanics of biology without making a claim as to whether or not God created biology. done. that's what Jefferson meant.  Furthermore, doesn't it straight up violate seperation of church and state to only stop classes which teach something counter to christianity?&nbsp; and while we're on the subject, what branch of christianity.&nbsp; last time i checked, Protestants and Catholics had some radically different views, are you going to form a government branch that decides what a legitimate religious/christian view is?&nbsp; that further enmeshes religion in the state, and you're forgetting about a ton of other religions, including Judiasm, hinduism, buddhism, shintoism, and yes, islam too.

						   Adam, who has yet to respond to his own problems with physical appearance, goes on to talk about fate and free will.  So i'd like to talk for a moment about compatiblism-- the view that free will and determinism are not mutually exclusive.&nbsp; I'm certainly not an expert on free will/determinism debate except to say that both do have excellent arguements.&nbsp; For the fate side, it certainly does seem like we can create a very coherant account of how the physical laws might govern our choices; our brains are gigantic electrochemical processing machines, and so we can say that, although we don't know how all the processes work, we can be confident that our consicousness/thoughts are relegated to the sphere of electrochemical impulses which are, in turn, governed by chemistry, physics, and biology style determinism.&nbsp; (this, of course, avoids a massively unproductive debate about God and fate.&nbsp; such arguments almost always devolve into the mystic, which, I think there's a place for, but not here.)  On the flip side, we do seem to have free will-- and many of our actions and beliefs are predicated on free will: the idea that we have choices is inherent to a system of justice, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; An account can clearly be given about free will as an emergent property (greater than the sum of its parts).&nbsp;   Compatibilism, then, is an account which says that the seeming controdiction between free will and fate is only because of a lack of definition.&nbsp; And it might seem reasonable to say something of the following sort:  Say, hypothetically, that Person A loves to go left-- its just his biological makeup that he distrusts right-hand turns.&nbsp; However, even if I know that&nbsp;A will choose to go left every time he comes to a particular intersection, he still has the choice--- it could be the case (without going into a ton of wierd modal theory that i don't really know) that A could have gone right, but he didn't, his choice was left.&nbsp; Although we can be absoulutely certain that he would make that choice, knowing what we do about him, doesn't mean that he didn't have that choice.  it is an interesting view.

						    urlLink This &nbsp;pisses me off. &nbsp; The clear implication is that&nbsp; Kerry is trying to "flipflop" on abortion by presenting a nuanced view of his stance. &nbsp; It seems quite reasonable to me to say, "I don't believe in abortions.&nbsp; but many of you do, and as your representative, I would protect your legal right to have an abortion."&nbsp; in fact, this is how I feel too: that too many abortions happen, but the law isn't the right mechanism to deal with them, it seems way too personal a decision, way too individualized, way too splitting, for the law, which is more of a blunt instrument, to deal with it. &nbsp; or perhaps i might say, as Kerry said:  "I oppose abortion, personally. I don't like abortion. I believe life does begin at conception. But I can't take my Catholic belief, my article of faith, and legislate it on a Protestant or a Jew or an atheist ... who doesn't share it." [Ellipses in original transcript]

						   I happened upon this set of quotations from JFK.&nbsp; I quite enjoyed them.&nbsp; Compare them to a memorable quote (if any) from our current administration.&nbsp; How do they match up?: &nbsp; JFK: If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.   In free society art is not a weapon. Artists are not engineers of the soul.   Communism has never come to power in a country that was not disrupted by war or corruption, or both.   Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all.   Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.   When written in Chinese the word crisis is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity.   Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names.   Our growing softness, our increasing lack of physical fitness, is a menace to our security.   Domestic policy can only defeat us; foreign policy can kill us.   There is always inequality in life. Some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded and some men never leave the country. Life is unfair.   Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.   It is an unfortunate fact that we can secure peace only by preparing for war.   When power leads man towards arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. When power narrows the areas of mans concern, poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses. For art establishes the basic human truth which must serve as the touchstone of our judgment.   When we got into office, the thing that surprised me most was to find that things were just as bad as wed been saying they were.   There is a a terrific disadvantage in not having the abrasive quality of the press applied to you daily. Even though we never like it, and even though we wish they didnt write it, and even though we disapprove, there isnt any doubt that we could not do the job at all in a free society without a very, very active press.   The United States has to move very fast to even stand still.   Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.   We must use time as a tool, not as a couch.   We believe that if men have the talent to invent new machines that put men out of work, they have the talent to put those men back to work.   The ignorance of one voter in a democracy impairs the security of all.   Washington is a city of Southern efficiency and Northern charm.   Im always rather nervous about how you talk about women who are active in politics, whether they want to be talked about as women or as politicians.  &nbsp;  urlLink you can find the GWB intellect here

						   Adam questions if its ok to react differently to people based purely on their physical appearance.&nbsp; what he says is: &nbsp;  "Everyone makes instant personality assessments of people when they meet them, and I have found that my personality assessments are accurate surprisingly frequently. Part of this is that I will react to an attractive person different from an ugly person, rendering my personality assessment a self-fulfilling prophecy; but part of it is that personality really does often correlate with appearance. "  And then goes into a lengthy justification of why its OK to judge people based entirely on physicality. in summary he say a few things: 1) being attractive takes work, and I like people who work at things. 2) a silly genetics-leads-to-good-personality argument 3) attractive people have confidence 4) unattractive people tend to have self-defensive personality traits. &nbsp; to be fair, read his entire post, and not just the taglines i've given him.&nbsp; go  urlLink Here , now.&nbsp; back? ok good. now we can proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; Upfront, i think 1-4 are, in various degrees, based on flawed assumptions.&nbsp; First of all, the core problem with Uni's view is that it assumes that because people tend to judge based on pure appearance that they  SHOULD  do so.&nbsp; All four of those arguments fall away if you accept that it is in someway wrong to, as Kierkagaard (or was it Dick Van Patten) said, "label me, and negate me." (thank you Wayne's World.)&nbsp; and here's a few reasons why this might be the case. &nbsp; it may be trite but beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&nbsp; How many conversations have you had about "is X guy/girl you know attractive."&nbsp; how many times do people have vastly different opinions about that.&nbsp; A few examples:&nbsp; Ally McBeal was considered to be very attractive, but many found her skeletor-esqely hideous.&nbsp; Many other people find Roseanne Bar to be disgustingly unattractive, yet Tom Arnold found her hot enough to produce children with.&nbsp; It would seem wierd, then, to base some sort of judgement of personality on such a subjective thing.&nbsp; Do people's personalities change based on who is looking at them?&nbsp; that would seem wierd.&nbsp; To put it more simply, &nbsp;many attractive people are assholes.&nbsp; many attractive people are quite nice.&nbsp; many unattractive people are assholes.&nbsp; many unattractive people are quite nice.&nbsp; its hard to judge how a person would react to their own physicality-- and their reactant personality traits.  &nbsp; well, that throws out 2,3, and 4. &nbsp; so let's deal with #1.&nbsp; good looking people, according to Adam, tend to be the type of person who puts effort into things, and therefore, are nice, or good people, or some other term of endearment.&nbsp; let's examine what, exactly, Adam says: &nbsp;   Part of it is that attractiveness takes work, and it requires a certain kind of personality to put the time and effort into being attractive. Only a certain type of person will go and lift weights, and lifting weights makes you attractive, so in that sense, one would expect attractiveness and personality to correlate. But body shape is not the only component of beauty - in fact, I'd say a considerable portion of attractiveness is purely innate. Even controlling for body image, I think personality and attractiveness often go hand in hand   Still, &nbsp;it might well be the case that the type of work that goes into body image makes someone's personality LESS good: more vainity, more ego, more narciscism-- its true that those are qualities that many of my good friends possess, but one could see how being a vain, egoistic self-aggrandizing ego queen might turn some people off. &nbsp; I guess, in summary, that I would say the same thing i say about racism: If you look around in this world, you'll see more assholes than a turkish customs agent. so why hate someone based on their skin, when if you take 5 min to get to know them, you'll find so many much better reasons to hate them. &nbsp;

						    Happy Anniversary to Storey and Emily!  &nbsp; I'd like to throw my two cents into the small blograment (1.  N.,  amalgamation of Blog and Argument; 2.  N ., amalgamation of Blog and Sacrament) between  urlLink Andrew  and  urlLink Lauren &nbsp;on the subject of Moral Relativism.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Kantian that I am, I have a deep, deep, deep distrust of relativistic stances, cultural and otherwise.  &nbsp;  My thoughts on the matter of relativism in general fall somewhere along the lines of, well, if we can base our moral systems on something that is universal to all mankind, (eg rationality and free will) then cultural matters drop away and we have our universal truths.&nbsp; but let that go for now.&nbsp; Instead of building my own case, I want to trash someone else's.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So Sep, quite adeptly, characterizes relativism (read his post).&nbsp; As an afterthought (where I usually find problem with what people say), Sep says, "note that it is different from moral nihilism (the belief that there is no morality in the normative sense) and moral subjectivism (the belief, often confused with relativism, that moral beliefs are only true/false in light of ONE's OWN passions). . ."&nbsp; Clearly relativism is different from nihilism?&nbsp;The view that says "morality has a property of being contrived by local societies" is different from one which says "no morality exists" only if you've already accepted as a premise a specific definition of what morality is. (you might be saying, 'Huh?' i shall explain. . ."&nbsp; Many philosophers have held throughout the ages that part of morality is universality, in the sense that part of "JOKE" is "FUNNY."&nbsp; that part of the concept of morality is its universality, or more specifically that universality is a definitionally important aspect of morality.&nbsp; if this is the case, then saying that there is no universality in morality is sort of like saying "~X is part of X," or saying nothing at all, if you think a contradictory statement is meaningless.  &nbsp;  that's thought one.  &nbsp;  thought two is that I'm a little confused by Sep's description separating moral relativity from moral subjectivity, because i think its part of the problem with de-universalizing moral theories in general-- note: the following statement is NOT&nbsp;flushed out philosophical belief, just sort of a thought that's been floating around in my head-- we can't really escape universal moral judgments, even when we're trying to make relavistic statements.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For example.&nbsp; the distinction between relativism and subjectivism is that the society, rather than the individual, makes the moral judgment (makes, in the sense of creates) in relativism, and the individual, rather than society as a whole creates morality in subjectivism.&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all,&nbsp;Lauren points out the first problem, which is that it is hard to determine what the society as a while feels anyway:&nbsp;what is the proper percentage for a moral value:&nbsp; 100?&nbsp;&nbsp;50+1?&nbsp;&nbsp;66?&nbsp;&nbsp;60?&nbsp;&nbsp;and what of those&nbsp;who disagree with the society (the other&nbsp;49.9%).&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; but this leads into what I think is a deeper critique of relativistic stances, which is: what rule, what moral law, what code tells you that the cultural is more important than the individual.&nbsp; The best I can think of is something along the lines of 'its more democratic that way,' but that already presupposes a democratic truth which exists outside relativistic space, in which case the relativist has already ceeded the most important argument: that there exist univseral truths.&nbsp;  &nbsp; or, as sep points out, it could be something along the lines of a contract: that a culture contracts itself to certain morals.&nbsp; again, why does that work for a culture, but not the individual.&nbsp;  I  did not contract to any particular moral, therefore why does it apply to me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; In the end, there are just too many controdictions, too many paradoxes.&nbsp; there must exist an objective moral code.

						   The recent pick of John Edwards (which, I think, is a massive asset to the dems, and creating a hugely powerful ticket-- one which, I'd play slightly better than even odds for winning in november) underscores one of the most divisive issues to the Dem party in America: Globalization.  Kerry, as a successor to the Clintonites, has been pro, claims that it allows the US to specialize, and bring democratizing capital to the third world; Edwards, whose mildly protectionist rhetoric during the debates shows him as more of a anti, claims that it ends up forcing the US to be friends with some rather unscrupulous people, and allows more outsourcing.  There are clear economic and political advantages to globalization-- it allows the US to cut costs by using cheaper international labor, but supply-side economics only goes so far.  it does create a intricate web of dependencies which the US benefits from as much as it forces us into certain. . . strange alliances. . ahem Saudi Arabia.  But on the foreign side, third world labor markets benefit immensely from American investments, specifically because they don't have as many regulations governing treatement of workers, minimum wage, etc.  and that may be a potential human rights disaster in which the United States economy is complicit, or worse encouraging.    But with a strong ticket that combines both pro-globalizing and mildly protectionist policitians, and with an entirely gun-ho corporate globalizing ticket on the other side, it seems rather unlikely that the United States will do anything to jepordize global capital in the next four years.  Regardless of your stance on the globalization of capital, what clearly needs to happen is some form of global oversight of third world markets-- to make sure that, while values about how much minimum wage should be, or if it should be at all, nobody becomes a virtual surf in a third world feifdom headed by terrible people with penchants for using American capital to finance further abuses.    But this cannot be done unilaterally-  no single nation, especially not the United States at this time, has the power, influence or support to either start an oversight body or empower the current. . . shall I say fledgling. . . oversight bodies to do what needs to be done.

						   I saw Spiderman 2 this weekend.    Wow. its quite rare that a sequel comes out that's better than the original.  the special effects were simply breathtaking, and the cast is amazing--  urlLink Alfred Molina , as Doctor Otto "Doc Ock" Octavius, is more than just good as a villian, but downright scary at times.  But this take on spiderman is the real strength of the movie-- that, to steal a joke from the first movie, he's not superman.  the fact that so much time is spent on his personal dillema, one which haunts Parker from the moment he's bitten by that radioactive spider, whether to go after the villian or to go after his love, the always beautiful and fiesty redhead Mary Jane Watson.   I recommend the movie to anyone, and I plan on seeing it again.

						   In this post i'm going to line by line respond to Slate's scathing review of the Michael Moore controversy.  you can find Hitchen's review  urlLink here   Hitchen starts off with a stupidly sarcastic opening line, asking who is the Left's Rush Limbaugh.  Seems to me that the only thing Moore and Rush have in common is being fat, something that also many others have in common with both of them.  so after a slew of ad hominem attacks (this movie is "moral frivolity," "To describe this film as a piece of crap would be to run the risk of a discourse that would never again rise above the excremental." etc.)  Hitchens gets to his actual analysis.   "In late 2002, almost a year after the al-Qaida assault on American society, I had an onstage debate with Michael Moore at the Telluride Film Festival. In the course of this exchange, he stated his view that Osama Bin Laden should be considered innocent until proven guilty. This was, he said, the American way. The intervention in Afghanistan, he maintained, had been at least to that extent unjustified. SomethingI cannot guess what, since we knew as much then as we do nowhas since apparently persuaded Moore that Osama Bin Laden is as guilty as hell. Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous "distraction" from the fight against him.    1) it did seem, at first, that we were rushing off to blame AlQaida militants for 9/11.  although it turns out to be true, Moore often points out that the Press in this country doesn't ask the Bush government hard questions and lets them get away with way too much.  it doesn't seem too illegitimate to say "well let's be sure who just punched us before we pull out our bazoka."  2) since late 2002, A TON OF NEW INFORMATION HAS COME OUT CONFIRMING BIN LADEN'S ROLE IN 9/11.    3) there is no indication that Iraq had anything to do with 9/11, or terrorists at all, so if the war on Iraq is diverting troops and resources from fighting Al Qaida, then it should be viewed as a distraction from the real danger facing america. what's so wrong with that.  Hitchen next brushes over a bunch of points in the movie, in something resembling the argumentation, in the way that a peapod might resemble the virgin mary:   Fahrenheit 9/11 makes the following points about Bin Laden and about Afghanistan, and makes them in this order:  1) The Bin Laden family (if not exactly Osama himself) had a close if convoluted business relationship with the Bush family, through the Carlyle Group.   2) Saudi capital in general is a very large element of foreign investment in the United States.  3) The Unocal company in Texas had been willing to discuss a gas pipeline across Afghanistan with the Taliban, as had other vested interests.  4) The Bush administration sent far too few ground troops to Afghanistan and thus allowed far too many Taliban and al-Qaida members to escape.  5) The Afghan government, in supporting the coalition in Iraq, was purely risible in that its non-army was purely American.  6) The American lives lost in Afghanistan have been wasted. (This I divine from the fact that this supposedly "antiwar" film is dedicated ruefully to all those killed there, as well as in Iraq.)  It must be evident to anyone, despite the rapid-fire way in which Moore's direction eases the audience hastily past the contradictions, that these discrepant scatter shots do not cohere at any point.   you're right, they don't cohere into one point.  they cohere into many.    1,2, and 3 show an alternate agenda the bush family might have for forcing a culture war in Iraq.  I think Moore showed how the Carlyle group, Bush's family, et.al made a ton of money off of government weapons contracts and it certainly does call into question Bush's credibility if not his motives.  4) I hate this argument more than I hate root canals.  Clearly, someone might argue on TWO different levels, saying "we shouldn't be in Iraq in the first place. but since we apparently are going in anyway, we should do it right, and send in enough troops to be effective."  5) not really an argument at all, but more like a bit of sarcastic witticism.  but also points out how flimsy the coalition of the willing actually is beyond the US and Britian.  6) Hitchens is a complete shithead. (this i divine from the fact that his sixth argument is a total load of crap that deserves neither time nor argument. you should be able to see why it should be dismissed on face.)  but if you are obtuse enough to think that its a good argument, here's the counter:  Moore also didn't dedicate his movie to cancer patients, does that mean he's for cancer?  Hitchen then tries to put together some conflicting arguments. . . well, first i'd say that Moore often uses conflicting arguments to illustrate different aspects of the same point.  but let that go, because i don't think Hitchens point out any.  more to come.  wait, before i go home for the day, I want to point out the worst false dichotomy i have ever seen:    Bush is shown frozen on his chair at the infant school in Florida, looking stunned and useless for seven whole minutes after the news of the second plane on 9/11. Many are those who say that he should have leaped from his stool, adopted a Russell Crowe stance, and gone to work. I could even wish that myself. But if he had done any such thing then (as he did with his "Let's roll" and "dead or alive" remarks a month later), half the Michael Moore community would now be calling him a man who went to war on a hectic, crazed impulse.    indeed we would, because, as president, Bush should NEITHER sit back for seven minutes doing nothing while our country is under attack-- especially given recent findings that show how inept our response was-- NOR should he haphazardly go to war, randomly attacking a country which has nothing to do with the war on terror, but will make Bush's family a hell of a lot of money.

						   That title is a bit of a lie. If someone put a gun to my head and forced me to pick one of the two major parties (perhaps the wierdest mugging ever!) I'd probably say "democrat," and count my self a conservative democrat. Still, while my feet are nailed (that sounds too messianic, let's say 'Planted,' instead) firmly in the middle, my head-- and heart-- often pulls me slightly to one side or the other from time to time. (to the left on social issues, and to the right on fiscal matters)  The problem, as I see it, is adherance to politics as a dogma: too many people have adopted "the welfare state," or "smaller government" as an Ideology, rather than a pragmatic solution to a societal ill. I would say that we all have certain goals for what society should be, and, i would guess that, despite some minor differences, they would all resemble the same thing. (my libertarian friends-- most notably Julian and Amy (further sidenote: Julian, that your blogs--www.juliansanches.com AND r:h&r-- don't appear on my roll to the side is a terrible oversight, to be corrected soon enough) and my Hippy friends, most notably Storey and--slightly less so--Emily MIGHT be the exceptions to that rule. But libertarians and hippies have always been slightly off the left-center-right axis)  Take, for example, the idea of a social safety net. I think that even the most staunch republican and the most bleeding heart liberal would agree that its good for society to not have people starving on the streets, homeless despite a job, etc. and, indeed, that is a goal, perhaps one of the most important goals, of a just goverment: social order. Where the left and right differ is how to acheive that goal. each side would propose a different way to get to that goal: a giant subsidized housing program, perhaps; or for the right, a decentralized, state-by-state approach, maybe even organized through a church or two. Obviously i've pigeonholed both sides here, but i'm trying to make a point, not a policy.  The problem comes when we stop thinking of those remedies as remedies and start thinking of them as the goal, themselves. We don't, and shouldn't, want government programs (or lack thereof) for themselves, but rather, because they acheive (or don't) a particular societal goal.  To that end, I'll never preach "big government spending," or "tax-and-spend" or "supply-side economics" or "more local control" of any policy as the good, in and of itself. If you can show me a huge government program that both runs smoothly, with little waste, and provides for the common good, I'll probably support it. But, say, then, a more conservative policy wonk shows up and provides me with a better, more efficent, decentralized approach, i'd probably swich my vote. and then when the liberal comes back with a better still system, i'd flip-flop back again.  the point isn't to adhere to policy no matter the cost. When did the policy, itself, become a surrogate for the idea behind it?  update: according to the Self-Advocates.com political leanings quiz:  Your Political Philosophy According to your answers, your political philosophy is: centrist   Centrist   style="font-family:Arial;"> Centrists favor selective government intervention and emphasize what they commonly describe as "practical solutions"to current problems. They tend to keep an open mind on political issues. Manycentrists feel that government serves as a check on excessive liberty  ps: does anyone else think they misnamed the soon-to-follow-Hurricane-Bonny?  it's named Charlie.  it should have been named Clyde.

						   So rereading the Wastelands, by Stephen King, in preparation for the final chapters of the Dark Tower Series, I've started thinking more about riddles. so here's a few, reposted from Amherst's Planworld (my amherst-only blog):  a few riddles for everyone:  I'm walking down the street with my friend, and i ask him how his threedaughters are doing. He says they're fine, and I, being the nice guy that iam, ask how old they are. Now, my friend is a bit of an ass, so rather thantelling me he says the following:  well, the product of their ages is 36 (whole numbers only) and the sum isthe number of the house I grew up in. i think for a moment and say, "there's no way I can figure that out withoutmore information."  my friend replies, "ok, my youngest daughter's hair isred." "Aha," i immediately reply, "i know how old they are." how old are they?  2. A man is running away from home. A second man is running after him. The second man is wearing a mask. Who are they and where are they going?  3.Two identical twins (biologically and physicallyidentical) go into acorner candy store and each orders a glass of soda. The contents of the glasses are identical. Each twin drinks the soda and finishes it. One twin lives and one twin dies. Why?  4.A man is in the desert. In the distance he sees arefreshment stand. Hewalks in and says to the attendant, Please, please, a glass of water. Theattendant takes out a gun and fires three shots in the air. The man aid,Thank you, and left satisfied. How come he was satisfied by the gun shots when he really wanted a glass of water?  5. man sitting on a park bench reads a newspaper article headlined "Death at Sea" and knows a murder has been committed.  how does he know?  Stand, and speak true.
