      Hello all...   Hope this finds you all doing well.  Today was pretty uneventful.  Short meeting this morning, ended not going to ITS today since i feel like absolute garbage still.  I got a new computer today at work, so i spent that time in the office setting it up since i didnt feel up to walking to my car to drive home.  I could sit and play with my new mac rather then go home and.....do nothing.  Some bumps at work, some days it really sucks, some days its great.  Got a new John Mayer live CD and Jason Mraz's disc, hopefully i can check those out soon.  Im pretty excited to hear both.  I also finally broke down and got a headset for my cell phone since i do alot of travelling and talking.  Figured it be worth the money.  Been a pretty low key day, but with some positives and negatives.  Hopefully things will work out better tomorrow.  Then again, who knows.  Leave me some cheerful tags, i could use em...  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: New G4 desktop at work Negative: Ugh...dont want to get into it.

      I KNOW FRANKLIN.  I was sick as anyones business last nite and couldnt drag myself to the computer to do a blog entry.  Not that it would be overly exciting anyways.  So heres a double dose of blog for all you faithful readers out there.  Took my management 300 exam yesterday morning.  I think i did pretty well on it, however, who knows.  I think my goal now is to see how hard i can work at school and fail out.  I dont know what else i can do besides work 12 hours a day and study 12 hours a day.  I feel so damn drained but it doesnt matter.  20 Credit hours of school is enough to kill some people, but working 40 on top of that, sure its stupid, but i have bills to pay and i cant cut hours at work to study more.  I'm really at a crux.  But ill talk about this garbage alittle later.  Border classes...always fun.  Fun cause i learn in there, not constantly think...man, i have to remember this cause kolla will broadside me with this on a test.  Finally had some good news, though.  Mike(my boss at RCC, i know..another mike) cancelled one of our weekly meetings, thank god.  Sure, its one hour extra a week, but looking at my schedule, one hour is an eternity to get stuff done.  I got home, felt terrible, was looking forward to doing some work(uh, that came out wrong) watching the west wing and law and order and going to bed.  Yah, well...NBC died in the middle of the west wing, so...screw that.  Wags was in bed by 11.  However i did get my advance copy of the Two Towers dvd to play on my PC, so i watched some of that to relax.  By the time i went to bed, i had a MEAN fever, was sweating and coughing like it was my job.  Woke up this morning feeling like i was dead.  My boss at ITS told me yesterday that i shouldnt come in if i felt bad.  So i emailed him and stayed home.  Spent the morning trying to rest, but it didnt really work out that way.  I went in to class at 1130, got another exam back i bombed which im so thrilled about.  Figured what the hell, im on campus, ill go to ITS.  Maybe itll keep my mind off things.  Too bad i get there and find out how i botched up 2 peoples machines the day previous.  I thought i had fixed them, but instead, it made more work for someone else who had to go out and repair what i had done.  So i sat there for an hour, fixed some disks...then back to class.  Worked on a lab for ECT 453 that is making no sense.  I didnt learn anything because before my lab, i got to go talk to dr kolla again.  This time about a class i took an incomplete in last semester AS PER HIS IDEA so that i wouldnt have to drop it and could make my work up from time off from surgery easier.  So instead, he told me 2 weeks ago that it had to all be done by tomorrow.  I didnt think it would be a problem and started working on the work that day.  Then the next day, he assigns 2 homework assignments and 2 exams for that time period as well.  Then i get 2 exams from dr border and an exam in management.  Plus all the garbage at work, me getting the flu, i kind of got behind.  So i asked him if he could extend the deadline.  He said ok...then told me when he would extend it to.  December.  Yes, thats right.  I should graduate in august.  So why would he extend it to december?  He proceeded to go on a rant about how he doesnt think im going to pass his two classes and how he thinks im not going to pass the classes i need to graduate this summer.  Ok, so i know i bombed the first 2 exams of his, but how can he tell me this stuff?  Ive had 2 classes with the guy, one i got a B, the other i took the I since i had surgery, then these!  My in major GPA is a 3.6 and ive worked my ass off for 2 years with this major.  Now suddenly im a shitty student?  The other thing he failed to realize is that after august, my scholarship runs out and i most likely wont be able to afford to go to school here.  THIS IS MY LAST CHANCE.  But he doesnt care, he has his ways set and his attitude set, so screw the world.  Now im at home, and im not even going to get into any of that.  I need to de stress, but apparently i cant do that.  I guess tonite ill have to sit and stare at the wall.  I dont know, i hate bitching about these things, but it just seems like lately more and more roadblocks keep getting placed in front of me.  I work damn hard, i do everything im supposed to do, but barely anything works out the the way its supposed to.  People who i thought i knew have changed so much its scary.  People who act as though they are always there for you and want to talk about problems are such a farce.  Most people just want to seem like they care so that youll do things for them.  People who claim they arent selfish but if its not their way or if you do something that isnt how they do it, dammit you are such a screw up.  Im tired of being judged by my so called friends, im tired of people judging what i do, how i act or what i say.  I thought people were supposed to be accepting rather then picking out every single fault.  I thought people who say they are accomodating only do what they want to do and want to use you for things they want to do.  Other then that you are there as a resource for them.  Not as a person.  Ok, im done with that.  Im so frustrated right now i could explode.  i dont even think talking about it will help since i dont know anyone who would really take anything about me to heart anymore and would do anything for me like i would for them.  Screw it.  Hopefully ill have a happier blog later. ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: Hmm....at least im not dead.

      BLOG, BLOG, BLOGGIN ON HEAVENS DOOR!!!  Hey all...wags here as usual.  What a day.  I survived.  The flu is back in my body with full force.  Meetings this morning...so frustrating at times.  Ugh.  Somedays i dont mind workin, some others i just go nutty.  Today was the latter rather then the former.  Class?  Exam in ECT 300?  Destruction?  Yah.  I just for once would like a Kolla exam where i would come out going...GODDAMN.  I ACED THAT DAMN THING.  Will it ever happen?  never ever.  Got my Exam back from 453.  Didnt do well on it.  I dont get it.  Makes no sense.  No matter how hard i work in those classes, i just get screwed.  Makes me wonder why i work.  Good times with e. schrades this afternoon at work.  He always puts me in a better mood.  maybe its the belt buckles or his dry wit, but that kid sure can pick me up when im down.  Thanks Eric.  Gonna miss you when yer gone.  And i dont mean that homosexually.  Tonite, did some work and fixed ole josh malcoms computer.  Spyware and registry errors had taken his machine over.  Hope its runnin better now.  Spyware = tha devil.  Remember that kids.  Spyware bad.  24 was good as usual.  Is it bad that i kind of want the bomb to go off?  meh...  So, apparently one of our cats is writing songs for me.  Heres a little excerpt...   PimpSLAYER187: toad just made another song for you Waggoner98: oh yah? Waggoner98: scribbled on paper again? PimpSLAYER187: no PimpSLAYER187: she uses the computer now PimpSLAYER187: here, she wants to send it too you PimpSLAYER187:   I got a fuzzy cat and her name is toad becareful now or else she'll explode, with a puddle o piss, and then she'll get mad  and hiss  meow meow meow meow  meow meow meow meow meow meow  And here is the published version of "Barkin in the woods" By Toad   who's that barkin deep in the woods oh my word it is the mountain toad.  jumpin through the air with the blonde foot she'll stomp on yo ass and make you wack.  with the furry fur she make you cough then its in your eyes and you can't see blined by the light and then she'll pee all over the floor and then you'll slip  she will bark and call you jack and you'll try to give her a wack  but she'll bounce to the tree, just like when you set some birds free...    Wow.  On THAT note, im off to study for my management midterm then sleepy wags.   ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: Its tuesday...that means...24!

      “A Well Thought-Out Englilsh Paper” by: Kyle “The Yellow Dart” Smith  	     Since maybe like the Middle Ages, there have been many differing opinions about    hustle and bustle. This cannot be denied. It is my intention to sit down and play video    games for several hours.   	      	 First, moving around quickly, and with purpose, is a true sign of character.    Secondarily, bustle(e.g. hustle) yields more product for the working types. “Hustle and    bustle are like my right and left arms,” said Li’l Spicy in his famous “Hustle and Bustle    Are Like My Right and Left Arms” speech. Webster’s defines bustle as “excited and    often noisy activity; a stir.”  A stir, indeed. Finally, sometimes gross stuff can be funny. 	   In conclusion, I, “The Yellow Dart,” think I have done a great job illustrating the    many differing opinions about hustle and bustle, may they both rest in peace. Also, I    think Strong Bad should decrease The Cheat’s allowance.

      Ugh.  What a day.  I slept like shit last night, it was pretty bad.  Id say overall i got about 2 hours of sleep.  Oh well.  Up at 645 as usual.  Off to class by 8.  Once i got there, overla reminded me that we had this labview seminar put on by National Instruments that we signed up for from 9-noon.  So, we left management early, and spent the rest of the morning doing that stuff.  Not bad, learned more in 1 morning of that then the entire semester so far of ECT 453(which kolla teaches labview).  Lunch was cool, went and got a salad at wendys with overla and talked about more inane bullshit.  It snowed probably another 4 inches today, making walking so frigging hard.  Ugh.  Afternoon, we had another labview seminar, but i could only stay from 1-215, then i worked at ITS from 215-415.  I was looking forward to going since mccomas would have good stories for me on what happened to him when he got home.  Nonetheless, i walk into TSC....no mike.  I talk to chad, and apparently he slipped saturday night at his girlfriends kitchen, hit his head on the counter, got a concussion and was knocked out.  I had to tell everyone why i felt partially responsible since i was buying him drinks that night like it was going out of style, and they all thought it was funny.  415 rolls around and i was getting ready to go to class....and guess who shows up...none other then mccomas.  He was the most softspoken ive ever heard him.  I felt bad for the guy, walked with him to his class then went to my last class of the day.  Nice and sunny out...ahh.  Class ended, and overla and i went to walk out of the tech building....and its snowing again.  SNOWING.  As if we didnt get enough this morning or during the blizzard the past 2 days.  So i had to go to meijer and get some food and stuff.  BTW, i got a nice remington beard trimmer, used it on the goatee today, looks alot better now i think :)  Called mom and talked to her a bit about my huge ass tax refund thats comin.  Ran into an old buddy from my frosh year who now works at meijer, Mark Horak, it was good to see him and BS for a while.  After that, went home, made some steak, watched some boston public then had another meeting tonite.  Wow what a meeting.  Someone quit work today, i had to let someone go and sloka got promoted.  Good for sloka, bad for wags.  Im so proud of him, hes such a hard worker and a smart guy, the new database job will be so much better for him.  Just sucks it has to happen when we are as short staffed as we are.  Ill miss supervising sloka :(  I got reamed out tonite with tons of questions on why RCC does what it does now from people.  Lots of good input, some input i didnt agree with but i think overall it helped.  Talked about the new structure and where RCC is going next year and tried to get a sense of who would be coming back and who wouldnt be.  Im suprised to see who isnt coming back next year, but i wish them all luck in their endeavours.  So here i am, its 1230am, and i havent done any studying for my ECT 300 exam tomorrow at 1130.  Or any prep for my senior staff meeting.  Or the Senior Coordinator meeting.  Or my 1 on 1 meeting with garret, or leah or eric.  Ugh.  Am i going straight to bed?  You bet.  Nite all, send me some lovin, wags could REALLY use it about now. ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: Goatee looks better now, thanks to ole remington Negative: Work.

      So....sitting here watching the grammys....this is how i know im getting old.  Theres some artists on here that i dont really get.  Dixie chicks....i dont know, they arent bad, they just dont do anything for me.  Avril levigne...i dont know.  Shes nothing special.  Some girl whos real cagy and can sing half decent.  Bruce springsteen...good music, but it looks like it hurts him to sing.  However....id like to give a huge I TOLD YOU SO to everyone.  My boy, John Mayer won a grammy tonite...ive been listening to him for 2 years, seen him in clubs.  I remember when id say john mayer, and id hear...john who?  Im proud of him, granted he won for a song that isnt really my favorite, but at least he gets recognition.  Now, i know this means its going to get harder to see him live...grrrrr  Last night....hmm, where should i start?  How about right after i posted my last blog entry.  After i posted, i did some more work...then all hell broke loose.  Like tons and tons and tons of snow.  It snowed from about 12pm to about 4am straight hard.  I think we got a total of about 8-10 inches, but there were drifts over a foot.  THEN our firewall/dhcp sercer took a dump and i had no way to do work i needed to do.  Of course, stupid BG DOT wont plow ever, so it was heinous out.  But like i always stay, drive smart and yer fine.  One of my employees ended up calling me because she was sick.  I felt so bad for her, shes been sick for a while.  I told her that i would help her out and would do her rounds at night.  I braved the snow, did them then...it was go time.  Met up with jen and scott after midnite, got a call from mike mccomas(from ITS) and we ended up meeting up at sky bar.  It was a very different crowd out there, and damn did mccomas get WASTED.  It was pretty funny to see him.  Took him, his lovely girlfriend, scott and jen home then stayed up till 4 watching tv.  Figures, its the weekend, and i couldnt sleep.  Meh.  Got up at 10, did more work today, meetings and what not.  Now i think im gonna go watch the rest of the grammys and head off to bed.  Till tomorrow, yall...asterissssssssskkkkssssss  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: Seeing McComas trashed out of his brain  Negative: SCREW THA SNOW Quote: "Let me hhellllp" - McComas right before he fell on my car when i was dusting off my windows Song of the day: Let it snow....

      Hey all, hope you had a wonderful friday...i sure as hell did :)  Had a good day.  Meetings at RCC went really well in the morning, we were for once able to get through our entire agenda while all AC's could be there.  I was shocked! :)  After that...went to ITS.  I love working at ITS, i dont think i can tell you guys that enough.  I spent the morning doing what i normally do, go over to see whats wrong in my 2 buildings, Moesely Hall and University Hall.  Are they really my buildings?  No, cause im not a full time TSS, but since 90% of all the computers over there are macs, im the man for the job.  So chad assigns me all the trouble tickets for me over there, and now they all love me for being their mac hero.  I think they are starting to know when i work and are calling TSC asking specifically for me now...kind of cool, i like working a job where i feel appreciated. :)    Spent the better part of the afternoon screwing around with Mike McComas(i know i know too many mikes) who is the TSS for Hayes, but also is chad's right hand man.  He's kind of one of my boss's but not really.  At any rate, hes about 26 and cool as hell.  We sat around the office, answering phones, working on peoples dead zip disks and floppy disks and i worked on training.  We both were feeling the friday vibe pretty strongly.  Both wanted to get out of there, getting pretty slap happy and making the dumbest jokes ever.  Having to deal with some real priceless clients topped it off too, lol....  Came home, did some work...then did what i was looking forward to all week.  Kamis...wooooooo.  Finally had a chance to forget about all the stress of the week, and go out and just relax at my favorite BG bar, talk to my other friend mike(from class).  Elo, Kristen, her friend Kristen and i went out, ended up meeting up with BIll, stephanie, hooper and some of their friends.  Next thing i know, Melanie(another friend from ITS slide tackles me from the back) and i end up buying her a beer and talking to her for about a half hour.  After going back and hanging with the original crew i came with, then guess who shows up...Mike from ITS.  From that point on, the whole nite was just rediculous.  He and i ended up doing shots of Jager, doing stupid shit, talking about stupid shit, it was just plain awesome.  I got at the bar at 1015, and left at 230.  Yah, thats right, we closed kamis down.  Thats definately a first for me.  What a time it was.  The weston crew showed up, even lynne who never comes out anymore, hehe.  Had an awesome awesome time.  Ran into Kristin McDonald, Chrissann, Wozniak and tons of other assorted friends i havent seen in forever.  I also ran into a girl i knew my freshman year, Katy who i havent seen in forever.  She gave me her phone number and told me to call her up sometime, i gave her mine too, so this could be interesting...  Came home, went to bed...slept till noon since i didnt get to bed till about 330.  What a nite.  All ive done so far today is work on RCC stuff, big meetings AGAIN tomorrow night and monday night.  Give me a holla if you wanna chat.  IM, phone, etc, you all know tha drill.  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: WHAT A NITE!

      Well, this is later then id like it to be....  Ive come down with some kind of flu the past couple of days...just what i need at this time of the year, wow how i love it.  Ive linked to Josh Franklins blog on my link section.  That guy is one of the funniest dudes i know, im sure his blog will reflect that and make us all laugh our asses off.  Had a long day, still feeling the stomach flu ive had for the past few days..I think today is the first time ive had a boss tell me to go home from work to rest and i said no.  I appreciated his compassion, but i only worked 8-11AM, was already up and had classes and an exam in the afternoon.  I survived.  Once i got home, now thats a different story.  Goddamn ECT 453.  I hate that class.  I hate going into an exam that ive studied and studied and studied for and still feeling completely unprepared for it.  Oh well, as Phil told me today "Its just a f!@#$%& test, not the end of the world.  If everyone did as bad as we think we did, well be fine"  It sucks when you have to have that attitude from a class.  I just keep telling myself, these are my last 2 kolla tests, heres to getting through them.  As steve used to say, D is for done...  I had full intention of going to Phi Mu Alpha tonight, but now that i feel like an alien is going to erupt out of my stomach, doesnt look like its going to happen.  I got an 8am meeting to prep for as per usual, and with the boss out on vacation, its all my show.  And for those of you whove asked (MAX AND SEAN) no we cant have it at mcdonalds.  I cant eat there cause of my diet...silly employees....  well, dont forget to sign the tag board to the side.  I know there are lots of you blog lurkers who dont want to be known...just slap up a note to say hi, but keep it clean ;-)  Hope everyone has a loverly thursday nite...im going to bed.  Nite all..  Gimme those asterisks....  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: End of my week Negative: Screw ECT 453.

      Funny tidbit from sloka today...dont worry, there will be a real post later, just had to share this...  In order to ensure the highest levels of quality work and productivity from employees, it will be our policy to keep employees well trained through our program of Special High Intensity Training (S.H.I.T.). We are trying to  give employees more S.H.I.T. than anyone else. If you feel that you do not get your share of S.H.I.T. on the job, please see your manager. You will immediately be placed at the top of the S.H.I.T.list, and our managers are especially skilled at seeing that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.  Employees who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in the Departmental Employee Evaluation Program (D.E.E.P.S.H.I.T.). Those who fail to take D.E.E.P.S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go on the Employee Attitude Training (E.A.T.S.H.I.T.). Since our managers took S.H.I.T. before they were promoted, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, and are full of S.H.I.T. already.  If you are full of S.H.I.T. you may be interested in the job of training others. We can add your name to our Basic Understanding Lecture List (B.U.L.L.S.H.I.T.). Those who are full of B.U.L.L.S.H.I.T. will get the S.H.I.T. jobs and can apply for a promotion to Director of Intensity Programs (D.I.P.S.H.I.T.).  If you have any further questions, please direct them to our Head of Training, Special High Intensity Training (H.O.T.S.H.I.T.).  Thank You, Boss in General Special High Intensity Training. (B.I.G.S.H.I.T)  See ya later tonite, bloggers..

      Not much of note for today....didnt have much happen cause i didnt do much....  I get a pretty sweet nextel phone for work soon, they decided on which ones to get today and should have ordered them today as well.  Im pretty excited, i always love new toys to play with.  It also means i get rid of this goddamn pager which has done nothing but work right.  Such a pain....i love pages that look like 419-3**-4*2**DGLJKHG;oighal;gnaweiog  Think im kidding...thats a normal one....  For some reason the tag board thing went down as of this afternoon...especially after i was pumped that i could have people leave me messages now...oh well, hopefully itll be back up soon..  I love how people talk to me in their away messages...lol, too bad they dont leave me messages or call me  ;-)  Its supposed to be in the 40's tomorrow!!  Is it bad that that gets me excited?  I may not wear a coat tomorrow just cause its going to be that balmy.  Ok, maybe not.  Maybe now my car wont sound so damn angry when i start it up early in the morning.  Wait...is that the car thats angry, or me?  I dont have much more intelligent speak to throw out today, today was kind of a waster as a day.  Not much done, not much accomplished.  Got a big exam tomorrow in my ECT 453 class....should be a real good time.  Im off to bed so i can get up to head to ITS at 8am.  See yall later, fellow blog readers...  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: Sleep Negative: Sleep Quote: I am Emmitt Smith.

      Wow...Here she is folks, blog 2.0.  After fighting with it all day, sloka won the battle on how to get the formatting close to right.  I know you have to scroll a bit to see on the side, hopefully i can get that fixed asap.  Anyone who knows HTML really well is more then welcome to help ;)  (thanks sloka, yer the bomb...good thing its your 21st tonite and im gonna get you lit....)  Morning of work meetings...8am to 1130 as usual...went better this week though.  I finally feel like im able to put out some fires rather then watching them burn around me.  I think we might be able to accomplish some things at RCC once we arent putting fires out all the time.  I like being able to do long term planning and plan implimentation when i dont have to deal with lots and lots of "piddly shit" like my boss likes to call it.    Its tuesday...so that means only one thing....kolla classes.  2 of them.  However, i did get to see dr. kolla almost electrocute himself while working with one of the electrolab motor stations.  Gotta shut off the main switch before dealing with the contacts.  Seeing blue arcs about 6 inches from your face is enough to scare the shit out of anyone, lol...Worked my ass off to get the homework that was due and then he didnt collect it.  I dont know about him sometimes...oh well...  I had something typed up yesterday about the whole anti war protests.  I know eric has talked about it in his blog, but i want to say my 2 cents.  I think everyone is entitled to their own opinion about everything, however i think that colleges are way too liberal.  First off, why do a anti war rally at a college?  who here has anything to do about it?  If you are going to rally, go to state capitals, go to washington, go somewhere where someone who can do something about it will see it.  Second...are people really that dense to think that our president is just deciding to go to war with iraq because it is fun? Oh, no they think we are going to take all the oil fields, ok...my bad.  Did anyone stop to think that the attitude they have now is the same that most of the US had before WW2?  Hitler isnt our problem, he is just some guy in a country.  So what if he kills his own people(saddam uses chemical weapons on the kurds of northern iraq)  So what if he is breaking UN laws and going against what the sanctions say?  So what if he has weapons of mass destruction that if he had the chance he would use on us or our allies?  Who cares?  Not my problem...Im by no means Pro-War...im Pro safety of the world community.  I think that something needs to be done and noone has the balls to stand up to this guy but us and britain.  So what if we have to go it alone.  Fine.  Saddam isnt a knight in shining armor.  Hes a dictator, he has ties to terrorist groups and supports them.  What happened to everyones feelings of world safety and doing whatever we had to do to stop the terrorists since 9-11?  Nothing...why?  Everyone feels secure again.  Noone worries that we could get hit again.  They take the government and what it does to protect us for granted rather then understand that there are guys out there everyday busting their balls for us to help keep america safe.  *phew*  *gets off soapbox*  Oh, and the idea of a "die-in".  I find that so repulsing i could vomit.  Im off to the bars to celebrate slokas birthday.  I think ive earned it after the weeks ive had.  Nite all...tag me in the tag box on the left side!    ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: 2 numbers.....24 Negative: HTML sucks Quote: brian + html = not bedfellows - me Song of the day: Album - Sister Hazel - Chasing Daylight(just got it in the mail today) Cool Mac Moment: Dreamweaver on my mac...oh so nice.... ************************************************************************************************************************

      REMOTE BLOGGING!!!  Yah, here i am, at home in chicago.  Its been a really nice weekend away from all the crazy crap at school.  Scholastic crap, work crap, personal crap.  Youd think i was a restroom attendant with all the crap I deal with, lol.  Sorry, attempt at humor....failed.  Friday I had a pretty good meeting in the morning, hopefully cleared alot of stuff up that weve been having problems with at RCC.  Then i had the most enjoyable day at ITS ive ever had.  I got to work on training for OS 10 for the people i work with there.  Thats right, i got paid to sit, work on a Mac, work with keynote, and write training for my favorite operating system.  Wow.  I got the cutest valentine from Candy with a Harley on it(inside ITS joke) and had some good food that the TSC staff cooked and brought in.  Ive never seen my boss eat that much either, especially since he was going to Outback that night with some friends.  Im sure hes still hurting from that, lol!  Ive been having a nice relaxing time with my mom this weekend.  Friday night i fought the snow to get home, and FINALLY was able to get home.  Had dinner - Mom made steak:) then fell asleep at 10.  Im not even making that up.  I played with my 2 cats and my sisters 2 cats that are spending a few days here since her, her husband and my dad are in florida for his schools jazz band trip.  Lots of hissing and fighting...which is what woke me up today.  RARRR!!!  REAAEERRR!!!  Yah, that was 845 this morning.  Spooks and Brisco were at it, making really nasty noises.  Had a nice breakfast with mom, dusted off my car, then headed out to good ole Cantara 30 to see Daredevil.  Decent enough flick, i just didnt dig the ending.  I wont spoil it for any of you that havent seen it yet, but its just kind of unsettling.  Got some new jeans, a new belt, went to CostCo and got some more atkins-y food and then to my personal holy mecca.  The Apple Store.  I had to talk to myself before walking in and said i was only going to get an airport card, then i was going to walk out.  I saw the same guy who i always talk to in there, and they almost talked me in to buying a base station to go with it.  My geek side was convinced, but my accounting side of my brain didnt go with it.  I talked to them about jobs, and they pretty much told me i was a dumbass for not taking the genious position out in new york.  They said to get offered a job working for apple is harder then getting into UCLA, Stanford and MIT combined.  I was totally kicking myself.  Oh well, at least i was close.  Lets hope i can get that close once i graduate.  I still only came out of the store with an airport card...and a heavy heart.  Dinner at outback..mmm...then home to do laundry and have my mom do my taxes.  Finding out im going to get a pretty phat refund is good news.  So now im sitting here with Lord of the rings on, doing laundry.  Tomorrow i gotta get up, pack and be on the road by 12 so i can be at work by 6.  Should be a real blast, im so excited.  My mom did get me the new XMen 1.5 DVD so i can check that out and play that on this lovely laptop.  Hope to post again tomorrow and give ye faithful blog readers more inane garbage to read.  Id like to get some kind of post feature or talkback forum...let me see what i can work on :)  Nite all...  ************************************************************************************************************************   Positive: Bein at home with mom :) Negative: Fighting cats!!!

      Friday...so close....i can feel it.  I know, i know, i know, i know...i didnt post yesterday.  Yesterday was too crazy for words anyways.  Came home at night, did my work, watched west wing and law and order then fell asleep.  Im getting like an old man.  But at least west wing and law and order were both very good.  Too much work, not enough time.  I know what you mean eric, i know my blog entries seem real whiny and boring, but so am i at this point.  Work is getting more and more stressfull, school is getting more and more stressfull, 3 exams in the next week.  That should be real fun.  At least tomorrow i get to spend the majorty of the day at ITS.  Maybe its because im the low man on the totem pole there, maybe its because i get to do some different things and i excel at what i do, maybe its because i actually feel appreciated, but i have to tell you guys, i love working over there.  Kirkum hooked me up to play with the new 12 inch powerbook from Apple.  What a sleek little notebook computer.  It is very light, has a nice aluminum case....sheesh.  I wish i would have waited to get my powerbook...but every computer buyer has said that before.  Well, i wont bore you with anymore bitching.  Im going to go get more work done then hit the sack.  Nite all.  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: Command and Conquer : Generals Negative: Stress Quote: "Brian and I already had our private conversation...uh, i mean..." - Rosie @ ITS Song of the day: O.A.R - Delicate Few Cool Mac Moment: Playing with the new 12" powerbook, what a sleek little thing ************************************************************************************************************************

      "Sometimes i feel like im faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggggggggggggggggggggg...fall....back....again..." - DMB  *thud*  That was the sound of my dead body hitting the desk.  These 12 hour days kill me.  8am to 8pm straight, wow.  If i could travel back in time back to my first semester as a freshman, sit myself down and tell young me what ive been through at college, i dont think young me would believe old me.  I dont even believe what ive done and gone through in my time here.  Some days it seems ive been here such a short time, other times i feel like the old man wags that people call me.  If i could take young me around with me for a day, i bet id scare young me to death.  Saying, know what young wags?  When you are a senior, are 21 and think all you are gonna do is take easy major classes and go to the bars, you will actually be working 40 hours a week, class 20, be in a fraternity and a professional organization.  You will try to excel at everything, instead pretty much fail at everything and wear yourself into a smoldering heap of human matter everyday.  After that, you will go to bed, wake up and think you can change the world.  Oh well..i guess its more or less the attitude that keeps me goin.  As you may or may not have seen, i now have redirected this page to www.brianwaggoner.com  Maybe itll get some more views...maybe not.  Dont worry, kids, the movie is still in development, just slowing down cause of how busy i am...  Cheap plug here... http://sleepingnexttowaterfalls.blogspot.com  Thats the blog for the smartest person i know, E.schrades.  Eric is not only a great co-worker and employee but also a great friend.  Hes got lots of good sense in his head and im gonna miss him once he graduates.  Head over and check out his blog....well...after reading the rest of mine...no...KEEP READING....CMON.  Well, for those of you who didnt abandon me to the man who has sweet belt buckles, what a day its been.  What a long morning of meetings.  8am - 11:30am straight.  Some meetings that went ok, some that went just god-awful-piss-poor.  But, youll have that in management.  I just feel like im treading water and im barely able to keep my head above water at RCC.  No matter how hard i work, it just seems that i got more and more things working against me.  I try to be as dedicated as i can be to a job, but man, after days like today...it sure is hard.  Oh well.  Like i said, it comes with the territory i think.  More class with kolla.  Nothing can add to frustration like class with kolla.  The guy means well, i just have a hard time understanding what he says sometimes.  Deciphering what he says and writes is just hard.  Takes a 1.5 hour lecture and draws it out.  Plus finding out that i have to get all my makeup work for my class i missed done by march first.  yes, as in alittle over 2 weeks away.  Its a good thing i found out..............TODAY.  Ugh.  Add another thing on my pile of shit i have to do that i HAVE NO FRIGGING TIME TO DO IT.  Work this afternoon went well, was very productive and i got alot done.  Its amazing what a bad mood can do to my motivation.  Sometimes it kicks me into high gear, sometimes i dont want to do anything.  This afternoon, i had some good meetings and some good brainstorming.  Plus i got to meet with the staff who will be trying out a new job, and they seem to be fairly excited about it.  Almost as excited as i am about this whole thing.  Lets hope it goes well.  Everything starts a week from today with it, i think it will definately be a new change.  Home tonite at 8, had some dinner, first real meal of the day.  New 24 tonite and damn was it good.  Now im sitting here debating if i should do any work or if i should cut my losses and go to bed.  I got toad sleeping on my chest( http://www.slooks.com/images/wags/wagsntoad.jpg ), got some DMB on....hmmm...choices choices choices.  Let me know if you are reading this and like it.  I know of a few people who read it, and its kind of theraputic for me to get it out, but i wonder if any of you are reading this and actually enjoy reading it.  IM me @ waggoner98 and let me know.  Have a good nite, blog readers, till tomorrow.... ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: 24.

      Ahhh.....Monday.  Aint no day like monday.  Except the worst day of the week.  Ehhhh, at any rate, here i am.  I had a pretty interesting day, Ill give yall the rundown of it.  Started this morning, waking up at 7, which should have been earlier so i could hit the rec before my 8am class, but whatever.  I laid in bed untill like 710 debating getting up or staying home so i could register for fall classes and get those in right at 8.  I then looked out the window to see that it was snowing like a bitch.  So what did i decide?  Those of you keeping score at home with the "Life of Brian Waggoner Game:Home Edition" can chalk up some points for me, i still trudged to that damn 8am Management 300 class.  I got there late thanks to some asshole in front of me who got in an an accident in which i had to wait to get around, but still got there in time just to have 2 minutes to do the damn pop quiz.  Then, in going over the quiz, i almost saw mike and my professor get in a boxing match, it was pretty good. (Hey mike, standard deviation = sigma ;-) )  Then off to my long day of ECT classes...  (I hauled ass to get to the tech building and register for the classes i need to graduate.  Did I get them all?  DOES A FLYING MONKEY HAVE WINGS?  In all the classes i need to graduate, just waiting on my other independant study to go through so i can get that damn instrumentation class out of the way....  First ECT 4whatever (i dont remember even the course numbers im in cause i have 5 damn ECT classes) lab.  Not too hard messing with some microprocessors and coding them to flash dirty words in the 7 segment display, hehehe.  After that and while waiting for ECT 4somethingelse to start, mike happened to roll over a floor electrical outlet and creat the biggest electrical explosion ive seein in the longest time.  Honest to god, the blue flame that shot out of the outlet had to have been around 8 inches in length.  Singed mikes leg, made a huge scorch mark on the ground and scared the shit out of both of us.  After we made sure that we didnt kill anyone or any electronics, i heard the funniest thing that has come out of my advisor/professor/ECT dept head Dr. Border ever, which is the quote of the day down below.  After another 400 level ECT class, its off to work at ITS.  Goddamn i love this job.  Name another job that will let me work with macs whenever i want and troubleshoot them.  I love working with macs so much better then PC's, its sick.  After doing some tickets and going back to my favorite area, academic enhancement(since they love me so much over there) i went back to TSC at hayes hall.  While working on some OS X training for the Tech support staff, a cute girl came in with a problem with her iBook.  Of course, they ask me to be the hero and save her data.  Not only do that, but i load os X on there for her, set it up, do software update and all other sorts of goodies for her.  I end up staying late to help her, then off to ECT 4something else to watch mike swear at another lab we have to do.  Thennnnnnnnnnn home.  So now im here, after a damn long day looking at a stack of work taller then a midget and having no drive to do it.  What killed my drive to do it tonight?  Funny you should ask...  There are days where some things happen where you say, damn..i guess i didnt expect it, but i kinda did.  Then there are days where you go...hmmm, well that makes no sense, but ok.  Then there are days where one thing happens that makes you say.... What the f&*$.  Someone, who will remain nameless IMed me out of the blue tonight.  Someone who had a huge impact on my life, and someone who has hurt me a great deal.  No matter how much time has gone by, there are still DAMN strong emotions.  Good emotions and bad emotions.  Wanting to reconcile and start talking after nearly a year of silence...wow, im not sure what to think.  The only thing i can use to explain is a song like usual.  Once upon a time I was of the mind To lay your burdon down And leave you where you stood And you believed i could Youd seen it done before I could read your thoughts Tell you what you saw And never say a word Now all that is gone Over with and done - never to return  I can tell you why People die alone I can tell you a shadow on the sun  Staring at the loss Looking for a cause And never really sure Nothing but a hole To live without a soul And nothing to be learned  I can tell you why People go insane I can show you how You could do the same I can tell you why The end will never come I can tell you Im A shadow on the sun  Shapes of every size Move behind my eyes Doors inside my head Bolted from within Every drop of flame Lights a candle in Memory of the one Who lives inside my skin  Audioslave - Shadow on the Sun  Thats all for now, blog readers.  Till tomorrow.  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: Scheduling for summer classes, getting all of them I need Negative: Ghosts from the past Quote: "I hate electricity" - Dr. Border, Head of the Electronics and Computer Technology Department Song of the day: Audioslave - Shadow on the Sun Cool Mac Moment: OS 10 installing so easily on an iBook that is 9 years older then god himself. ************************************************************************************************************************

      Howdy loyal readers...  Yah, so i know i "technically" went a day without posting...but its the weekend, so sue me.  No, dont really, i dont have the money for court costs, and knowing the lawsuits ive seen lately, it might happen.  Who knows?  Like i said in my short and sweet one last night, i had an awesome time hangin at Kamis while mike bartended.  Hes really awesome at what he does, and i know what im going to be doing now when im in town on friday nights.  Lots of pretty ladies there too.  Too bad i get real quiet when im at a bar, why?  who knows...and more importantly...who cares?  Today was kind of a bust, after getting alittle tipsy last night, i slept till about 12.  I got up and did alittle work for RCC untill sloka and i went to barnes and noble and best buy.  Got a new Bluetooth mouse for my pc that ive been wrestling to work right since i first set it up, but hopefully itll work right now.  Who knows, nothing computer related ever does work right...except for my mac.  *pause for dramatic emphasis*.  If this works as well as it should, i might get the bluetooth keyboard they have too since i think this one is about to take a dive.  Ive had this one for YEARS and its been beat to hell with all the computer garbage i do.  Who knows?  Got VERY little done for work today, way to go wags, i know...hopefully tomorrow will be a better day for that.  Went to a party at a hotel room tonight with Cari, Max, Gehlan and Elo...kind of wierd, very boring but still good to get out nonetheless.  Michelob Ultra...let me tell you about this.  Not only is this beer good because it only has 2.6 net carbs per bottle(which is good for someone on the atkins diet like myself) but it is also the best tasting beer ive ever had.  Those 2 mixed together = something very good...or very bad depending on how you look at it.  Plus, its under 5$ for a 6er.  How can you beat that?  Who knows?  I got some new CD's today too...hopefully i can listen to them tomorrow while i work.  Audioslave, Rage against the machine, the two towers soundtrack and the new santana album.  Some good stuff on there, ones ive wanted for a while, just didnt buy em cause im a weenie.  Ive had them in my amazon wish list for a while, but like ive been saying......Who knows?  Well, off to bed...got some major work to get done tomorrow.  Hope all you blog readers have a good day as well, and ill be back to post tomorrow...but then again....who knows?  ************************************************************  Positive: Better bluetooth acceptance from technology companies Negative: Microsoft making something really easy....fiendishly difficult....

      Well well well....bloggin away as per usual....  Well...another exciting day.  Thursdays are always bundles of fun with 2 classes with Dr. Kolla.  Those of you non-ECT folks just dont understand how much fun that is;)  I got to see Mike get pretty whacky today, which is something new.  Note to self...before i leave BG, I have to spend time with mike when hes hammered, if hes anywhere close to what he was like today all slaphappy, it will be definately a sight to be seen...  I like the new niche im fitting into at ITS.  Nothing like only having to work on Macs all day and being the hero for people who have problems with theirs.  Something about the difference between Mac users and PC users.  Im not saying all PC users suck, im just saying that a majority of mac users are alot more pleasant and are willing to work through problems rather then scream and shout and demand you do everything they want.  Besides the fact that Apple hardware and software are less prone to problems, its just a joy to work on that stuff.  I actually hope to find problems i dont know answers to so i learn more.  As geeky as that sounds, i love having a passion.  Which brings me to a new ramble point.  I gotta tell ye blog readers, something that bugs the hell out of me is people with no drive.  People who are too wrapped up in themselves and have no ambition or fire about anything.  I dont care if your drive is basketweaving, but people who just sit around, dont do anything, dont work hard, just BS around, act like they know stuff when they dont...man, just gets under my skin.  I am meeting more and more people like that, and when i see them get chances and succeeding while riding coattails or bullshitting, it makes me really evaluate myself and how i try to be true to myself and others, and how far thats gotten me.  Ugh.  Computer job fair tonight.  Those of you who were there to hire full time employees please raise your hands?    *chirp*   *chirp chirp*   Yah.  Thats what i thought.  Thanks, nice to know the economy is strong, jobs are plentiful and IT is thriving.  Wow, sarcasm.  Tomorrow is going to be a big day for RCC.  Im actually pretty excited.  Those of you who arent AC's will find out soon what im talking about.  Hopefully you will be as excited as i am about this whole thing.  Its going to definately revolutionize how RCC works not only this year but next year.  Random side note....how is it someone can come rolling in and out of your life, totally change how you feel, how you operate, how you see the future, but then can roll out just as fast.  There is someone who is like that in my life, and its so hard to see it happen, but its so good when they are around.  Ugh.  After so many failed relationships, its so nice to see someone that sparks me like that, but so hard that its like a magnet.  Get so close, then suddenly for no reason it pushes away so hard.  Too bad all you have to do is flip one magnet around to make them come together.  To bad i dont know which magnet to turn around.  Oh well, enough inane babbling from me for one night.  Off to prep for my senior staff meeting tomorrow morning at 8am.  Have a good day yall, and ill see you tomorrow night.  ************************************************************  Positive: Seeing her again...

      Day 2 of the blog...lets see how long i can keep this daily entry stuff up, eh?  Ive heard from a few people that they are reading this and dig it...so it shall continue...  What a long day AGAIN, but its worth it, i guess. Lots of classes and work today, and some shitty situations at work.  I wish everything could work out for the best, but i guess thats why they have managers.  Someone has to deal with the hard and shitty situations.  Although, there is some really cool stuff happening at work that im really proud to be a part of.  Im actually updating this today when i should be working on a presentation for my friday staff meeting on the new changes, but i digress.  Making some new friends lately that i would have never expected to be as cool as they are.  Some people ive known for a while, some brand new.  Makes knowing that im going to leave here in a few months all the harder.  Then again, i feel like some friends are slipping away.  Im not one to talk about this stuff, but ive realized how you may not really know people.  Ive had alot of time to myself to think about this, especially after my last relationship battle...i guess im learning how people can really touch you, but can also really hurt you.  It sucks that there is someone out there that you really care about...you think they know..but may not feel the same way, or care that you do.  Worked with my advisor/department head/professor for 3 of my 6 classes.  Im about 3 hurdles from the only thing holding me back from graduating in august is my own academic performance.  I cant even begin to tell you how exciting this is for me.  Its not that i want to leave bowling green, who knows, if ITS offers me a job i may not(wink wink, you out there Chad?) i may still be around working full time.  I just am getting so tired of school, school work, school bullshit, you all know the drill.  I have no drive to do homework or any work outside of going to class.  Sure, maybe the 20 hours are getting to me on top of the 40 hours of work, but still....more and more tedious bullshit.  Eh, too much whining on wag's part.  In super awesome news, sloka and i are going to see "An Acoustic Evening with Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds" in march.  We are both so stoked to go.  This being my 10th DMB related concert ever, im sure its going to be incredible...yah sloka...chicken?  Im adding a new part to my closing section, called Cool Mac Moment.

      Well, here it is.  In talking to good ole Eric Shraedes today, he convinced me to start one of these wild weblogs.  My main concern is...who would want to read this crap, but i guess im going to have to hear from you all as to if you like reading about it or not.  Another long day today, for those of you following Wag's schedule.  Meetings from 8am to 1130am, class from 1130-4pm, more work and meetings from 4-6pm, then ISA chapter(finally a frigging night when i can attend) from 6-8.  I know i know...i am subjecting myself to all of this work and school, but i figure if i bust my ass now...it SHOULD pay off in the long run.  Long run which graced my presence in the form of a phone call yesterday...  For those of you that DONT know...im a total computer geek.  However i'm a group of elite computer geeks, AKA Mac evangelists.  Not mac users, mind you, but evangelists.  Someone who makes his Mac a part of his life.  Needless to say, working for apple would be and is my dream job.  I dont care what i do for them, i could be cleaning latrines in their uber secret underground laboratory(i know there is one...i know it, dammit) and i would be content.  Needless to say, something big happened.  Finding out i will in fact graduate this august spurred me on a major application of job frenzy this weekend and i applied for 22, yes 22 jobs with apple on jobs.apple.com.  Jobs i feel i am qualified for and would excel at.  Namely system admin, tech jobs, mac genious(not as concieded as youd think).  Well...the gods of careers smiled on me, and a recruiter called to interview me yesterday.  I went through 2 batterys of personality interviews.  The first one was kind of a walkthrough of my resume, then more of a situational customer service interview.  After that i had an hour of technical testing.  One hour of the most difficult computer questions ive ever been asked.  Out of 150 of them, i got only 10 wrong.  Go wags, i know.  So after that, she offered to fly me out to New York(long island to be exact) to interview in person.  It was at that point when i turned down my dream job.  Thats right sports fans, i turned it down.  The thing was yah, its everything i want to do with my life, yah its a job starting at 45k a year...but they wanted me to start right away.  As in bail out of school, dont graduate and go work for apple.  Thinking in the long run, i decided that wouldnt be the best decision.  That was easily the hardest thing ive ever had to do.  Turn down the job ive wanted ever since i was a kid.  Well, heres to graduating and having more oppertunities at apple computer, i know ill make it there...i have to make it there.

      Well kids....its been a while.  But a fitting weekend to a very strange week.  I havent posted much about the recent situations ive been going through.  Id say the situations with katie, but thats nowhere even close.  Its more the situations with everyone else.  I dont know why, it just seems that everyone feels they have some stake in this and wants to voice that opinion.  Thats fine, but....meh.  I dont know, its a fine line between opinion and acting like they know how to run my or katies life better then we do.  Anyways, i digress...  Friday.  Slow day at work, but the weather was goddamn beautiful.  The whole day it was like 70 and sunny.  My sister was coming up to visit with the grandparents, so max, cari and i went out to bw3 with them and had a good time.  Of course, then it turned 40 and rainy.  Id LOVE to have a talk with whoever is in charge of the weather around here.  Anyways, it was really nice to see my sister and her husband, take them out for a bit and talk to them about whats going on in their lives.  It sucks that i live so far from my family sometimes, sometimes its DEFINATELY a bonus.  Went home after that, watched terminator 2 with max and cari(even though cari hated it with a passion) and just kind of paced around the apartment.  Friday was the Phi Mu Alpha formal, and i could have gone, but a. had no date, b. had to be on call for work and c. my sister was coming into town.  So, katie went with  urlLink Sloka   and had a good time.  I got to see her in her dress, she stopped by after the formal just so i could see.  :)  After that, we talked for a long time.  Its just nice to talk to her.  Saturday i slept in like its my job, then got up, did the normal wags thing, hung out with katie for a bit in the afternoon, then got another call from someone extremely suprising....mandy.  Went to dinner with her, had another heart to heart, talked about katie, who strangely enough is mandy's little in SAI, and generally had some good discussion.  Sloka told me some people were coming over to hang/drink at CH 45, so mandy and i trucked over there.  Had a good time, went to meijer for some crazy sloka and wags fun, made some drinks(WHO DRINKS WHITE RUSSIANS?) and headed down to kristin mcdonalds apartment for her party.  Major fun ensued....                              So, yeah.  Good times were had by all.  Got to see katie again last night and talk to her some more.  Sounds like she had a good time.  So, in other words, it looks like things are really going strongly well for me in every area for the first time in about 2 years.  Things are so different for me in so many areas, its hard to describe.  Ive hit some pretty important times lately, and some pretty important decisions.  Not blaming people for things we did as children, acting more like an adult in every aspect, just other things.  Ive spent so much time stuck on problems from 2 years ago that i dont focus on the good things of today.  Sure its not really that easy, but life goes on.  Things change.  Take what you can now, grasp it whole heartedly...it does you no good to think of what was.  Thats my pithy statement of the day.  Im gonna go shower, hit the grocery store so i dont have to eat bobbins.  Have a good sunday, yall.  *****************************************  Positive: What a weekend.

      hey everyone, just got my work done, and i got some time to kill...so i think ill post here to yall.  Its been a good past couple of days.  Katie and I are dating, and this is a very good thing.  There has been alot of drama about it, although all the drama is with others.  Through all of it, its just made us closer, id venture to say.  I could go on and on and on about it, but it can be summed up in 3 words.  Wags is happy.   Ill leave that whole thing at that.  Everything else has been going well lately.  I dont know if its because ive been so happy about that, or if ive just got a new attitude on everything, but im dealing with all the stress out there alot better.  Class is getting pretty stressful, work is going crazy and so are family things.  Im just glad i have something keeping me going through all of this craziness.  I added a link for my schedule that i can post and publish through iCal.  Pretty damn slick if you ask me.  Check it out...in case you wanna know where wags is at any random moment of the day.  Got a nice relaxing weekend coming up....if by relaxing i mean, lots of work, studying for 2 exams, doing tons of homework.  I WILL spend time with katie though, dammit.  :-D  Hope all is well with you all out there in blogger world.  Leave some love on the chatterbox.  *****************************************  Positive: Katie :-)  Negative: Being so damn tired Quote: "We have plenty of time" Song of the day: Stay or Leave - Dave Matthews Cool Mac Moment: Publishing my calendar through .mac and iCal.

      Well hello everyone....  Hope you all like the new changes to my blog.  Ive added a few more links on the side, changed some formatting, etc.  Trying out some new stuff.  One of the links i added was for http://dear_raed.blogspot.com, check that out, its pretty creepy.  A person living in baghdad who is showing the accounts of the war.  Wow.  Had some long ass meetings this morning, ended up finding out some might be cancelled and combined.  Wow would that make my day if i could do that.  The shear idea that i could sleep in one morning.  Wowza.  I got a call walking over to our meeting from katie.  :-)  She asked me when we had dinner last night...i was kinda confused untill she said she needed to know because she couldnt eat for a certain amount of hours cause she found out she had to have blood work done.  Hmmm...blood work.  It sure was good to hear from her, though.  Headed over to ECT stuff with dr. kolla.  Ended up rob got our lab done before i even got there, so i didnt have anything to do untill lab started, which kolla told us "lets get this thing over with".  I just kind of laughed and rolled my eyes.  Thats a great way to spark students to learn.  Oh well.  I spent the time inbetween ECT classes to work on the updates for the site, then got a call from katie again.  She had to get her blood work done then, so i told her id drive her to wood county.  They botched up my blood work something fierce so i wanted to make sure she was ok and didnt have to drive back all woozy.  Took her over, got it done pretty quick, got her back all safe and sound.  Didnt go to my 2nd ECT class, overla took notes for me, thank god.  Headed to the gas station to get gas since katie told me i was "playing the gas game" then got a new chicken ceaser salad from mcdonalds and headed to work for a few hours.  Hmmm....tonight.  Yeah.  More on that on a later date.  Off to bed everyone.  Hope all of you are having as good of a week as i am.  Things are just great for me lately.  Better mood, better outlook, better feelings on life, just better in general.  I know it could just be temporary....but damn, wags is in a great mood.  Night all...and sweet dreams.  *****************************************  Positive: Spending time with Katie Negative: Secrets Quote: Too many from max, katie, wags and cari tonite, we were on a roll   Song of the day: One Love - Sister Hazel Cool Mac Moment: I love my mac at work.

I definately had some lady call me on the on call phone for RCC to report a problem when i wasnt on call, then got PISSED that i told her that i was going to transfer her issue to someone who could deal with it faster so she hung up on me.  Tonight.  What a night, thats all im gonna say about that.  Have a good night and tomorrow, bloggers.  Remember, its monday, so its a new sbemail @ homestarrunner.com.

      *************BLOG - WEEKEND EDITION*************  WHAT A WEEKEND.  Ive had some SERIOUSLY interesting things happen to me over the weekend.  Wow.  Friday was fun.  Meetings in the morning, then just as i was getting ready to head over to ITS, i got a call on my cell.  Some contracting company was looking for help getting some networking and IT stuff set up in the House of Reps in findlay and found my resume on careerbuilder.com.  Wanted me to go down for about 5 hours, pay me about 20$ an hour.  I almost did it, since id get paid about 3 times as much as working at ITS for that time, but i did the responsible thing and said thanks but i couldnt.  The guy asked me if i knew anyone else who would like to do it, so i gave the phone to max, he got all the information, was ready to go.  I headed off to ITS.  Max calls me, tells me they dont have the hardware, so it didnt even matter.  Oh well, i guess its good that people are seeing my resume and that i may be attractive to employers.  Oh well.  Had a good day at ITS, solved some MAJOR tickets that ive had in my work for a long time.  BIG ones.  I felt like the hero.  Worked on training, got pretty close to getting it done.  was good to work with jessie, she always makes me smile.  Got her to agree to come out to kamis with mccomas and i that night, i didnt think she would...but OH BOY would i be wrong.  Went home, had something to eat...then 10pm rolled around, and you know what time it was....Got to kamis, talked to overla and webb for a bit, got some wierd info on this cabbage soup diet from webb, who knows.  He says it works, but it sure sounds wierd.  Jen and Scott showed up at the same time as mccomas and his ladyfriend carissa.  Had some fun with them, more and more people showed up, talked to them....but no jessie.  I started to get tired around 1230, it had been a long day, so i decided to bail.  Took jen and scott home and got home and then went back to my apartment.  Was home for 5 minutes, talked to max, then my cell rang.  Guess who finally came to kamis.  So she told me she wanted me to head out there, so i did.  Got there, ended up going wild, drinking more then i should have, dancing with jessie(and we all know how much wags dances) and having a great time with her.  Last call came, she said she didnt want to go home, so i said ok, and we all decided to go to mccomas's place.  Jess, me, mccomas, carissa, and 3 of jess's friends.  Got a 12 pack of longnecks to go and hopped in my car.  We got to mccomas's place, sat down, everyone did their bathroom run and jessie started having breathing problems.  Apparently shes pretty allergic to cats and her throat started to close off.  She started to have problems and start to have an anxiety attack.  I spent about an hour with her, outside in my car where it was warm but no cats to help her calm down, try to breathe and get back to normal again.  Noithing was really helping, so i ran her back to her dorm, got her in there after almost attacking the night guard and got her her medication, calmed down and finally to sleep.  She finally went to sleep around 4, i stayed with her till 7 to make sure she was ok, and then i went home.  Got to sleep at 7, woke up at one.  There is ALOT that happened that afternoon in talking to someone, but my filter has to kick in.  All i can say is im waiting and seeing and hoping for good things to happen.  Heres to that.  Stayed up till the weeeeeeeeee hours of the morning so that i could go see katie and red at dance marathon, had a great time with them and listened to katie say "i dont know" 129345095 times that night ;)  Came home, and couldnt sleep at 3ish am, stayed up talking online then finally went to bed around 4.  Today, nothing big.  Slept in, watched more news, did some work, etc..Meeting tonite, now im just waiting for someone to get home...  So...the war.  Shock and awe hit on friday, and what a scene it was.  It was pretty intense to watch baghdad get the SNOT kicked out of it.  Scary, pretty scary.  Its a shame it had to come to this, but seeing whats happened in the past few days is nuts.  Hearing reports that Iraqis have captured and executed some of our guys and that weve found a chemical weapons plant.  This is just insane.  Its totally surreal, it just messes with my head something fierce.  I shouldnt watch the news anymore, its jut not good for me.  Well, thats all for the weekend edition, thanks for those of you who read through all of this, it means alot to me.  *****************************************  Positive: *filter* Negative: War....POW's....yuck Quote: "I dont know" - Katie Song of the day: Best Ill Ever Be - Sister Hazel Cool Mac Moment: Rendevous is THE SHIT. *****************************************

      Operation Iraqi Freedom: Day 2  What a day.  I worked this morning trying to find a TV to keep on top of what is going on in the war.  I feel like most people dont care.  Im the one who says...hey, the ground war has started, or hey, artillery has started to fire....and everyone i talk to in the majority is like....yeah?  Even if you oppose the war, how can you be apathetic like this?  Ugh.  Class today...its a thursday, to its kolla day.  F that noize.  Glad its over, thats for sure.  For the record...talking to katie is awesome :)  So im sitting here now, watching the live feed of our troops moving into Iraq.  This is kinda creepy, but pretty interesting to see it as it happens.  I dont know if its necissarily the best way to do it, but im still watching.  Scud missile strikes today, scuds that saddam didnt have.  Also lighting oil rigs on fire....even though the UN ambassador for iraq said they wouldnt do that.  What else are we going to find?  I feel bad for the people in Kuwait City who have had 7 air raid drills today, 4 of them legit.  Thank god for Patriot Missile Batteries.  I love the American Military.    Phrase Wags is officially sick of? "Shock and Awe"  Its up there with dented chads.  Anyone see that they found ricin, a bio-agent in paris?  How creepy is that....  Work tomorrow, even though id like to stay home and watch the news all day.  Yah right wags....like that would happen.  I was up till 2 watching the news, and i think im worrying about this all so much.  Meh.  Good thing the Dave and Tim tour started up.  Sets are looking pretty damn good...  Off to bed now, wish i could have gone to pollyeyes tonite.  :(  *****************************************  Positive: 70 degrees again today?

      War.    Spent the night watching TV with katie.    Pray for america.  Pray for the world.  Pray for everything.  *****************************************  Positive: Watching the news with katie Negative: War has begun. Quote:    My fellow citizens, at this hour American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger.    On my orders, coalition forces have begun striking selected targets of military importance to undermine Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s ability to wage war. These are opening stages of what will be a broad and concerted campaign.    More than 35 countries are giving crucial support, from the use of naval and air bases, to help with intelligence and logistics, to the deployment of combat units. Every nation in this coalition has chosen to bear the duty and share the honor of serving in our common defense.    To all of the men and women of the United States armed forces now in the Middle East, the peace of a troubled world and the hopes of an oppressed people now depend on you.    That trust is well placed.    The enemies you confront will come to know your skill and bravery. The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.    In this conflict, America faces an enemy who has no regard for conventions of war or rules of morality. Saddam Hussein has placed Iraqi troops and equipment in civilian areas, attempting to use innocent men, women and children as shields for his own military — a final atrocity against his people.    I want Americans and all the world to know that coalition forces will make every effort to spare innocent civilians from harm. A campaign on the harsh terrain of a nation as large as California could be longer and more difficult than some predict. And helping Iraqis achieve a united, stable and free country will require our sustained commitment.    We come to Iraq with respect for its citizens, for their great civilization and for the religious faiths they practice. We have no ambition in Iraq, except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people.    I know that the families of our military are praying that all those who serve will return safely and soon.    Millions of Americans are praying with you for the safety of your loved ones and for the protection of the innocent.    For your sacrifice, you have the gratitude and respect of the American people and you can know that our forces will be coming home as soon as their work is done.    Our nation enters this conflict reluctantly, yet our purpose is sure. The people of the United States and our friends and allies will not live at the mercy of an outlaw regime that threatens the peace with weapons of mass murder.    We will meet that threat now with our Army, Air Force, Navy, Coast Guard and Marines, so that we do not have to meet it later with armies of firefighters and police and doctors on the streets of our cities.    Now that conflict has come, the only way to limit its duration is to apply decisive force. And I assure you, this will not be a campaign of half measures and we will accept no outcome but victory.    My fellow citizens, the dangers to our country and the world will be overcome. We will pass through this time of peril and carry on the work of peace. We will defend our freedom. We will bring freedom to others. And we will prevail.          May God bless our country and all who defend her.      Song of the day: God Bless America *****************************************

He?s trying to figure out whether he's Irish or Jewish.?    ?I think the doubters and the detractors in this country and around the world are going to be dazed and stunned.  I think they're going to be overwhelmed at how proficient our troops are, how quickly they act, and how soon it's over.?       ?Those who have stood in solidarity with Hussein are going to be so profoundly embarrassed, that many of us are going to stand up and cheer at their humiliation.  I know I'm going to want to.?     ?Liberalism is close to socialism, which exists in the world of Utopia.  They have all these fantastic dreams of perfection, they have these dreams of idealism - and, of course, that's all they are because perfection and idealism are practically impossible since human beings are flawed.?    ?The left's kooks are becoming the left's mainstream.  They are so devoid of reality that they simply refuse to see it, and instead will believe fantasy.  They live in a dream world.?     ?I sometimes wonder if these people standing in front of bulldozers do not think they?re real.  They place themselves in harm's way as human shields and actually believe that their presence will stop the course of history.?     ?There is abject hatred for George Bush.  This anti-Americanism that we see in this country and around the world is not really anti-Americanism; it's anti-Bushism.  They hate Bush and conservatism just like they hated Reagan.?    ?The hatred for Bush amongst Democrats in this country and liberals around the world is so real that, if given the chance, it would manifest itself in the ultimate harm to this country.?

      Hey all...  Know its been a while since ive posted....i havent been in much of a blogging mood.  Meh.  Tonite i watched the presidents speech.  Wow.  This whole war thing is going to happen.  Pretty damn creepy.  Whats creepiest is that its been reported that saddam is giving out chem and bio weapons to his front line troops in Iraq.  Ick.  This is getting bad, folks.  Bad.  Long day of class today...and work.  Tomorrow is going to be a long day too, so im gonna get some sleep and try to keep this war off my mind.  Talk to you tomorrow.   *****************************************  Positive: Nice weather Negative: War....i know its needed but still scary.

       “There's a way for Bush to get everything he wants, and you know what it is?  The word begins with a ‘V’ and ends with a ‘Y.’  It’s called VICTORY.”   “Make no mistake about it: we are an impediment to world socialism.  That's why Clinton and Carter are more popular outside the United States than they are here.”   “I've changed my mind on this boycott stuff.  To hell with the Dixie Chicks and all these people.  Just boycott them.”   “There's a little part of me asking if this whole thing has been a bluff and we never intended to pull the trigger.  Was the whole purpose of mounting this massive force to make Hussein realize he can't win and take exile?"   “We're trying to 'connect the dots,' and the same Doubting Thomases who would have prevented us from doing so before 9/11 are standing in the way of it happening now.”   “Inspector Clouseau-Blix is more worried about global warming than any major military conflict.  If that doesn't tell you what's really going on, I don't know what does.  This guy is a glittering jewel of colossal ignorance.”   “We have natural yearnings as free people.  We've been turned loose since the founding of this country and the fact that it is the lone superpower of the world is no accident. It's not an accident of birth; it's not an accident of geography; it's not an accident of anything.  It's the result of just pure, simple freedom combined with hard work.”   “We're being told that the Iraq threat is imminent, and yet it's taking months to deploy, and people are frustrated at the U.S. being kicked around at the U.N., when that was totally avoidable.  If we're going to go to the U.N., let's kick some people around instead of being the kickees.”   “If you’re hearing that we’re going to be violating international law, nothing could be more convoluted.  International law means nothing right now.  Resolution 1441 means nothing.  Nothing the U.N. does means anything.  Which is why so many of us continue to be frustrated that we keep going back to it.”   “A conservative could easily win the Nobel piece prize if he were to rip President Bush and the United States.  That has become the criteria.”

      Hey all....going to bed pretty soon...thought i would blog for a bit...  Spent the morning @ ITS, nothing exciting even though i did finish a ticket ive been working on for weeks.  Nothing to write home about, but at least i got to reimage machines while listening to my i-a-ma-pod.  Spent 5 hours on tha road this afternoon to get home here to chicago. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THIS WEATHER.  Bowling Green = 20 degrees.  Chicago = 57 degrees.  I drove the last leg of my trip with my windows down. Listened to chicago talk radio the whole way home...yes, you can get WLS almost in ohio.  Pretty awesome.  Listened to Rush this afternoon and heard ALOT of good info.  Heres alittle gem for you all to think about.  In the almost 50 years since the inception of the UN, there have been over 100 wars that have broken out in one way or another.  Only 2 of them have been sanctioned by the UN security council.  Which 2?  The korean conflict....and the persian gulf war.  Both of which have not been solved and we are dealing with now.  How does this make any sense?  Even you ultra liberals out there should read newsmax.com...i linked it in the bar up at the top.  Check it out, it has some EXTREMELY good information.    Chicago has a new starting quarterback.  Kordell Stewart.  All of the kordell naysayers out there need to zip it.  Some QBs have good years some have bad.  Its not a matter of talent, its a matter of team chemistry, coaching and guidance.  Im reserving judgement untill i see him play, but the truth of the matter is that the bears need a quality QB.  Will kordell do it?  Hopefully, but well see...  Im going to watch the chicago news to see what they say about kordell then im going to hit the hay.  I get to sleep in tomorrow...in my own bed....with my cats.....in the best town in the world.  I cant tell you how much i love chicago.  Damn.  Nite all... *****************************************  Positive: Home in Chicago, Kordell is QB, GREAT WEATHER, so much good today Negative: I have to leave this town on sunday...

Max and I did start on a day in tha life of Mr. Saws.  heh...Had an ice storm last nite, and it took me 30 minutes to chip my car out of it so i could just drive to work this morning...wooo.  Got the game freelancer today....pretty sweet.  I can see this stealing my time...  Still got the major thing from yesterday on my mind...meh.  Thats all i can say.  That and i can cross some other ideas off my list in the dating category.  Oh well, i can deal with being single.   Thats all i got.  Maybe something interesting will happen this weekend.  Then again, prolly not.  At least i get to leave to go home at noon...that and ill have a pretty easy morning @ ITS.  Nite all.   *****************************************  Positive: Slow day Negative: The inch of ice that covered everything today...

      What a day, blog fans...what a day.  First off, weather?  MAKE UP YOUR MIND.  it was almost 50 today, then 30 then almost 50 then 30.  Rain, sun rain sun rain....make up yer MIND!  Meh, i think ill get over it eventually.  Work today was....work.  ITS, im taking this listproc problem on head on.  There is an EDHD listproc that has over 4800 subscribers to it, and someone got klez on it.  For those of you that dont know what klez is, its a real nasty self propogating virus, and it does it through email.  So, as you could imagine, its now infected tons of people and is propogating over this listproc.  600 bounced filtered emails a day.  Yah, thats a shload.  The owner was told by the person who adminitsters all listprocs that she has to "deal with it"  I dont buy that, and im going to fix this goshdarn it....if its the last thing i do.  RCC.  Got all of our shit done today...so i get to take friday off!  WOO!!  Getting to go home early is always good :)  Oh yes, the music lab in the kreischer batchelder lab(there ya go di) is now up and ready to go.  All we need are signs and a computer image(i.e. software package for those of you non techies out there)  Desks are together, machines set up, keyboards, headphones, etc are all connected and secured. Im looking at this lab to be one of the things as my legacy.  Ive worked on this thing for over a year and a half...and its really cool to see it come to be.  *sigh*  Speaking of things from a year and a half.....what a strange night it was for me.    I talked for 4 hours with someone from my past...pretty much the most important someone from my past.  Its amazing how you take so long to get over someone, and then it takes so little time for all those feelings and memories to come back and slap you in the face again.  The talk was good and bad.  good in the fact there was some "closure" i guess, but bad in the fact that everything i thought came true.  How you hope the other person in the relationship who hurts you feels remorse, wishes they did something different, wishes they could have another crack at it to see what would work if you would have known about these things beforehand or would have acted like an adult.  Thats harder for me to hear then hearing "im happy without you brian, i did what i did because we werent working".  Love is a difficult thing.  Its very very hard for me to work on these things after whats happened.  Like we said, the good things were VERY good, but the bads were also very bad.  Bad feelings go away over time, but the good ones linger.  When you talk about a relationship almost 2 years later, its easy to overlook the pain and suffering, but its easy to say, hey wasnt it nice when we were in love?  Wasnt it nice to feel secure with each other?  Wasnt it nice to know i have you and you have me and nothing will ever tear that apart?  Its a strange situation when it is torn apart.  When its gone, when life gets thrown around and when someone gets hurt.  I miss that security, i miss that love.  I miss feeling like noone could hurt me, because i have someone who will love me.  Sure, since then, ive become more independant, almost too much, but i feel empty.  Im quick to kill potential relationships because i dont feel how i felt with the one.  Will i ever find another one where i match like that or better?  Sure im young...but im doubtful.  Im a tough guy, and besides episodes of babylon 5, 24 and that part of armageddon where bruce willis kicks afflecks ass back in the elevator so hes the one to die, i rarely get choked up.  Right now is one of those times.  This is pretty hard for me to deal with.  Wow.  Yah, so i got a chatterbox now.  I know its in an annoying place, but if anyone wants to help me put it on the side, im more then willing to take the help...cause i suck at HTML.      My vid card came for my mac today, so now all i need is my Monitor and keyboard and ill be sitting pretty.  Monitor is coming back from KDS in an RMA, and my keyboard is on its wayyyy...wooooo  Well, im off to bed....gotta breathe through the *arrrrnge*(as brad would say) spray that we need to use to kill the cats litterbox stink.  Nite all...leave me some love on AIM or the chatterbox, i could really use it after tonite.   *****************************************  Positive: Talking to Mandy Negative: Talking to Mandy  Quote: "Well, a bent carboard tube is beter then a screwdriver in vance's neck....wait, no its not" - Fertel  Song of the day: All You Wanted - Michelle Branch Cool Mac Moment: Shes SO CLOSE to being a full system!!

      Hey blog readers!  Long day, but not a bad day.  Spent the morning working at ITS, fixed some problems and im trying to tackle a pretty big problem with a listproc.  Definately going to be a good learning experience.  This afternoon i worked on getting the music lab set up.  We built 5 desks in 4 hours.  Tomorrow it will be time to get the computers set up, get the keyboards in place and connected and start to work on signs, cleaning and documentation.  This musc lab has been my baby for years.  Its nice to finally see it come to fruition.  Once its open and ready for use, ill be happy.  Especially if it gets the use im predicting it will.  Anyone see the news report about the new bomb, called the MOAB?  Its the biggest conventional weapon the military has.  Pretty scary stuff, but makes me feel better that while its horrible we need them, that we will be able to do what needs to be done.  Scary.  Im blogging on my mac now....yay!  Im having a really nice political discussion with Katie right now...i swear she is one of the coolest people i know.  :)  Back to work tomorrow...woooooo....should be fun :)  Talk to you all tomorrow!  *****************************************  Positive: Music lab is coming along...AND katie got a new puppy!!!!

Drove the 5 hours from chicago straight to work at RCC.  Talk about welcome back.  Got some stuff done though, so that was good.  Im watching ben harper on tv right now too...soooo, thats fun :)  Tomorrow im off to work at ITS from 9-12.  Then RCC from 12-evening sometime.  I know the tagboard is down, it pretty much aced the whole blog for some reason.  Ill work on getting it back, dont you kidz worry.  Have a nice nite, and ill see you all tomorrow!  ***************************************** Positive: G4 is up and running... Negative: working during spring break...

      Well, its been a while since ive blogged....ive been at home doing home things, relaxing a bit and trying to get away from all the hustle and bustle of school.  It doesnt really feel like its spring break time, let alone spring since its like -3243214 degrees and snowy.  F that noize.  Had a decent friday.  Worked a long day then drove the 5 hours home to chicago.  Spent saturday with my sister, driving around trying to find a replacement vid card for my mac and only had people trying to sell me 400$ geforce or radeon cards.  Too bad i spent less on the system then i would on one of those damn cards.  So i went back to her place, got on ebay, and got one for 10.50.  Yah....ten bucks.  Go ebay.  Also got my hair cut....its about time since i was getting close to mountain main status.  Now im all chic and sexy and im sure ill attract ALL the women when i get back.  If by all the women i mean repel all of them.  Watching some TV today(wow the arena football league is wierd) and doing some laundry.  I get to go to outback for dinner tonite, then head back to BG tomorrow morning.  I got my new nextel phone at RCC.  Pretty neat toy.  Will be interesting to get all the documentation in place to get the new on call system finally in place.  I took the time this morning to watch all the "meet the press" shows and see what colin powell and condi rice had to say.  Im not a big fan of going to war, cause i think its going to incite more terror attacks on the US, but i think it is the right thing to do now.  I trust the president and his administration to do what is right.  I dont think they would put all of our military on the line just cause of some hunch.  I wont get on my soapbox again, if you want to see it, check the archives of mine to see my views on the war.  SLOKA GOT A BLOG!!!!!  Check my links on the right and read his shizzy.  FINALLY SLOBOB!  Oh, and red...its only a matter of time before you fall to the blog epidemic....  Thats all for now, kids...Ill hopefully be back to blogging again tomorrow!  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: 10$ video card...wooooo!

      Hey all....  I think i should start blogging earlier.  By the time i get here, im tired and cranky and probably piss some people off.  Oh well....i think some people still listen   Work this morning, blah blah.  Nothing too huge there.  More class this afternoon.  ECT 453 lab just dragged on and on and on.  I dont know why Kolla has to make this stuff so goddamn hard, but i guess thats his perogative.  Overla was getting worked up, so was i, so was phil and so was franklin.  I just wanted to get home, since i knew my mac was sitting here waiting to be put together.  Speaking of which, i got home, and started throwing parts together...too bad one of the most important part, the video card doesnt work.  Ends up i dont have an AGP pro card.  Blah.  Now i need to find a card somewhere before i can start tinkering with it.  I found one online, but im gonna check when i get home, that way i can come home on monday, mess with it and get it set up finally.  Should be fun.  Im more or less too tired to do it now and do it well.  In bears news...i sure hope they sign kordell stewart. Everyone bitches about how inconsistant he is, how blah blah he is.  All im saying is Jim Miller.  A chimp with a decent arm would be better, let alone kordell stewart.  Think about this.  Stewart and chandler taking a good draft pick QB under their wing for a year...*cough*byron leftwich*cough* and then having a new tom brady or chad pennington.  Just a thought.  Man, the lions next year?  They are gonna be TIIIIIIGHT.  Mariuchi?  Dre Bly?  Looking at signing rosie colvin?  Damn.  Itll be interesting to see what happens there.  F THE STEELERS AND NOT RESIGNING WAYNE GANDY.  I love you guys...but jesus...CMON.  Did interviews for the open Area Coordinator position for next semester.  Went alot better and differently then i thought.  It will be interesting to see what comes from that.  Some dumbass stole all the internal components of worth out of a PC in the GPR in offenhauer.  This is going to make the meeting tomorrow pretty fun.  That, deciding on a new AC and taking about AC accountability....its gonna be super fun.  Watched Bush's press conference tonight.  Yes, im a big supporter of his administration, and i think he did a good job explaining his point.  Hes no war monger and tonite showed that, i just dont know why he keeps repeating things over and over that we know.  If he doesnt want to say something, say...i dont want to comment.  Otherwise, its just redundant.  Oh, and by the way, anyone who says no blood for oil is the most ignorant person i know.  Not cause they are anti-war, but because they dont pay attention to any reasons why the ADMINISTRATION, not just the president are looking at this.  This is an issue of WORLDWIDE significance, not the fact that he wants to strengthen oil ties.  Noone says that about spain or britain, jesus.  Sometimes i cant stand a liberal perspective on that.  No, scratch that, i cant stand a stance that doesnt have the facts straight.  I agree with many liberal points, but not ignorant points.  Im tired and cranky, and franky pretty damn scared of this war.  Im going home to chicago tomorrow night, so prolly no blog entry.  Ill let you know what im up to sometime.  Have a good friday, yall.  ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: G4 is here!

I went and got some extra ram, formatted my 120 gb drive to put in it, pulled out my 2nd cd rom, found my extra vid card....its all in a pile, waiting for the sawtooth to come to meeee.....  I cant wait!  Going home friday after work at ITS.  Should be nice to go home and relax, spend some time with my sister and other fun stuff.  Cant wait to have some time away from bg, even if it is only fro friday-monday.  Talked to Red, sloka and fink, and im getting hella excited planning a summer full of DMB shows.  Its gonna be tight.  So much spooning...so little time....  I wanted to put something in for Katie...i know shes having a rough time with her dog and i have nothing but sympathy for her.

      .................................*yawn*.....................................   What a long day.  Of course, its monday so i have my normal 8am-730pm day with no breaks, but today was even longer.  I had ISA stuff till 915.  Oh well....it is what it is...  Management was a thrill this morning, we spent the first 20 minutes getting our asses reamed about our piss poor performance on the mgmt exam.  I dont get it.  A whole class does poorly on an exam...and its the classes fault.  Of course, its not the teacher adapting to the class, its the students not adapting to the teacher.  Makes no sense to me. Im starting to lose faith in education....then again, what faith do i have to lose?  Border border border.  Classes with a teacher where i actually learn. More labs with overla where we goof around but end up being the first 2 to get our labs done.  Or as dr. border says, "in record time".  Im digging 442, this microprocessor class.  Learning alot about how processors handle bits and bytes.  For a geek like me, pretty damn cool.  Had a lecture in 486 that taught us nothing, but was more of a discussion on signal transmission.  Pretty slick stuff.  Too bad its a digital communication class where we are learning about AM and FM transmission.  Are those digital?  No.  ITS time.  Wow, ive never felt more missed at a job when ive taken some days off.  I love going there, have i told any of you that?  Turning off keyserver for macs today.  Had about a hoejillion calls about how to reset it.  People thinking their OS 9 macs had died.  I love playing the hero with that.    ECT 344.  Dammit Bill.  Thats all im sayin on that.  I learned some more cool stuff about signal transmission today.  Like how to encode stereo signals and decode them with no loss.  Pretty cool stuff.  After that i got to go with overla to his apartment, saw his girlfriend and their baby.  The baby is really cute.  Its funny to watch the 2 of them interact together(mike and lindsay that is).  Then off to ISA chapter meeting to work on the computers dr border wanted us to build.  Like i said, long day.  However i did get to talk to him about dr. kolla and my issues in his classes for a while.  He didnt offer much advice, but i planted the seeds in his head that im having issues.  So who knows, maybe he might be able to help me with some stuff later on.  Mac should be on its way.   Mmmmm....new mac.  Elo is hooking me up with a used 17" monitor for cheap to hold me over till i can get something bigger and sweeter.  Now i need...more ram...and thats it.  This machine is gonna be tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight..........i cant decide if i want to run os X server on it...or just 10.2.....or both...i cant handle this.  Some random quotes that didnt make the quote of the day, but are close...

      mmmmmmmmmmm....blogger goodness.  What a weekend, i know i havent updated in a few days.  I...i...I KNOW....JESUS CHRIST ON A CRACKER, I KNOW I HAVENT UPDATED, RED!!  CHILL OUT!!  Saturday i spent the afternoon with sloka at the office.  We messed around with the database, he got alot of work done, i played around with my mac, getting it to do tons and tons of badass stuff.  Man i love that machine.  I love it enough....i bought one of my own on ebay.  I know i sold my windoze server, but i got a killer deal on this thing, and i need to learn more stuff with desktop macs.  Im free to modify it more then my laptop and do more things to the hardware.  One thing i learned with my interview with apple is that i dont know as much as i think i do about apple hardware.  Soooooooo, i guess im gonna learn now, i got a barebones system coming to my house care of the mail soon...yippie!  Who knows, things go well enough...i might use it as my primary machine :-D   That night, went over to slokas and had a hell of a good time with red, sloka(duh) and katie, a new girl i met that a.) Loves Macs, b)Is into john mayer and c.) weblogs.  I put her on my link list on the side.  How cool is she!  We drank, shot the shit, made asses of ourselves....you know, same old same old.  Id say more, but i think this picture will do it more justice then i would.     Priceless red, priceless.  Today i slept(THANK GOD) then went into work for some meetings and to do some other payroll garbage.  Like i said, nothing real exciting.  Called my sister since she was having a birthday party for her 2 cats who are from the same litter today.  Should have been a good time, wish i could have been there.  Oh well... Tonite i spent some time with overla doing our ECT midterm takehome, rocked through it, since more then likely, it will be our only grade in the class....goddamn i love dr. border.  Well kidz, off to bed soon...long day tomorrow.   ************************************************************************************************************************  Positive: New G4 desktop COMING TO MY HOUSE!

      Time is winding down for the semester....  Friday was pretty slow.  Short meeting in the morning, so i did alot of office work.  Got my meeting maker and my ical all updated to december 19th.  Hopefully this will be the last time i have to input class information before im audi 5000.  Friday was Katie and my 1 month anniversary.  We went to carrabas up in maumee.  Pretty nice place, ran into deb wells from ITS up there....kind of nice.  Katie also ran into her ex, dan there...which was pretty interesting.  The food was good, and it was nice to just have a nice dinner out with the girl.  After that we went to best buy, i spent way too much money getting new speakers, a new hub and that jurassic park simulation game that ive been drooling over.  Came back, set up the speaks, the hub(mmm, 100mbit connection) and started playing the jurassic park game for a bit.  Then it was time to go see one of the craziest things ive seen here at BG.  Campell Hill 45 - Beach Party.  The crazy bastards bought like 500lbs of sand to put on their carpet....but they did lay down some plastic sheeting first.  Pretty wild.  Stayed for a bit, katie got toasted.  Listened to "The Band" which was pretty good, saw alot of hooches.....lots of young kids that made me feel REALLY old.  Oh well.  Saturday was nice and relaxing.  Had breakfast with katie at bob evans, talked for a while anout all the craziness here at school going on.  Spent the afternoon doing homework, take home exams, presentations, etc.  Katie had a "special someone" dinner for TBS and then went to Mo's recital.  I got to stay home, do homework and call my sister since it was her birthday.  Had a good time after all of that with red, haus, slooks, al, wilson, laura and donna.  Went to beyond 2000 for ice cream, then sloka haus and i went into jeds, sat down, did a tequila shot, then got some beverages at meijer, went back to reds, ordered some pizza then all laid around and almost fell asleep....god wild partiers....  Sunday, sunday, someday.  Played the homework game....then i the moment of truth came.  Katies parents invited me over for dinner.  Now, ive never really spent that much time with katies parents, other then 5 minutes here and there.  This was the first time ive sat down, had them talk to me, ask me about me, what i do, where im from, etc...Went pretty well.  Played with the dog alot and talked about all the work i do here at BG for work and school.  I think it went pretty well.  I got to fight the exam game tonight, we had 3 to do...got 2 done.  Spent more time with katie, then finally went to bed.  Meh, need sleepy.  Today is going to be a neat day with apples announcement on their digital music service.  Stay tuned to my other blog for details and a review...  *****************************************   Positive: Good weekend Negative: I Hate School Quote: "she put the hood on to hide from the funny" - me to katie trying to hide from the jokes i was making so water didnt fly out of her nose.

      blog blog bloggin on heavens doorrrrrrrrr........  What a day yesterday.  Work was fun, didnt do much as usual at ITS.  My boss decided to get on MY case on why apple doesnt put zip drives in any of their new macs.  Cause i have a say in it ;)  He was just playin, but i told him, why spend extra money for a zip drive, when cd-r drives come standard in them, cd media is so much cheaper then a zip disk, and waaaay less prone to failure.  Silence from the peanut gallery.  ECT 300 blew as normal, but at least i got to chat with Red on IM and she kept me sane.  Im losing sanity at an exponential rate as of late.  This time in the semester just plain sucks.  People are crabby, teachers are unreasonable, bosses dont want to deal with pissy employees.  Boo hiss.  Any stress possible come out at this time of the year.  Oh well, 2 weeks, and its coast time.  Spent some time in the afternoon with katie.  Finally got new laces for my doc martins that have been without for a while now.  Got a new mac addict magazine too, big article on the airport extreme base stations...of which i will be a proud owner come june 8th(happy birthday to me).  Talked to crazy old JR, whos pimpin the Verizon kiosk, drivin the YZF, bein crazy as normal.  Picked up the CD for the band that opened at the sister hazel concert, Pay The Girl.  I think this is my new favorite CD.  Its very formulaic alternative rock, but its the kind of music i need right now.  Phi Mu Alpha Funk-a-thon was tonite.  I wish i would have had time to rehearse with them, they sounded really good.  I miss playing stuff like that.  Senior night for our PMA chapter meeting too, it was the last meeting ill go to as an active member.  All of us old guys sat up in the balcony of the choral room and heckled everyone during the meeting.  It was a good time.  I tried to say something pithy to all the brothers, but it got runied by the other seniors smacking my ass while i was talking.  Meh, oh well....at least i got a cool engraved flask out of it.  Ill miss those guys.  Went to myles after the meeting...had a good time, untill people who should just stay out of my life decided to come back and wreak havoc again.  Well, scratch that.  Its not really them, its what theyve done to me in the past.  Its a knee jerk reaction, and i hate it.  I just want it all to go away, cause im afraid its going to affect things that are going so well for me right now.  (those of you close to me can already tell what im talking about)  I am so happy right now, and i dont want anything to get in the way of that.  Katie does things for me that i could never imagine anyone ever doing.  Shes so caring, so patient, perfect for me in every way.  Sorry if im sapping people out right now.  But this really has been a life changing thing for me.  Shes the best thing to ever happen to me.  So, now that i got that out of my system, im gonna go sit and think about work at ITS.  Boss is out today, playing golf...so i get to do phones.  Not so bad, i get to do blog updates ;-)  Have a good day yall, i get to speak at another co-op seminar today, have lunch with my girl, work till 5, then going to take katie to carrabbas up in toledo for our 1 month anniversary.  Tonight is also the infamous beach party at ch 45, this i gotta see...   *****************************************  Positive: Katie being the best thing ever for me Negative: Did i say its stressfull right now?

      Good evening all..  I should be doing my ECT 453 lab report now that ive been putting off for weeks, but instead im messing with both my blogs.  Oh well.  The past few days have been somewhat exciting.  Ive been able to nail down a graduation plan.  I dropped the accounting class and math 131 from this summer, going to only take mgmt 305 and physics 202.  Shouldnt be too bad.  This means ill have calc 131, mkt 442(in place of the acct class) and ect 441 to take.  Yes, this means i have to take kollas shitty instrumentation class instead of doing an independant study, but i dont feel like fighting with this man to approve an independant study.  Who knows if ill pass ect 453 or 300, so if thats the case, then ill be here to retake these goddamn classes in the fall.  Heres to hoping for a nice kolla and a nice curve to the class.  Shit, ill take a d.  In the words of steve, an old guy in my ect classes last semester...d is for done.  So yeah, this means graduation date is set earliest for december.  Hey,  i like cold weather, it should be a nice time for a party.  Or not.  I just cant wait to get done with school and get a real job and a real life.  Dammit, i have so many toys i want to buy with money from a real job ;-)  j/k  Talked to chad about my schedule at ITS for this summer, gonna be working alot there, tentatively going to be working some mad hours at RCC, and i might have another oppertunity at CTLT doing mac stuff there this summer.  I sure hope that pans out.  Heres to a job where ill actually learn things rather then be a sheep hearder.  Today also had another presentation by wags.  Todays was on G4 processors in my ECT 442 processor class.  I think it went pretty well.  Overla did his on intel centrino technology.  He was really nervous, and sick to boot, but he did a good job too.  Its funny to see people get nervous when they have to speak in public.  Its something i just do automatically now since ive done so much of it with the jobs and classes ive had since ive been here in BG.  Talking to huge groups of people doesnt scare me, i look at it like an oppertunity.  Oh well.  SPEAKING of talking in public, i forgot that today was one of the days i got asked to talk to new co-op students about my experience doing internships/co-ops.  Since ive been here 9 years longer then god and have done 3+ co-ops, i got asked to do this.  Talked for about 20 minutes on how to act, what to do, and other things that should be self evident to any human with half a brain.  It made me feel a whole lot older then i should right now.  Those kids look so young.  Tomorrow, only have ECT 300 and work @ ITS.  453 is cancelled because we need to "prep for our presentations".  I have to talk for 15 minutes on different types of communication protocols for intdustrial networks and write a 3 page paper on it.  I could do that with half my brain tied behind my back, yet people in my class are stressing.  So why is it im ok doing this stuff, but suck at the exams, but they rock the exams but stress over presentations and papers.  I think im in tha wrong major.  Whatever wags, yer a dipshit.  On that note, i think im gonna go....do something productive.  Heres to hoping that my scholarship doesnt die after this semester...   *****************************************    Positive: Finally have a graduation plan Negative: School stress, work stress, school stress, work stress... again Quote:  "i can tell when people are bein snakey, and shes rattlin' - me Song of the day: Pay the Girl - Freeze Cool Mac Moment: im totally eyeing a new mac....this is not good...but maybe the new music service will make me poor... *****************************************

      Well, well well.  Here i am, posting away here.  Not much has been going on lately since ive been back in BG.  Class was class yesterday, work was work.  I found out i may get to do alot of Macintosh specialization at ITS this summer, which would be pretty awesome.  Working with soley macs and doing what i love to do would be pretty tight.  Got kinda stressed out about everything going on, including work, school, work and school.  Trying to figure out if i should try to kill myself this summer by taking 20 credit hours, including math 131 and phys 202 at the same time during a 6 week semester.  However, if i dont do it, then im assuring myself that im going to stay here through the fall at least, maybe spring.  With the market the way it is right now for jobs, maybe that isnt a bad thing.  Why is this so stressfull to decide?  Well, for one, i dont know if i will still have my alumni scholarship after this summer semester.  That and i have 2 jobs to work this summer(as i do right now) and both of them have alot for me to do and would like as much time from me as possible.  Id love to just work and not have to worry about classes, but i know that isnt frigging fiesable.  If that was the case, then id go back to AEP this summer.  Which im kicking myself in the junk for not doing....i got all wrapped up in the idea of graduating this summer, instead of thinking about what i REALLY should do.  meh.  So i told Chad, my boss at ITS that ill decide if im going to slim my class load down a bit by next week.  I just have to get the balls to do it.  Last night, katie and i went to panera to destress, got some ice cream and watched the new harry potter movie.  I wanted so badly to watch CSI miami...but we both fell asleep at 10, woke up at 2.  Yah.  Wild friggin partiers.  In other kind of big important news, im starting a new weblog.  urlLink Brian Waggoner, Mac Evangelist   Check it out, let me know what you think.  Its a news and technical assistance site for Apple Computers.  If you have any questions about things with Macs, let me know, and i can create tutorials.  I think im going to post some of the training materials ive done for both ITS and RCC to assist people who may be looking for help.  Im off to another frigging meeting.  Andy Gross is smacking me in the back of the head with a notepad.  Ill ttyl later.   *****************************************   Positive: New Website Negative: School stress, work stress, school stress, work stress...

      A Characteristic Blog Entry: By Brian Waggoner  Here is where people will normally talk about how they havent had a chance to update in a while because school is so busy right now.  Then the ramble would continue to discuss how much we hate school and how we cant wait for it to be over because summer is going to be sooooo fun.  A discussion on someone who randomly said something nice to you and made you feel better about yourself and how you just realized how you never realized how cool they were untill now.  A discussion on how much the weather sucks/is nice right now.  Another rant on how much it sucks to be tired/sick.  Yet another rant on how you cant wait untill the weekend is here.  A long sappy discussion on who your sig oth is and how much you love them and why.  Its Friday, so a long extended discussion on what you are doing this weekend, why it will be the best weekend ever.   Conclude with a list of things that are good, bad, a inside joke quote of the day and whatever music you are currently listening to.

      Well.....what can i say.  Tuesday.  What a day.  Went to ECT 300, then went to katies, got her, played with lois for a bit(her turtle) then hit the road to go to columbus.  Had a fun drive, we were both so giddy just to get the hell out of BG and out of all the craziness that is here that just the car ride was a blast.  Once we got closer to columbus, i started getting really nostalgic about last summer and how i missed columbus.  *sniff*  We went downtown, went to a mongolian barbeque place that was a regular lunching spot for us at AEP over the summer, had an AWESOME dinner(she even got me to try tofu) and then got ice cream at the ben and jerrys scoop shop in the arena district.  We then tried to find the newport music hall, which was kind of a riot.  It involved parking about 8 blocks away, then mindlessly wandering around trying to find it.  We were pretty close in line to get in, finally got in....and goddamn.  I got to see one of my favorite bands from 10 feet away.   10 FEET!!!!!!!!!!!!  The set was awesome, Ken Block kept looking at me and smiling since i was totally singing along to all the songs with him, then pointed to me and katie and said how nice it is to see people who can already sing along to the new album...i was goin wild.  Did a good cover of Feels Like Makin Love, ended the concert with my favorite SH song, Swan Dive....i dont know what else to say.  Easily one of the best concerts ive ever seen.    urlLink PICTURES FROM THE CONCERT HERE!!   Let me know what you think of them....  I have so many more, i took over 120....  We got home kinda late, went to bed, slept through management so i could be rested and came to class, did the ITS thing, then went and did one of my presentations i had to do.  Todays was on bluetooth.  If i feel very tech savvy, i might post a quicktime of the keynote presentation.  Tonight was a katie and wags nite.  Relaxed, watch some TV, had dinner out.  Wild partiers...  Tomorrow i get to do my training for ITS on OS X.  My boss told me today hes got a pile of things he wants me to train on.  Im kinda stoked, this is a good way for me to get noticed there.  Oh well....time for sleepy time.

      TUESDAY!  SUNNY!  85 DEGREES!  VACATION!  COLUMBUS!  SISTER HAZEL!  NO ECT 453!  SPENDING TIME WITH MY GIRL!  SHORTS!  NEW OFFICE!  NOT CARING HOW STUPID SOME PEOPLE ARE!   Film at 11.     Nah, but seriously, today is a great day.  After yesterday being somewhat shitty because of some people deciding to ONCE AGAIN stick their noses in other peoples business and meddle in the affairs of others, we got it all straightened out.  Its funny, everything is perfect between katie and i, its other people deciding to do whatever they can to try to make more drama explode is whats becoming the problem now.  People that used to tell me how much they liked being around me and how fun i was before she and i started dating now just suddenly now decide im a terrible person.  Meh, whatever.  Times like this just show someones true colors.    Today will be nice, i had some meetings this morning, now im going to my ECT 300 lab...then katie and i are heading to columbus to de-stress, have a mini vacation, have fun in a big city and see sister hazel.  Im so excited i can barely stand it right now.  I need to get away from all the stupidness here at BG, so i think this will be good.  Hope all of you have a good day too, Pat McGee Band tickets go on sale tonite!  Its a good thing katie can go tomorrow....if anyone else wants to go see one of the best live bands out there here at BG in the ballroom, let me know, they are going to be here april 30th...its gonna be SWEET.  Peace out to tha 9-9.   *****************************************   Positive: TODAY IS GOING TO BE THE BEST DAY EVAR! (stole the word evar from sean) Negative: some people.....christ.

      Well Well Well.....what have we here?  Blog : Weekend Edition?  Its been a nice weekend.  Friday i spent some time with katie before she went off to do the whole girly " sit around and talk bad about boys while drinking" thing....i dont get girls sometimes.....I got drunk dialed and asked to see her later, which was fine with me, shes pretty funny when shes drunk....she also knows how to give me some pretty big scares.  Saturday....WE MOVED THE OFFICE FINALLY!!!!!  Im actually sitting in my new office right now, its pretty nice.  I hope to post some pictures of it relatively soon, its a really nice place, WAY better then harshman.  Once we get the ped issues figured out, itll be even better ;-)  After then, katie came over for a bit before she had to go get ready for her concert.  She watched me wrestle with all the cables under my desk to try to make some sense of them all.  Im sure it was as frustrating for her as it was for me.  I went, saw her concert, met up with her after it so that she could get her TBS points for helping do chairs and stands ;-) and then went back to her place.  At that point...the moment came.  I got to meet the parents.  Now, saying this was the first time ive met her parents is a misnomer.  Ive met her dad at one point before we were dating.  Also, ive talked to her mother on the phone at one point, where she called me asking if i knew of any technolog savvy college students looking for summer/fall positions working with her at the University Of Findlay.  This was the first time ive "met" mom.  I always want to work to make sure i have a good relationship with the parents of the girl im dating just because it makes everything else work so much better.  I hate friction in a relationship, especially with a girls parents.  However, i met mom, and the strangest thing happened.  I sat down, we were talking about music, and how she wants to go to the Pat McGee concert.  She then started asking me questions about issues shes having with her new 12 inch powerbook (drool)  Some of her icons werent responding to her selecting them, and asked me if i had any ideas.  I said....hmm, took the laptop, changed the resolution, moved the icons over, then changed the resolution back.  Boy she was a happy camper.  I think this is the first time i had ever had to show off my skills with computers to attempt to impress my girlfriends parents.  However, it went well, and i think i made a good impression.  After that, i went with katie to dairy queen with al, red and some other people i didnt know, had some fun conversation and then went back to my apartment....and promptly fell asleep.  Yah, we got home at 11, then fell asleep.  What wild partiers we are.  Sunday, i got up, went to see SAI's musicale, saw mom again, then spent some time with katie this afternoon.  Watched supercross on ESPN, messed with my newly installed partition of OS 10.2 server, eating dinner, etc.  She studied for her anatomy exam.  Like i said, were wild partiers.....and twice on sundays....  Now im at work, doing work stuff.  Nothing huge.  Tomorrow i have an 8am management exam, so im gonna have to peruse my notes to see whats going to be on it.  Shouldnt be too bad.  Hope everyone else had a good weekend.  Chatterbox lovin sure has gone down in the past few days....makes wags a sad boy.....  *****************************************  Positive: Good Weekend Negative: Weekend is over...boo hiss...

      Hello all....  Well, interviews are sure over.  Thank god.  Work has been kicking my ass, ive been pretty burned out.  Its gonna be nice just to relax tonite and do whatever.  Im done at 5.  Thats gonna seem so early for me, since ill be getting home when its light out.    Classes could be going better, i hate kolla.  HATE HIM.  Ill deal with it, but damn i cant wait to get past his POS classes.  I get to go play at ITS today, woo!  I found out that im going to be doing my OS X training for them next week sometime.  Thats kind of cool for me, seeing as how i have only been there since last part of december, and they already want me to train their staff.  Itll be fun to get harassed by all the full time people there, im not nervous about it at all.  Speaking of presentations, i just remembered this past week that i have 3 huge presentations to do before the end of the semester.  I guess the new dean of the college of technology decided that tech majors done have enough public speaking capability, so they want all 400 level tech courses no matter what major to have to do a major presentation.  Seeing as how all of my classes are 300+ and half of them 400 level, im gonna be busting my ass on them.  Im going to do one on the new intel centrino technology for my processors class, one on bluetooth for my digital communications class, and i god knows what for kollas process control class.  This should be fun.  Im gonna try to hammer out the bluetooth one this weekend and hopefully get it out of the way.  Speaking of bluetooth, the 10.2.5 OS update came out for MAC OS.  Wow.  I had fun last night trying to battle with my network.  I was using both my powermac and powerbook, and then suddently after restarting, both machines couldnt access my network.  I tested different thing, then suddenly had a heart attack where i thought that both machines network drivers got aced from the new update.  Then i realzed that i was getting a 169 IP address, which normally means its a network infrastructure problem and that it wasnt a problem with the hardware or software on my machine.  Sure enough, i couldnt access any machines in my workgroup in our apartment.  I tested my 8 port network switch, and sure enough...dead.  So now im using this little ghetto 10mbps hub that only has 4 ports, so just enough for uplink and my 3 machines.  Im definately going to have to get a new switch.  Especially if i ever want to build a new windows 2k/2003 server or the linux box i want to build or if id ever get my new powermac....wink wink wink....  Also along the computer issues, i found out that i cant use my version of office v.x on more then one of my macs at once.  Goddamn i hate microsoft.  However, the new bluetooth integration in OS X.2.5 is awesome. Im using my microsoft bluetooth mouse, works 100000X better then it did on my PC.  So awesome.  Katie came over last night right after i was done trying to get work done, but couldnt because i had to play network monster.  It was good to see her, its always good to see her.  I dont know what shes done to me, but i sure like it.  Just got done with my RCC senior lab staff meeting, pretty excited about FINALLY moving to our new office in saddlemire.  This office is getting to be a pretty ugly place.  New pretty office...woo, too bad we have to move on a saturday...hey, money is good, too bad im already probably going to have 30 hours for this week....  Hope all is well with everyone, im off to ITS.....come visit me today at 129 hayes, if im not there, im out on a ticket somewhere...   *****************************************     Positive: Weekend is here...

      Yeah.....been one busy yatch lately.....  Interviewin after my normally full days, then trying to spend some time with katie.  Its been so nice to have her around.  Damn this girl is something else.  Shes magic, pure magic.    Didnt do that well on the kolla exam i thought i did well on, i dont know whats going to go on in this class.  Heres to hoping i dont have to retake it.  Cause while i like BG...i dont like it enough to stay here any longer then i have to.  Actually, it isnt the town, its the fact that i pay a hoejillion dollars to go here.  Booo hiss...  Im really digging using my G4 as my primary machine anymore.  Sure AOL IM sucks for mac, iChat isnt that great, but everything else is better.  Honest to god, its just better.  Im using a 3 year old mac that works better then my almost brand new PC that i built within the last year.  Damn.  i cant wait untill i can buy a new power mac.  Then i REALLY can take over the world.  Good news on the monitor front, KDS quickly RMA'd me a new monitor, should be here soon.  Im gonna use that one for my PC, since this old dell gets better resolution and better refresh rates then that KDS POS.  Oh well, not that anyone really cares, but im just suprised KDS got on the RMA ball so fast to get a new one in the mail for me.  I have some pictures ive been meaning to post, but i dont have an FTP client on my mac yet, but once i do, ill have a picture fiasco for you all to see.  Pictures from our trip to miami to see dave and tim, some pictures of the cats, and i think this weekend im gonna go out shooting if the weather is nice enough.  Saturday were moving to our new office for RCC, so that will be nice.  Katie and i have been invited to nikki samms party on friday too, that should be fun.  I havent been to kamis in a while to see mike either when he works, maybe i can get some people together to do that.    The actual strongbad cartoon that came out this week is a riot......just....looking at a thing in a bag....drinking some drinks.....  Talk about comedy. Checkitout Checkitout Checkitout Checkitout  Checkitout Checkitout Checkitout Checkitout Checkitout Checkitout....hahahha, man im laughing at myself, god knows its late....  Tomorrow will be a decent day.  If by decent day i mean im going to bomb kollas shack since im gonna get my ECT 300 exam back.  Lets see how shitty i did on that....wooo.  Then more interviews at night, then hopefully to see katie, since she can make my day better by just looking at me.  Sorry to get mushy, but its true.  Ive never met someone who could do this to me....  Baghdad is free, iraqis are free, war is winding down.  Heres to finding saddam, finding WMD and making this whole ugly thing going away.  I sure hope that this sprouts good democracy in that area of the world.  It would be nice if that part of the world would for once be a decent place for the people who want to live there, rather then radical extremists.  AiiiiiIiiIIiiIIIIIIiiiIIIiIIiIIIight....im goin to bed.  Id like to work on my imovie project a bit, but im damn tired, and know i will be when i get up too.....I NEED TO GO TO BED EARLIER!!!  ;-)   *****************************************    Positive: Katie.   :-) Negative: Kolla.

      Well, i orginally posted a what homestar runner character are you thing....but it didnt work right, oh well.  Im very dissapointed, no new strongbad email today.  Theres something there, but no email...im wondering what the boys over at hr.com have goin on....  I was in a pretty sour mood today, just because im tired of feeling that noone is happy for katie and i.  All i hear is people talking shit about me, etc...its just really gotten on my nerves.  Granted, i dont care what people have to say about me, but at the same time, id like people to be happy that we are happy.  For whatever reason, people think this is this huge scandalous thing that we are dating.  Whatever.  Just whatever.  Im tired of people being generally assholes.  Im ending this rant now, because i should be happy because katie makes me so incredibly happy, but other people have to interfere lately.  Meh.  Full night of interviews, and a full day of classes and work....so another 15 hour day and i have an ECT exam tomorrow for kolla...yah, cause thats going to go well.    Hope you all had a good day, im just waiting for katie to come over now, its been a stressfull day and itll be nice to talk it out with someone.  Good night.  *****************************************   Positive: Possibility of only a few interviews tomorrow? Negative: People.   Being Stupid.  About something thats none of their business.

      Wow....i gotta tell you guys, i didnt think anyone really read this garbage...untill i didnt keep up on entries.  then everyone and their mom started getting on my case about updating.  Well, heres why.  Like i said in the other entries, ive been doing tons and tons of interviews.  Were talking 6-10pm every night of the week except friday and weekends.  On top of that, working my normal hours, working at ITS and class, ive been pushing myself to the limit.   I dont know why i keep pushing for things that only push back, but i guess to me its becoming a way to pay for things.  It gets to a point where i can only care as much as it takes to do a good job.  I used to pour 100% of myself into any job or organization i was in and lately i just dont feel like i get anything in return.  I work my ass off for nothing.  Its one thing to be a hardworking employee and a hardworking employee who cares.  Im starting to understand why some people just stop caring.  Oh well.  Besides work, ive been busting ass with schoolwork too.  Friday was nice just to work at ITS.  Talking to chad and all the nice ladies over there always helps me calm down.  Its such a grown up place to work.  Had a good time working with jessie too, she always brings a smile to my face.  After work, though, the fun began :)  I went and picked up katie, we went to the olive garden for dinner and had a nice time just the 2 of us out alone.  Its so nice to finally have found someone who is on the same level with me and who is just a damn pleasure to be around.  There hasnt been a time where ive been around her and i havent been the happiest ive been in a long time.  I know this may sound like mushy bullshit, but its all true.  For those of you who have known my relationship issues in the past, you could understand when i thought i may not find anyone like this again.  Not that they didnt exist, but that i wouldnt be able to open up to someone.  Anyways, i digress on that.  After dinner, we trekked through the rain to the maumee theatres and went to see phone booth.  It was a pretty good movie, and it had some good previews.  After that, we came back to my place, watched jurassic park and fell asleep.  I couldnt have asked for a more perfect night.   *sigh*  Saturday was nice.  I finally slept in and caught up on some MEAN sleep ive been missing out on since ive been working so goddamn much.    I had breakfast with Mo and Sloka, had to leave early because of family drama,  then i went home and I messed with my computers a bit, trying to get samba/rendevous to work better, or not to work better, to get ME to work better to understand HOW they work...then katie came over.  I battled the laundry monster, got pissed at my KDS POS monitor because it just up and died....which i am NOT happy about at all.  Spent the rest of the night having dinner, watching some movies, going over to CH 45 to do the normal hang out and drink thing, then staying up till all hours talking about important things.  What a night.    Today, same thing.  Catching up on sleep.  I finally made the leap to use my G4 as my primary desktop machine.  Ive come to the conclusion that in my experience(and with computers, that is fairly significant) that pc's are just better for gaming.  And by gaming, its only because that there are more out there.  High power graphics capability on macs only will boost gaming in the future.  Am i using a G4 400 MHZ?  Is it more reliable running OS X then my PEE CEE running windoze Xp anyday?  Eric and i had a moment at our meeting tonight where we bitched about how faulty XP is anymore.  It just drives me nuts how everyone is so brainwashed to how great PCs and Windows is.  Ugh.  Oh well, im not going to ever give my PC up because in my field i need to be able to use it...but if i had 2 grand to spend, Id be running to www.apple.com faster then you could say quicksilver.  I was supposed to have an ECT 300 study group tonite, but it had to be cancelled cause of some people being out of town.  Should i go study for it now?  Yes.  Will i get anything out of it?  No.  So im gonna study with peeps tomorrow inbetween classes.  Hope you all had a good weekend.  I wouldnt expect alot of blogging this week...interviews will own me.....  *****************************************  Positive: What a great weekend.  Katie makes me happy :) Negative: Weekend WAY too short...that and stupid daylight savings time....I WANT MY HOUR BACK.

      So, i know ive been alittle slow on posting the past few days, the thing is that ive just been super swamped.  Work has been murder, doing interviews every night from 6-10 which has been resulting in 14-15 hour days.  Sure, im making money...but as someone at ITS called me today, im a "walking zombie".  At least ive been able to find an hour or two a night to see katie, who has been INSTRUMENTAL lately in keeping brian sane.  Even if its just a trip to meijer to get her Dance Marathon pictures, or to go with her for a bit to keep her company at the life science building while she develops her pictures for her portfolio....it just is nice and LARGELY decreases my stress level.  So, i have an exam in kollas ECT 453 class today.  For ONCE in my life, i finally feel somewhat ready for a kolla exam.  Have i been able to study for it as much as i needed, but i kind of understand all the calculus bullshit that we do in there, even if i havent taken calc and im avoiding it like the plague....even if it means i take a 1 credit hour penalty for taking it this summer...  More interviews tonight, wooo.  Tomorrow will be nice just to have a relaxing day working at ITS.  Thats right, blog readers, i think of relaxing days as days where i work at ITS.  What the hell is wrong with me?  This weekend is shaping up to be some fun.  Looks like there is going to be some kind of get together with sloka, wilson, katie, al, mo, red, et al on friday, could be a good time, then hopefully katie and i can go on our first "date" even though we will have been "dating" for almost 2 weeks by then.  I dont know about the titles in relationships, im a boy, OK?  I fix things, talk about sports and buy her flowers.  I leave the titles up to her.  Hope all of you have a good day.  Hopefully ill post soon.  *****************************************  Positive: Being alive, seeing katie for a bit Negative: INTERVIEWS Quote: I just thought id offer my services to you - Me to Red Song of the day: Dave Matthews - Blue Water Cool Mac Moment: I love my laptop.

      Wow...i know ive been saying that alot lately, but damn.  Things have been so good lately, and some things have been so bad.  Its wierd when you actually long for the ho hums of boredom to come around, because you wont ever be suprised.  Oh well.  Monday monday monday.  What a day.  Classes all day, but the day i have been waiting for since i was born has come.  I got to go to see "An Acoustic Evening With Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds".  Had a fun drive there, had some Skyline for dinner, then got in line.  I took my digimatal camera to get pictures for all you folks, and because i heard on www.anyoneseenthebridge.com that people werent getting searched for cameras.  I figured, why not take advantadge.  We got to the front of the line around 7, show started at 730.  Then we get inside...and everyone is practically being strip searched.  Metal detectors like in prisons, wands, latex gloves, the whole shebang.  So....im like, well....what should i do...and i watched some people get through with cameras, albiet smaller ones, so i figured i was g money(bling bling).  At any rate, gary and tiff go through, i see the dude in front of me go through with a camera in his pants over his junk, blamed it on his belt buckle(that one is for you, e.schrades) and i laughed.  So i put my cell, pager, keys, wallet, headset, and camera in the basket, figuring they wouldnt see it with the pile of shit i put in there.  So, the little j. crew ween who was in charge of the door i was going through, rifled through my stuff, and made a HUGE production about me having a camera.  So i said, fine.  What do i do?  His answer?  Take it out to your car and come back through the line.  Now, the line mind you had now circled around the arena.  I about spazzed.  So, sloka and i trek out there, put it in my car and then wait in line.  715. comes.  720.  730, and we are still nowhere close to the doors.  Then, SOMEHOW, 2 more sets of doors open, and aroun d 5,000 angry college students bumrush the arena.  So sloka and i try not to get slaughtered by the stampede, end up getting in...WITHOUT GETTING SEARCHED.  Grarr.  Oh well.  Sloka got to our seats and got ready for the wildest concert ive ever seen.  Heres the setlist for you guys.  Hardcore DMB fans will get why it was so wild.   Bartender  Best of What's Around  Grey Street  Everyday (#36)  When the World Ends [extended]  Big Eyed Fish  The Stone (Wise Men Say)  Gravedigger  Jimi Thing (What Will Become of Me)  For the Beauty of Wynona  Two Step  Stay or Leave  Tim Solo ~  Grace Is Gone  Crash (Dixie Chicken)  Lie In Our Graves  Blue Water Baboon Farm *FULL w/NEW verse* Where Are You Going  Don't Drink the Water (This Land Is Your Land)  The Maker  Crush  Tim Solo ~  Christmas Song  Ants Marching  _______________   Dancing Nancies   I cant believe i was there to see the first blue water since 1997.  It was so amazing to see a show like this that will probably never happen again.  Sloka and i had the best time, and out of 10 DMB shows, this is BY FAR the best one ive been to.  The set, the energy, al;skdhf;lakds.  So good.  Long drive home after that, then to bed.  This morning, fun with meetings again.  I got to spend way too much time sitting through and sorting through applications for RCC.  Mike, nathan, mark and i ended not going to the senior staff meeting because we needed to get these going.  Im starting to get very annoyed with how everything is a huge issue, everything is last minute, everything has to be done now, now, now.  I attribute it to poor planning.  We have plans in place, then we suddenly have to up and change it at the last minute.  Also, getting screamed and swore at is always something that motivates staff, especially when the staff was trying to assist in what the supervisor wanted.  Professionalism should have a major part in jobs like this, even if it is a university job.  It drives me nuts that people can act this way and its just accepted.  Im pretty fired up about this, and it makes me wonder why i work so hard for some things sometimes.    More class this afternoon.  Kolla, just something else im looking forward to making my day oh so much better.  Then BACK to RCC when i find out i may have to do said interviews tonight.  Great.  However, katie and i are going to see Sister Hazel later this month and Pat McGee Band is coming to BGSU later this month too, thats gonna be AWESOME.  I cant wait.  Oh yah, and according to my degree audit......all of my stipulations for graduation are completed.  If by completed they mean almost 44 hours are in progress....(aka this semester and summer semester)  But still pretty cool to have it tell me to apply for graduation.  Hmmmm...the real world, here i come.  Hope all is well, and jesus, what happened on everyones chatterbox/tagboard last night?   *****************************************  Positive: Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, best concert ever Negative: Please, treat me like shit some more at work Quote: "BUSINESS GIRLS!!!!" - sloka  Song of the day: Sister Hazel - Sword And Shield Cool Mac Moment: Portable Titanium and iTunes keeping me sane. *****************************************

      Well, hello everyone.    Hope all is well...ive had a fairly uneventful past 2 days.  Working alot, from 10 to 10 both days, with my stupid ass mgmt class inbetween.  Im actually looking forward to a full week of work, rather then have a whole day off, then have to work 12 hour days to make up for it.  Thank god tomorrow is the last one of them.  Management is going well.  Its been simple math and retention from mgmt 300...which astonishingly enough...i do.  So i think i should be good to go for my exam on monday.  I got DMB seating locations from the warehouse today.  And goddamn...i got treated really well....going to 6 shows, only have lawn seats for 1 of those, and anywhere from 20th row to 30th row between the other ones.  Im going to get spoiled.   Rain tonight through sunday.  Because of this, im going to lower the Hoe Advisory to BLUE.  I think we all should be safe to go out.  If anything changes, ill be sure to let you know, but this is just a normal rainy week/weekend...intelligence points to a safe weekend with a general risk of hoes.  Make sure to avoid any areas that attract hoes, namely trendy malls, bars after 10pm, etc.    Katie leaves friday morning...and i may not get to see her tonite.  I wont get to talk to her for at least 3 weeks....then spotty for 2 weeks after that.  THEN when she comes home, im going to be gone for the 2 weekends after she gets home.  BOO!  Sad wags.  36 days untill the best DMB 4th of july weekend ever 21 Days untill the DMB tour opener 11 days untill wag's birthday  Heres to keeping yourself safe against hoes. *****************************************   Positive: Hoe Warning System Negative: only one more day with katie...

          The Hoe Security Advisory System is a means to disseminate information regarding the number and density of Hoe activity to federal, state, and local authorities and to the American people. These are labeled as the following.     •  Low/Green = Low Risk of Hoe Activity.  Poor weather, schoolwork, American Idol finale are all examples of reasons why Hoes may choose to keep themselves out of the public eye. •  Guarded/Blue = Conditions warrant an increase in Hoe-supported situations.  Warmer weather, average thursday nights or any other normal time.  Proceed with caution. •  Elevated/Yellow = Increased Hoe activity is possible.  Concerts, Weekends in college towns, any outdoor college activities could warrant this level. •  High/Orange = Specific instances of Hoe attractable situations are known.  Dave Matthews Band concerts, Malls, Saint Patricks Day celebrations as well as any end of the semester festivites can bring this about.  PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION.  •  Severe/Red = Hoe sightings inevitable.  Do not leave your house unless survival warrants it.  Make sure to protect yourself when leaving if you must.  Prepare for the worst.  I have set the Hoe Warning System to yellow for the time being, if any news of Hoe activity comes available, let me know and i will change the warning and advise preparedness immediately.

      Well hello everyone.  I hope you all had a good weekend.  Friday was a really slow day at work, and then i took katie out to hunan(mmm) and to see Down with Love.  Was a really good movie, and anyone who likes tounge in cheek movies will like it.  It reminded me of a really well acted high school play.  Ewan McGregor was excellent as always.  It was just a good time.  Gave katie her necklace i got her.  Its an amber heart pendant.  She loves amber, and i figured this would be a good gift for her before she goes away on her trip for a few weeks.  Just something to give her to remember me by.  Gonna miss that girl.  Saturday was pretty nice, i took some time to finish up setting up my room.  Got a new desk chair, a new desk for my laptop and a new lamp for my room plus some other assorted things.  After living here for a year, i finally feel like my room is getting in decent shape.  Moving my entertainment center and speakers for it was the best idea ive ever had.  The surround sound set up is more distributed now, so it sounds alot fuller.  So good.  Sunday, Katie and i were supposed to go to Cleveland, but her grandma got sick.  So instead, she did alot of work, and i took sometime to relax and get some stuff done around the house. It was nice just to relax, get some work done, clean a bit, etc.  Although, we were up at the crack of dawn to leave, so when katie came over at night to be social...we both just fell asleep at 10.  Big partiers....  Monday.  Memorial day.  w00t.  Most people are happy cause they get the day off and dont have to work.  For me, that means i have to put in extra hours the rest of the week to make up for it.  Boo Hiss.  But, i digress.  Katie and i really did go to cleveland, met her grandparents, spent time with her grandfather getting OS X on his iBook and showing him how non-evil it is.  Had a tasty brunch with them, then we were off to the rib fest.  After battling for directions ( ;-) Katie )  We got there, and parked.  Wandered around for a bit, went to the mall, got some late lunch and met up with Al and Red at the stage.  Virginia Coalition was performing at 4:15 and The Clarks were supposed to be on at 5:30.  Saw both bands.  I was really impressed with Virginia Coalition.  I had never heard them before, but i had heard OF them.  Definately a new band for me to listen to.  I like their sound alot, and im always a sucker for a rock band that has guys that can sing harmony.  They had a pretty solid set, then The Clarks came out.  Everyone was so pumped up about them.  Maybe its because i never have really listened to them before, but i wasnt overly impressed.  I think its a regional pittsburgh thing.  To me, the best song they played was a prince cover that just made me laugh.  However i do have to give props to the bass player who plays on a gibson using a pick.  Kinda nutty.  They werent bad, they just didnt do anything to really blow my skirt up.  At any rate, it was a good time out in Cleveland, ive decided that cleveland has made it onto my places i could live after i graduate.  Seeing Katie all tired and delierious on the way home was also a pretty funny time too.  Poor thing, too much excitement for her ;-)  I was thinking while i was in cleveland that ive been to a load of concerts.  One of the best things about seeing a band live is seeing them do cover songs.  Hearing one of your favorite bands cover an old hit or funny song just makes me smile.  So here i am, with the top 10 cover songs ive ever seen 10.)Ben Harper - Sexual Healing  I saw this when he opened for DMB.  Pretty solid, as we know ben harper is.  9.)Will Hoge  - Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow Pretty funny.  Will loves to use this when he closes a show.  When he opened for OAR, it made us all laugh.  8.)John Mayer - Hoes In Different Area Codes John Uses snippets of covers as intros to songs sometimes, but this one really was a riot to hear him sing..  7.) Dave Matthews Band - Long Black Veil Solid song, pretty powerful as far as music goes.  A good johnny cash cover is always good.  6.) John Mayer - Dirty Pop  John's cover of n'sync always makes me laugh.  Especially when he doesnt know all the words...  5.) Pat McGee Band - Where the streets have no name Pat's cover of this U2 song was especially good, even after playing a set of mostly new songs, he said "This is a song...not on our album"    4.) Virginia Coalition - Video Killed The Radio Star I had the biggest smile on my face listening to them play this.  This band just has so much energy on stage, and this really brought it out to its fullest.  3.) Dave Matthews Band - All Along The Watchtower A Staple of DMB songs.  Always good, especially when butch uses his keyboards to do an electric guitar solo...  2.) Sister Hazel - Feel Like Making Love Starting out the song saying "This song always makes me feel dirty" was a riot.  Another band with an insane amount of fun on stage.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAND Drumroll please!!!!!!!!!!!!!  1.) Pat McGee Band - Lifes Been Good To Me Pat's cover of Joe Walsh's song jut was priceless.  The fact that he didnt know the words, but the crowd did was so funny.  Pat took out his ear monitors, let the crowd sing some verses...it was great.  If you all have heard any bands do a good cover, let me know!  Hope everyone had a good weekend, i know mine was a good time...  *****************************************  Positive: Good Weekend Negative: windburn!

      Well...ive been trying to find a new template, but i havent been happy with anything blogger has.  I picked this...who knows.  If people like it, let me know.  Then again, i dont think anyone even reads it anymore.  Working nights has been an adventure.  Depending on which TSS works evenings with me, its either been fun or REALLY QUIET.  Some people dont talk much, so it can just be me reading the same damn articles online for the 67th time.  No, actually ive been busting ass on this new employee orientation for ITS.  Ive hammered out about 7 pages last night, and now i need to take some pictures to put in it before i can go any farther, however i didnt bring my usb cable for my digital camera so i cant offload them.  I also cant leave the TSC since im the only person here...so im pretty stuck with it.  I sure do get some interesting calls here late at night.  Some guy from the health center just called me asking who wendy was, and why she was sending him information on how to increase the size of his penis.  I just have to laugh at those sometimes.  Ive set a goal for myself this summer.  Pay off my debt.  I know ive been wanting to get an eMac, but i really think i need to pay off my 2 credit cards, get rid of one of them and then pay off as much as i can of my laptop loan.  With those things out of the way, ill feel better about buying a new computer.  Hopefully this will be easy to do once katie leaves...i like taking her out and doing nice things for her...and if i just work and go home, i should be able to save a few bucks here and there.  Also, the 40 hours a week at the new pay rate doesnt hurt.... ;-)  Management is going ok, i guess....im actually learning some things about management that i would have like to have used at RCC.  Not because i wasnt managing correctly, but it would have helped me deal with my supervisor a bit better.  Not anything really mind boggling or shocking, but just some good strategies.  However, this lady who teaches it, while nice....is the kind of person who wants to talk everything through.  Why do you have the problem you have, why do you feel that way, etc....it gets kind of annoying and difficult when dealing with situational examples.  Everything with her has to do with an employees motivation.  It could be motivation to work, motivation to follow company policy, motivation to do the right thing...it just gets kind of old.  Just like my blog rambling.  Less then a month untill i get to start the crazy DMB fiasco.  6 Shows in less then a month, how awesome is that.  w00t.  I dont know why, but it seems like everyone is acting strange, angry, touchy or really sensitive lately.  I dont know why, but its just strange to me that everyone has been acting this way or making crazy decisions lately.  I know i have been too, but i think mine has been more reactionary to other people.  Today at work was dubbed Ignorant Asshole Thursday for everyone who called in today who not only had no clue what was going on, but had to be total and complete jerks about it to US, the people TRYING TO HELP THEM....i dont get it.  Times like these just really reinforce my lack of trust in people.  I beat the Matrix game today, however i was dissapointed that i didnt get anymore girl on girl kissing at the end.  However, an extremely good game all around.  Definately solid in all my criteria.  Great story, Excellent soundtrack, authentic voice acting, great gameplay and somewhat decent graphics.  Now on to Vice City...and to wait for Half Life 2.  Im not getting as worked up over doom 3 as everyone else is...i guess i didnt get into the pc game scene untill half life came out, so that was my first real foree into it.  Unlike my crazy roommate who used to play the original doom untill he eyes bled.  Going to katies grandparents in cleveland this weekend.  Kind of scared, hope it all goes well, and i hope everyone prays for me as well.  Have a good friday all, and ill see you soon.  *****************************************  Positive: Sunny Weather Negative: people acting funny lately...

      I write for several true crime shows on cable TV, and I spend 12 and 14-hours at a time cuffed to my computer.  Recently, I went searching for a new notebook. I didn?t set out to buy a Mac, but I soon discovered that all the PC notebooks felt like plastic milk crates. Then I happened on the PowerBook, and thought to myself that this was a machine designed to be lived with.  Mac OS X was not a factor in my purchase, but I soon discovered it was a huge unanticipated bonus; it gets out of your way and lets you do your work. I?d rather sit on tacks than go back to Windows.  PowerBooks are a little more expensive, but so is a good pair of shoes ? and you wouldn?t tolerate blisters with every step just because the boots were marked down 25%. I?m convinced that anyone who lived with a Mac for a week would fight to keep it.  After writing my first true crime episode on this new Mac, I arrested my two PC notebooks. Then I booked them on charges: of poor build quality and assault with an operating system.  - Apple.com real switcher story

      Another day, another dollar.  Or something like that.   Now i dont post untill 5pm, so for those of you early morning blog readers(aka my sister) there is going to be a slight delay in updates.  Since im so busy here at nights at the TSC, i figured i should do it now.  I played some more of Enter The Matrix today.  What a sweet game.  Since i couldnt sleep, i got up early and played way to much of this.  Its really an extension of the movie...and im hoping has more information on the next film.  The real reason i like it?  Remember the scene where Persephone makes neo kiss her to get to the keymaker....in the game, persephone does the same thing with niobe.  Yeah.  2 smoking hot women...kissing....in a matrix video game....with lots of guns...and bullet time....and kung fu....wow...show me something thats better.  Well, half life 2, but its not going to have hot chicks making out, so whatever.    The girl came to visit me this morning.  Happiness :-)  Nothing really groundbreaking today in class.  I really dont know how i feel about this management class.  Not the class so much but the teacher.  Shes the annoying kindergarten teacher who had to hold everyones hand.  You know that teacher.  She has to call everyone by their first name,  make us do stupid ice breakers so we have good "class relationships"  Im about ready to puke.  Ive lost more management skills then this lady has.  Today, we also had to fill out "information cards"(i wondered if she was going to tell my mommy if i dont do my homework) and since im not mentally handicapped, i was able to write my name, phone number, p number and email address in under a minute.  So i went to shut off my phone in case someone would call me.  She then saw me, and told everyone to pass their cards into the "inconsiderate person in the front with the cell phone"  Lady, im turning it off, relax.  Meh.  At least the book is kind of interesting.  Although im honestly getting tired of hearing about the millionares that worked so hard, and still work 17 hour days now that they have made their 100th million but dont know how to quit.  Kids, not being able to realize when to relax and when to work your ass off isnt a virtue, its a sickness.  Working hard is a good thing, but if you are worth anything over one million dollars...retire....travel, relax, enjoy life...dont work.  5 hours left at work....hmmmm...  Katie leaves in about 2 weeks...i dont know how i feel about that....  Have a good evening tonite, everyone.  Heres to hoping that Clay wins American Idol, and to watching the 24 season finale after work tonite...even though i know what happens....  Peace...  *****************************************  Positive: Chicks Kissing In a Video Game Negative: I hate my management teacher Quote: PUPPY DOG CAT MANN!!!! - Max, describing the animal that rowd is...

      Welcome to the new week, blog readers...  Had a good rest of the weekend, Met the sister and husband for lunch on sunday, then took Katie on the Clarendon Hills/Oak Brook/Hinsdale/Westmont tour before we finally headed home.  5 hours later, we were back here in BG, dropped her off so she could go spend time with some friends, and i went home to unpack.  Did i unpack?  Meh....kind of.  Did i play video games like i wanted to?  Meh...no.  I totally rearranged my room.  Moved the bed around, the whole entertainment center(it is now in its new spot, in my closet...sounds wierd, but it works)  Im pretty happy with it.  I need to get a coaxial cable coupler and extension so i can run cable back to my TV, which of course is in the farthest possible place it could be from the cable jack, another power strip and some other misc cables.  This weekend, i think max and i are going to play carpenter and make another small offshoot desk so its kind of an L so i have a place to put my laptop and maybe another computer...;-)  Today, i got up at 930...since my body refuses to sleep in after my schedule last semester...messed around, played some GTA vice, wanted to play Enter The Matrix, but my tv and gamecube arent anywhere close to hooked up, so i showered ate and headed off to mgmt 305.  Wow.  This class is going to make me dizzy.  The teacher seems like shes a throwback kindergarten teacher who wants everyone to know everyone and work well and share and color in the lines.  We spent the ENTIRE first class doing an icebreaker where we had to learn something about someone that matched our initials.  Yeah.  *rolls eyes*    Now im sitting here at ITS, working from 2:30 to 10.  This should get interesting.  Seriously, go watch todays strongbad email, it has to be one of the funniest i have ever seen.  It makes me think that i go to school at Crazy Go Nuts University.  I am a Fighting Dumple.  GO DUMPLES!!!  *****************************************  Positive: Back In BG  Negative: Screw Classes  Quote: "A little email never hurt anybody, except maybe the cheat.." - Strongbad Song of the day: CGNU Fight Song - Strongbad  Cool Mac Moment: New iPod dock is sweet..... *****************************************

      Well, im sitting here at home....in my usual blogger spot.  Its nice to be in chicago again for a weekend, if just to relax...and to spend some time with the girl too :-)  Made pretty decent time on friday getting out to aurora to get the girl from BG, then home to chicago.  Got home around 10...not bad for leaving at 5.  Girl and parents are doing well, they really like her....which is good, cause so do i ;-)  Today, we had breakfast with mom since dad was out running errands, then went to see the matrix with sister, her husband and mom and dad.  What a great frigging flick.  Had some time before we went to dinner, so i took katie to oakbrook mall and spent time at the apple store since her poor little ipod is having screen issues.  I oogled the emac that i want to get and talked to all of my friends that work there.  Its funny, cause they seem like they know about the new ppc 970 macs coming out, but cant say anything....they crack me up.  Dinner at PF changs, then back here to do laundry and relax.  Gonna go to bed, get up sometime, then head back home tomorrow.  Hope everyone is having a good time this weekend, especially those of you who are far away from BG.  Have a good one!  *****************************************            Positive: Being home Negative: being hungry after eating chinese food Quote: "I feel cheated" - Dad after the matrix revolutions trailer Song of the day: Audioslave - gasoline Cool Mac Moment: Apple store....dayum. *****************************************

      Happy friday everyone...  What a week its been.  Its just like BG to take a week that ive been looking forward to since january to be full of drama and all sorts of goofy garbage.    Im finally done at RCC.  Again, i went in there yesterday and sat around all morning waiting for a meeting that never happened.  I dont know how i feel about the management over there.  One thing is for sure, i am damn glad to be done.  I worked there for 4 years, and now im just glad to get away from it.  It kind of makes me wonder if it is the people over there, or if its me.  If its me, i dont know how ill be able to have a steady career somewhere where i dont leave after a few years.  Then again, i know better then that with RCC.  Hence the 85% turnover in staff this semester.  *rolls eyes*  Reslife.  The only organization in the world that can operate like it does because its on a college campus.  Meh.  So, i heard from CTLT.  They offered me the job.  *insert cheering here*  However, i dont think im going to take it.  It only pays 6.75(i know im a snob) but for the amount of work and responsibility that isnt anywhere close to decent compensation.  Plus, i would have to cut back hours here at ITS during the summer so that i could work 40 hours in the fall as well.  I really dont want to do that because ITS is paying me more and because i like the environment here more.  Also, if i would go over 40 hours (which i would) because of working 40 hrs at ITS and then 15 at CTLT, the mandatory overtime would come from ITS's student employment budget.  Somehow, that doesnt really make sense for ITS to pay money to have me work at CTLT.  Plus there are people there that i would rather spend time with.  So im pretty sure i have made up my mind.  Sure, it would be nice administering 2 os X servers, managing a lab full of macs and learning tons of software that i havent used before....but i dont want to mess with changing everything again this soon before graduation.  Meh, im just rationalizing this to myself in my blog...so im sorry if you just read that whole thing.  Katie left for chicago yesterday, and i cant wait to see her tonite.  Its definately going to be different to see her out at my place.  Its not that i think thats not how its supposed to be, its just odd to see people from BG out in chicago.  I use chicago as my escape from BG because its so far.  5 people from BG have been to my house, Maury, Brad, Mandy, Max and now Katie...so i guess its not going to be that wierd...  Oh well, this should be a good weekend, somewhat of a vacation for katie and i before she goes off on her trip for 5 weeks.  Wow thats gonna suck.  Last night i did a very bad thing.  I went to best buy and bought not one but 2 video games.  Since when do i have time to play video games.  Apparently now.  Grand Theft Auto : Vice City and Enter The Matrix.  I played both of them all night since katie was gone....both are incredible.  The matrix is really awesome seeing as how it has extra footage that they filmed while doing matrix 2 and 3 and the whole game is directed by the 2 guys who did the movies.  The production values are great, gameplay is awesome....its quite a ride.  GTA is sweet too, riding motorcycles was the MAIN THING i wanted added in the last one...but now there are helicopters and planes too...this is gonna be good.  Plus its set in the 80s...who doesnt love the 80's?  So, i gotta give a shout out to red....shes become one of the best friends i could have found around here.  Sure we get on each others nerves, but we both do it cause we care about each other.  Yay for red :-)  So, now one of the ladies here at work is playing country music....wow....someone kill me fast...  I get to have my performance review here at ITS today.  Im not worried, seeing as how i got a raise and a promotion while i was on my probation period, i think i should be ok ;-)  Ok, im gonna stop now, seeing as how this already has been the update of jesus.  Sorry if the coke thing scandalized you all...but POP IS BAD FOR YOU!  Ok, im done now.  Peace out, yall...  *****************************************           Positive: New video games Negative: Wheres the girl?

      For those of you who know how much of a water junkie i am, check this out...   Water... 1) 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated. (Likely applies to half world population). 2) In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger. 3) Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%. 4) One glass of water will shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a University of Washington study. 5) Lack of water = the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. 6) Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers. 7) A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy > short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page. 8) Drinking 5 glasses of water a daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer.   Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?  Coke... 1) In many states (in the USA) the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 2) You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of Coke and it will be gone in two days. 3) To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl and let the "real thing" sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china. 4) To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the bumper with a rumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola. 5) To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 6) To loosen a rusted bolt: Apply a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes. 7) To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of Coke into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle. The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze from your windshield.   For your Info. 1) The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. Its pH is 2.8. It will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. Phosphoric acid also leaches calcium from bones and is a major contributor to the rising increase in osteoporosis. 2) To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous Material place cards reserved for highly corrosive materials. 3) The distributors of Coke have been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years!   Now the question is, would you like a glass of water or Coke?

      Well, if you got here, you were successfully able to navigate the new www.brianwaggoner.com  I hope you all enjoy it, ive finally merged 3 websites into one super website.  If you want to just bypass that page to get here, here are some links for you to remember.  http://personal.brianwaggoner.com - That will take you here http://macevangelist.brianwaggoner.com - That will take you to my Mac news site http://katie.brianwaggoner.com - that will take you to Katies Xanga http://red.brianwaggoner.com - that will take you to Red's Xanga(LOVE THE WAGS, RED)  If anyone wants a brianwaggoner.com subdomain, let me know.  Especially you Xanga clowns who have the hardest URL's to remember.  Id venture to say the URL of jesus.  Work yesterday at ITS was so slow i could watch it creep along.  Hardly any calls, and its just that time of the summa where nothing happens in BG.  NOTHING.  This place is so dead. Wow.  Grades came out last night at midnight, i got c's in both kollas classes.  THANK JEEBUS I PASSED!  Other then that, i got 2 a's a b and 3 c's.  Not great, but ill survive.  It was the semester from hell.  Meh.  Now i start classes on monday again, or should i say class...since im taking mgmt 305 for 6 weeks, then fizix 202 for the last 6 weeks.  That should be fun.  All while working 2:30 - 10 pm at ITS.  Still havent heard from CTLT, tho....grrr.  Saw the matrix reloaded last night at a screening in maumee.  Damn good movie, but im glad im seeing it again this weekend with the girl at home in chicago.  There was WAAAYY too much information to absorb in just one sitting.  2.5 hours of zen, philosiphy and schi-fi tech and fighting...i felt tired.  Also, if you go to see it, make sure you stay all the way through the credits, not only to hear the DMB remix, but to see the trailer of Matrix Revolutions.  Sitting here...AGAIN at RCC, when i should be in a transitional meeting, but of course, noone showed up for the frigging meeting.  So we are waiting for an hour and a half for them to show up.  An hour and a half, and im audi like a tt.  I finally got my new ipod, it is one of the coolest things ive ever seen.  Im going to attempt to do a review of it tonite on my mac site, ill let you all know when its done.  Expect lots of pictures of it too.  Let me know what you think of the new brianwaggoner.com  Either IM me or leave me something in the chatterbox!  Tonight, the girl is going to chicago to spend time with her family, then tomorrow at 5 im leaving here to go to chicago, pick her up and then go spend the weekend with my family.  First time having the girl meet the folks, this could be fun.  She has no escape route, so shes stuck there with my family....hehehehehehehe.....  May not hear from me untill sunday or monday, but ill be on AIM, and be sure to love my chatterbox, seeing as how it rarely gets love anymore.  Poor chatterbox.  Take care, and keep it real......damn im white.  *****************************************          Positive: Matrix Reloaded - so good Negative: RCC.  Wow.

      Welcome to tuesday, blog fans.  Im sitting here at RCC, waiting for people to get here, because apparently noone told me that the transitional meeting that im here for doesnt start for another 45 minutes.  Im so glad i got my ass out of bed early in the morning to come here and sit.  At least i get to post for you all.  Yesterday was a nice day at ITS.  It was a day that reminded me that not all days there are pretty days.  The difference isnt in who i work WITH, its the people i try to help.  Some people can be really cranky with me over things that arent my fault.  Oh well.  Oh, and moving 9 truckloads of old computers and monitors....thats fun too.  So now my old boss @ RCC just told me that he forgot we were meeting, so noone is coming in to meet today.  So i think im going to go over to ITS.  Wow.  One more day.  Not much else to post about...except my iPod was held in Taiwan(where it shipped from) for a Regulatory Agency Clearance Delay.  Yah, i think it has SARS.  First SARS killed 3 kds monitors of mine, now its gonna kill my ipod.  Great.  Have a good day, yall...im audi. *****************************************         Positive: Its summa time Negative: one more day...

      Well, another semester officially down.  All my exams are done, all the drama of RCC is done, all the garbage of people drama is done too, hopefully.  Its nice to hear from some people that i will actually be missed at RCC.  Too bad its not from anyone in management, who dont even seem to care that im leaving.  I get a feeling that the transitional work is more of a burdon for them then anything.  Well, more of a reason for me to get out of there.  Plus, they are giving sloka the run around BIG time with how he is supposed to do work for them during the summer.  He is helping them out, and they are givin him grief.  As sloka said, if you want to see how the real world is, dont go to RCC.  Everything there is ass backward.  2 more days, wags, 2 more days.  I had my interview with CTLT on friday, it went really well.  I dont know if i got it or not yet, he said hed let me know asap, but i have a really good feeling.  If not, thats ok, i can make everything happen that i need to @ ITS hopefully, but it would be nice to get the experience from this job.  Speaking of ITS, i really got the feeling that ive been given more responsibility.  Chad has just been treating me more like a full time person lately, not that he didnt treat me well before, which is definately not the case, just that hes asking me to do more full time things, asking me for more opinions on things, having me do some pretty important tasks.  Its funny, because i found out that Mike only wants me to work next tuesday and thursday at RCC, so i called Chad to ask if it was ok if i added more hours on monday and wednesday, and he was more then happy to have me to do that.  If i would have done that at RCC, they would give me some serious flack about it.  Dont go over hours, if you dont have work, dont come in, blah blah blah.  That whole garbage.  But to have an employer who is glad to have me come in and help, wants to give me more responsibility because he knows i can handle it and help him out....its just a really nice feeling.  One more week before i start my night time work in the TSC.  Seeing everyone leave is kind of a sad thing.  All the people who came in with me and are now graduating.  Im happy for them but jealous all at the same time.  I know i have one more semester, but i wish i could just graduate, get a real job and be on my own.  Im getting so tired of school.  19 more credit hours....19 more.....  Had a nice night with katie, we went to dinner in maumee, rented a movie, watched it...then as usual, fell asleep.  Weve both had a really stressful week, and it was nice for it to just be over.  I saved the world for katie yesterday when appleworks ate her paper, and i was able to bring it back.  Seeing as how she told me she would fail the class if she didnt get it into him on friday.  Rest assured, we got it in to him :-)  Now im off to go help her move lauras loft to Al's apartment.  The parents are coming into town tonight since my dad has a judging seminar in cincinatti today.  Dinner with them tonite at El outback(mmmm), spending time with them at their hotel, then mothers day brunch tomorrow at hops.  Gonna be good.  Hopefully i can steal katie next weekend and we can go out there for the weekend.  That would be nice since she has to go to cleveland today for grandparents stuff.  Have a good weekend, yall.  *****************************************        Positive: Semester Over Negative: Sleeepy still Quote: "You got so many bonus points there, you could be a dick the rest of your life" - katie after i saved her resume   Song of the day: Bunnies - Howie Day    Cool Mac Moment: My Ipod has shipped!!!

      Well all, hold on, this is going to be one hell of a blog entry.  Ive been hinting at some major things happening with me and my employment status.  Ill give you a rundown of it now, since its all out in the open now, and i want to let all of you who care, know about whats going on with me.  Currently im in charge of all of the residential computer labs.  Ive been in this position for 2 years, but have worked for RCC for 4 now.  Ive seen alot of changes, and ive implimented most of them.  ive helped do alot there, and lately, i just dont have the drive anymore.  Plus some personal conflict with some management things, how money is spent, treatment of employees, etc...i just dont feel it is the right place for me anymore.  Ive been looking around, and today something incredible happened.  As most of you know, i also work at ITS on campus in the technology support center.  I was asked today to take a sort of a promotion to assist in the evening running of the TSC.  Chad has been looking for a stable way to do this, and he thinks with my experience and my background, that i would be the guy to do it.  He is also trying to help me as much as he can to find a full time position within ITS.  Hes really looking to help me, and i cant even begin to tell you how appreciative of him i am with this.  So starting May 19th, i will not be working for RCC anymore, and will switch to being a full time ITS employee.  But wait, theres more.  Ive also been asked to interview for a system specialist position at the Center for Teaching and Learning Technology(CTLT).  This is a very Macintosh intensive job that entails server administration for OS X servers, and heading up their windows XP and OS X migration project.  It doesnt seem too difficult, so im going to do the interview on friday.  Ill hear what the position is, if i like it, ill do it, if not, i have PLENTY of work to do for ITS.  Only problem is, i dont know if i can work full time in the fall at ITS, which i need to pay bills and everything.  Well, well see.  Worked from 8-3 today.  Let me tell you, if this is a snapshot of what this summer is going to be like, i think ill have a great time with all these clowns.  Its so nice to see Carly back after her semester in Italy.  We are such a bunch of goofballs.  Its gonna be an awesome time at the TSC this summer.  Just you wait.  Took Kollas 453 final after work.  meh.  Didnt go well...for anyone in the class.  I told dr. kolla all i wanted was to not have to retake the class, and he told me i wouldnt have to.  So whatever i get, i guess ill clear the class.  Also, Dr. Border emailed me and told me i got 2 A's and a B in his 3 classes this semester.  So thats awesome news. :-)  Im damn tired now.  Everything is over, and now i just have to work.  8-3 at TSC tomorrow and 3-5 @ RCC.  Gotta do transitional things to get all of this stuff out of my hands and into mark and nathans.  Going to be wierd to not have to deal with it either.  Well...im going to write my official resignation letter for RCC now then go to bed.  Have a good night all, feel free to IM me and ask me more on why im leaving RCC if you wonder.  Peace.  *****************************************       Positive: New Job Negative: Leaving RCC(or is this a positive too?)

      *burp*  yeah, thats the general feeling around RCC today.  Rcc open house, meaning lots of free food and no work to do.  Its good to see everyone for one last time before they all go away for the summer or away for good.  *tear* e.shrades.  Nah, seriously, though.  Im gonna miss the kid.  Hes been an inspiration to me all through my years here.  Smart, hard working, easy to work with, very spiritual.  I just admire him.  Its gonna suck to not see you sleepy every friday morning.  Woah.  That sounded dirty.  I got the new Pinewood Derby CD from him.  For those of you that dont know.  Thats his band.  It sounds pretty good...ill have to listen to it when its not so NOISY AROUND HERE.  *Looks around the office*  I sold my old ipod on ebay today.  Not for as much as id like, but for a decent amount.  Its paying for over half of my new one, so thats not bad.  Speaking of the new one, i got impatient and called apple today, who said it should ship out thursday...meaning ill get it monday.  Boo hiss....i want it NOW!  Im fine, i promise.  Going to study for my other Kolla exam, ECT 453 this afternoon with mike, hopefully i can get a decent grade on this one like i hopefully did in 300.  I NEED to clear these classes.  New 24 tonite.  W00t.  Any of you ever wish some things in your past didnt happen?  Not because of how they hurt you or affect you, but because of how they make you act now and how they make you react to different situations?  Im glad some of the things happened in past relationships with me because they taught me what love really is, and brought me out of a naieve relationship state, but it makes me react in ways that arent condusive to someone getting close to me anymore.  i guess nothing is easy, but this sure makes things hard.  One more final, then im clear as crystal.  More news on the job thing coming....be patient all....  *****************************************      Positive: Seeing old friends Negative: seeing old friends for one of the last times Quote: Meh...none.

Woot.  I love apple. *****************************************

      Well hello there...  I know i havent posted in a few days, ive been feverishly trying to get ready for exams.  I have 3 exams, and of course, i had to have 2 of them monday 1st slot and 2nd slot.  meh, at least i got them over with.  Mgmt can kiss my ass, i didnt think i did too well on it, but as steve used to say, D is for done.  ECT 300.  Yes, a kolla exam.  Overla and i studied our asses off sunday to get ready for it.  He walked me through how to do the problems that were going to be on the exam.....and would you know it, they were on the exam.  I rocked it.  YES, I SAID I ROCKED A KOLLA EXAM.  Now, I walked out of there feeling fairly confident, however, i didnt know as much of the theory as i hoped.  So, i left mike to finish, and went to sell back some books.  Mike calls me, said he talked to Dr. Kolla about mine, cause he was interested to see how i did since he helped me with alot of it by tutoring me, kolla looked it over, and estimated a B!!!  A FRIGGING B!!!!!  Sorry...im ok now, but this is a pretty huge thing for me.  *breathes*\  Some pretty big news about something having to do with me and work.  Cant get into more, but if/when it happens, ill be sure to have a HUGE post.  Im selling my ipod on ebay since im getting one of the new ones.  I broke down, decided to get it.  I want one with a warranty, and since mine is about a year old as of this week, i figured its time to unload it.  I got the 15gb model, upgrading from my other 5gb one.  I cant wait for it to get here...so fun.  My 3rd replacement KDS monitor should be here on wed...lets hope this one doesnt die....stupid KDS POS crap.  Ok, well i think im gonna go home, maybe play some more jurassic park game...SO FUN.  One more exam, but im not studying for it or even THINKING about it till tomorrow night.  Have a good day, all, and dont let the exam monster get you.  *****************************************     Positive: B ON MY KOLLA EXAM!!!!

      Im going to preface this whole post with....wow.  Wednesday wasnt just some ordinary wednesday.  Its the day ive been looking for for over a month now.  The minute i saw that Pat McGee Band was scheduled to play at BGSU, i about had a fit.  Ive seen these guys live before, and they are so fun its not even funny.  As one of my top 3 bands(i say top 3 cause they keep switching order) I was amazed to see they would come play in a town like BG, but i wasnt close to complaining.  I had my last management class in the morning(thank jesus) as well as my last classes with dr. border, the coolest professor ever.  Kind of sad, but nice to know that im pretty much done with school....only a few classes to go till i graduate...  Had lunch with katie in the union, and on the walk over, i saw the PMB tour bus parked outside the union.  I got pretty giddy, and the whole time she and i were eating lunch, i was looking around, telling her that i KNEW that PMB was the type of band to come down and eat at the food court, hang out with people, etc...she just laughed at me...  I went back to class, then decided to stake out at the union to try to get good line position.  HAAHAHAH!  If that wasnt the joke of the day.  No line formed untill AFTER 7, which is when they said the doors were going to open...yeah. In the meantime, i watched Brian Fetchino and John Small, both PMB members just walkin around the union.   Wow was i geeking out, but i was trying SO HARD to not be "that guy"....  Waited for a while with all 10 people in line, then got to go in.  Waited for a while, met up with donna, then Alice Peacock came on around 815.  Shes ok...nothing that really blew me away.  However i was right up at the stage.  I felt kind of bad for her, cause stupid college boys decided to yell how hot she was, and that to me just makes you look like a dumbass.  Anyways, her set was over, they tore down....and out come PMB.  Pat and Brian first, just walking around like nobodys business....just wandering....john small was just kind of hanging out.  Now, you have to remember something, the other times ive seen these guys has been in HUGE venues like the House Of Blues in chicago, where they sell out 2 nights in a row, have tons of people there, and security is MAD tight.  Now here we are, with them just hanging out like this is like their living room.  They take the stage, and the room is eerie quiet.  With under 150 people, it was like having them play a show just for me...in my living room....When Brian Fetchino came out, he was totally 3 feet from me, and he and i started chatting.  Yeah, i was making small talk with the lead guitarist from Pat McGee Band.  Set list was awesome, opening up with one of my favorites, Passion.  After that, they played some new songs...and then did something that made me go nutty.  Pat was talking to us about how intimate of a setting this was, and asked for requests.  All the jackholes that barely know the band were like "Rebecca"..made my toes itch, but Katie just said "Minute" which is her favorite song...Pat's response? "Minute sounds good", and looks over to us  Pat talked to the crowd, people asking "wheres home?" when he said this was the last stop of the tour, and i shouted out "virginia!" and tons of little things.  When they went to start a new song, he said "This is a song called Annabelle, we hope you kind of like it"...i said, "oh, im sure we will pat".  Pat went "You havent even heard it yet!".  After the song, i shoulted out, "we liked it", he got a kick out of it.  Played more new and old stuff, switching the setlist up alot, played a pretty neat version of Havent Seen, which was kind of bluesy.  Came to the last song, and pat asked again for one last request....and i shouted out Pride, which has to be my favorite PMB song.  He looked at me, and i could tell.  He turned to the band, said pride, and there we had it.  The whole night, i had been messin around with Chardy, the percussionist and Chris the drummer, like chardy would do wild things and id point at him, i got chris to do a drumstick flip, etc....so when i was the only one to start the "woos" during the pride intro, needless to say, Chardy about had a cow.  The rest of the crowd got into it, and the song just rocked.  Set was over, and chris the drummer took his setlist off of his drumset, came up front, handed it to me and shook my hand.  After that, Pat came out, did a solo version of Shine as an encore, and that was the concert.    As far as the rest of the night...wow.  I got the setlist signed by the whole band (pictures to come) chatted with each band member for a while, especially Chardy, who has been my hero since day one.  All those guys in the band are really cool.  They all were totally down to earth.  I was just in total shock, cause this sort of thing will never happen again.  Im not saying PMB is a huge band, but the chance of having a concert like this with a band like this...wow.  Never ever again.   urlLink Here are pictures from the night...prepare to be amazed...   Now Katie and I need to get our little selves onto the Rock Boat cruise....PMB, Sister Hazel, Edwin McCain....wow..  Well, back to work....heres to another concert as frigging incredible as this.....  *****************************************    Positive: Could be the best concert experience ever...

       I KNOW ALREADY.  I HAVENT POSTED IN A WHILE   Wow.  The grief i get from some people.  Its been a pretty busy week or so.  Work was hell, so much to do, some reorgs in the office physically(we moved my desk and we got a new G4 system to go on that desk...mmm) and impending job reorgs in the office too.  It could get crazy around there.  Especially since i guess some people claim that im treated differently then the other student staff in there.  I could go on about that, but i have pride and tact and wont do that.  *shakes head*  Have had some quality friend bonding time.  Been spending alot of time with B lately.  Hes been a good source of sanity for me in the otherwise insane world.  Which for those of you who know the situation of a few weeks would laugh if you read that.  Some situations get blown out of proportion, and in the end, not only did it work out, but things are really great because of it.  Supposed to hit my 3rd fo 6 DMB shows this weekend, but other circumstances came up.  Sucks, but it happens, i guess.  I still had friday off from work, which was nice and relaxing.  Spent the whole weekend only doing one thing...playing star wars galaxies.  Greg, one of the guys i work with beta tested the game, and we both preodered it.  We got it on friday and i played it incessantly this whole weekend.  This weekend...and anytime im on im now known as Detoun Iceew, a Zabrak(the same race as Darth Maul from ep 1) who is an aspiring weaponsmith.  Ive done enough missions for the empire where i am now an overt operative for them with a rank of Private, working on lance corporal.  The game is pretty sweet and greg and i did some general ass-whooping.  Good times were had by all.  *insert 45 minute break of time to talk to  katie on the phone*  Yeah, so i just found out that katies grandparents may be coming in to town, or katie might have to go out to visit her grandparents the weekend she gets back..and she wouldnt be back untill monday or have to be with them on monday.  Yes, meaning i may not get to see her the day i get back...also known as THE FIRST DAY POSSIBLE TO SEE HER IN 6 WEEKS!!!!!!!!!!  Yeah...that is fate kicking me straight in the yammies.  Yeah, i guess weve gone this long without seeing each other...one day wouldnt matter that much, but im missing her so much right now and shes missing me too...it just...blah.  Ok, im off to bed, up at the butt-crack of dawn for fizix recitation and lab.  W00t.  Im so excited.  Night all.  *****************************************   Positive: Star Wars : Galaxies Negative: One week from today?  maybe?

      I know i havent updated in a while, its been a busy couple of days.  Had a good time hangin with B and company, did some quality Haloing and grillin at wilsons on sunday.  Good times were had by all.  Bonding time with another level headed guy is always something wags needs.  Lots of stuff going on with school, this is the equivlant to the week before finals week in fall and spring.  2 exams this week in management, had one on monday and the final on friday.  Good thing she cancelled class tomorrow, lets me sleep in a bit after working a 14 hour day today, and still get in time to make up for taking this friday off.

      I don't get many things right the first time In fact, I am told that a lot Now I know all the wrong turns, the stumbles and falls Brought me here  And where was I before the day That I first saw your lovely face? Now I see it everyday And I know  That I am I am I am The luckiest  What if I'd been born fifty years before you In a house on a street where you lived? Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike Would I know?  And in a white sea of eyes I see one pair that I recognize And I know  That I am I am I am The luckiest  I love you more than I have ever found a way to say to you  Next door there's an old man who lived to his nineties And one day passed away in his sleep And his wife; she stayed for a couple of days And passed away  I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way to tell you that I know we belong That I know  That I am I am I am The luckiest

      Well hello all...  Another few days since ive posted, and some pretty awesome things have happened.  I worked 8-1 on tues, then went to class.  After class, i met up with SLOKA!!!  He came out all the way from pittsburgh to head down to columbus with me to see DMB.  We carpooled with good ole gary budar and his lovley girlfriend lauren, who incidentally was in my management class for a few weeks...and i didnt even know.  Im sorry lauren...i suck.  The show was awesome.  Heard moe. open, and they were ok.  Not great, sounded like a mumbling phish, but still pretty good.  This however, was the first time i had ever seen a tour opener for DMB, so expectations were high.  Here is the set that they played.  Too Much When The World Ends If I Had It All  Crush Rhyme & Reason Bartender You Never Know Stay Grey Street Typical Situation Loving Wings Where Are You Going Last Stop  Everyday Tripping Billies  Encore:  Grace Is Gone  Don’t Burn The Pig  Incredible.  Dave messed up some lyrics here and there, especially in When the World Ends, which made it about 2 minutes long(which is fine IMO).  Sloka and i had a great time.  Great seats, good crowd and fun atmosphere.  We got out to the parking lot, ended sitting there for about an hour, while i talked to katie on the phone for a bit.  Got home around 230, put sloka to bed and talked to katie for a bit more.  She finally got to the college part of her trip, so she has a dorm room with a phone.  I finally got to bed around 330, and was up at 645 to get myself and sloka through the shower.  So i could be at work by 8.  Worked 8-1 again, then class...then it was time for Red and Wags day out.  We went to DMB night 2.  Drove down, had some fun times, some serious talk and alot of fun.  Tasty dinner at Max and Ermas, then saw the best DMB concert i have ever been to. Which is about 10.  Heres the set for last nights show. Granny  So Much To Say  Don’t Drink the Water  One Sweet World  Pay For What You Get  Kit Kat Jam  Dancing Nancies  Cry Freedom  The Maker  Lie In Our Graves  Fool To Think  Dreaming Tree  Crash  Jimi Thing  What You Are   __________________   Stone  Ants Marching  What a show.  Dreaming Tree would have been worth the 50 bucks just to hear, but pay for what you get?  Both those songs havent come around in years.  Cry freedom and dancing nancies are definate rarities too.  What a time.  At any rate, red and i had a great time.  The drive was so fun.  We had some pretty funny moments.  Also got to talk to katie again while in the parking lot.  Shes also back online from time to time, look for her!  She also updated her xanga....but im still missin her...  Today was work and class all day.  Boo.  Plus im ass tired, but i have a new rising stars trade paperback to read to make me happy.  Im gonna do some work on the training docs, eat my taco salad from pollyeyes(mm, tasty) then read me some comics.  Im tired and cranky..so im audi.  Lookin forward to halo'ing it up with B this weekend...  Peace out, yall.. *****************************************  Positive: BEST.  CONCERT.  EVER. Negative: 18 days.

      Start time of blog entry: 5:20PM  Hey all -  Hope everyone had a good weekend, with fathers day and all.  I had a fairly nice and relaxing weekend.  I had a very nice weekend, let me recap! :-P  Friday, worked 8-5 at ITS.  Busy busy friday.  The most interesting thing of the day is Chad assigning me to work on a 17" Powerbook that someone brought in because he couldnt get it to boot.  Oh, and he forgot to tell us that he dropped the damn thing, which isnt hard to MISS when you look at the back and see the dents, scratches and marks from where it was dropped.  I rassled with it for a while, then finally figured we would wait untill today to deal with it.  Max, Cari, Elo and I went out to Jeds for dinner like the happy lil family we are.  Had a good time, had a few beers, then came home and watched Die Another Day, the James Bond flick i got for my birthday.  Not bad, but not the best bond movie ive seen.  After that, max and i stayed up while i negotiated with this crazy lady from new york to buy her quicksilver g4 off of her.  I got a pretty good deal.  Its a Quicksilver g4 800Mhz, CD-RW, 40Gb HD, 256 MB ram, Final Cut Express and a scanner for 1000.  After i get it and transfer over my files and applications, im going to sell my G4 400Mhz on ebay(i should get around 500$ for it, so 500$ for this new G4 aint too bad), put my 120GB hard drive in the new one, put an old 20 gb drive in the 400mhz and leave 128mb ram in the 400Mhzand put the 384 in the new Quicksilver.  I wanted to get an emac, but didnt need the monitor, but wanted the flexibility and expandability of a powermac.  I know my parents promised me a "mac of my choice" when i graduate, and this one i just got has the horses to do what i need untill december or january when i graduate.  Plus its coming with a scanner and final cut express, so i can do more with digital imaging, photography and movie making.  Should be nice.  Im excited.  Now once i get paid on friday, shes going to send it out to me.  Hopefully mid next week, ill be the proud owner of a quicksilver G4.  Next on my ebay list of things to get, a 15 inch LCD apple studio display.  For 200$, you cant beat the picture quality of the digital output.  Im losing my love of CRT monitors.  Too dull. Yich.  After going to bed, the next day i was woken up by bobbins who got all riled up after cari played with her in the morning.  I got alot of work done during the morning, so i did more communication with crazy new york mac lady, organized my room and did other things here and there.  Red and i went to Hunan for some tasty dinner, chatted for a while then i went back home to start working on moving some computer parts around.  I wanted to see if the burner thats in my PC(that windows XP hates with a passion) would work in my G4.  Alas, it didnt work.  I also did some stupid things with my PC so that now it doesnt boot.  FYI, dont delete linux partitions if you dont know what you are doing.  Its not smart.  Now i have to take the 80 GB drive out of my Mac, put it in my PC, do a fresh install of windows on that, slave the 20 to it, pull off the data, then format the 20Gb drive to put in my old g4 when i go to sell it.  After all of this, i will have 3 desktop machines with the following statistics.  Pentium 4 1.6A GHZ 512 MB Ram 80 GB Hard Drive Windows XP 17" KDS CRT Monitor  PowerMac G4 (Quicksilver Model) G4 800 MHZ 640 MB Ram 120GB Hard Drive Mac OS 10.2 Jaguar 17" Sony Trinitron Monitor(soon to be 15" LCD Apple Studio Display)  FOR SALE PowerMac G4 (Sawtooth Mode) G4 400 MHZ 128 MB Ram 20 GB Hard Drive Mac OS 10.2 Jaguar (EST Selling price ~500$) If anyone is interested, send me an email at bjwaggoner@mac.com  Yeah, sorry for getting so technical in my personal blog, but this is my hobby, and love doing this stuff.  Muahahahaha...  Sunday, i got up, tried messing with my stupid hard drive mess up on my windows machines(man windows pisses me off) and then at 1, I left to go to Tom Gruzs's Graduation Party in Columbus.  2.5 hours down there, but what a beautiful day to drive.  I had a great time at tom's party, it was good to see him and leslie(his girlfriend of like 6 years or so).  I also got to see Randy Tackett, who was in the Intel Server Platform Services group that i worked in last summer at American Electric Power.  He was telling me about all the different changes at AEP and how i would hate it there now.  He said that almost everyone wants to quit because of all the stupid changes that have gone on, and even if i didnt have to stay and take classes this summer, that i wouldnt have even had an internship position again.  That sucks.  However, Im really glad tom got a job there, hes put in alot of time with them, and really deserved a good job from them.  Id love to work there, and while its windows stuff, i wouldnt mind doing it, id just REALLY rather do work with Macs for a career.  Problem is its a niche market.  Heres to hoping i get a gig with that.  After i drove the 2.5 hours home, i got a call from Franklin telling me they were grilling out over at our friend Chris Hauk's apartment.  I went over there, had some meats and beers, then came home with full intention of fixing my PC, instead, i went to bed.  I was kind of worked up because 1.) I had some alcohol in my system and 2.) because Katie called me while i was at chris's.  Normally, those should be good things, right?  Well, katie called me to tell me that she fell on her hand again(the hand she broke last summer) and had to be taken to the hospital, but it wasnt broken because she was wearing her brace on it.  So thats good, but she was so upset, sounded so stressed and so sad...and i couldnt do anything about it.  Thats what sucks so bad, is i cant do anything to make her feel better.  Maybe i shouldnt nag her, and know that no matter what i say or do, shes going to climb and fall, but i worry about her and care about her.  Only 2 more weeks from friday.  I cant wait.  Today was a little different, i came into work at 10 and worked till 1, then had class from 1-230 and then im working 230-10.  Hopefully ill be able to stop by BW3 tonite for a bit to hang with B.R.A.D W.  Dont know, though.  Im working more hours in the morning because im taking tuesday and wednesday afternoon/night off.  Why?     DMB BASH 2003     Thats right, kids.  6 shows in 3 weeks.  Tuesday and wednesday, ill be in Columbus, Ohio for the first 2 shows of the tour.  This is the first time ive been able to go to a tour opening run, im hoping its going to be great.  Sloka is coming into town tomorrow for the show.  Its gonna be nice to spend some time with sloka again, i miss the kid.  Wednesday, Red and I are heading down for night 2, and hopefully having dinner with Tom and Leslie.  Gonna be goooood.  I think thats all for now, thats whats going on with me, its been a pretty eventful weekend.  Looking back, this was a pretty haus entry.  Lol.  Oh well, feel free to leave love in the chatterbox!  *****************************************  Positive: DMB TOMORROW AND THURSDAY!  Seeing tom and dinner time with the crew.

      I LOVE the weather.  Rain is just so....rainy.  How is everyone doin lately?  I sure dont know, cause i dont really talk to anyone.  I hope everyone is doing well.  Work is going really well.  Ive been really fulfilling my job since i got the promotion to Help Center 3.  I found out chad and mike didnt hire me to answer phones and help with customer service stuff, they hired me to do more technical work.  Heres what ive been working on so far.  #1.  New employee(and refresh info for current employee) handbook.  This thing is to ITS what the lab team handbook was to RCC.  Back when donna and i worked on that thing, that was a beast to make.  But, its going to be good.  Its already almost 30 pages and has lots of good info, so well see what happens. #2. Being the contact support for high level OS X service and support.  This is what takes up the most time.  Most OS X questions that come in to the TSC come to me.  If i dont know the answer, its my job to look them up, research it and find out how to solve the problem.  I love doing this part.  Its so awesome. #3. Train the TSC staff on new mac updates.  Stay on top of hardware and software and keep them in the loop. #4. Create a CD that can boot into OS 9 and to a Windows command line that also has all of our disc recovery tools on it for future use. #5. Run OS X Certification training for the Technical Support Specialists.  I find this funny because...a) im a student training full time employees. b) im not apple certified and c)i have no idea about apple certification.  Getting stuff for the service and support exam is actually going to be really easy, however, finding out that ill be doing the training, yet the university may not pay to have me certified is kind of shitty.  But, were working on that ;-)  Thats it for now, but its a pretty healthy list for a student employee.  Otherwise, ive been pretty tame.  Katie got a chance to call me today, a very short call, but it was nice to hear her voice for a bit.  Man i miss her.  Red came in to work tonite to see me.  Always nice to see her.    Now, work is almost over, so its going to be time to go home, make some dinner, then :moof: some more.  I love the mac irc channel...hehehe.  How else would i get an alpha build of iTunes for Windows.  Pretty slick.  3 Weeks of Crazy DMB Madness starts next tuesday.  Can you feel it?  Can you feel it?  Oh, i can.  10 days untill WWDC.  Mmmmmm....that deserves a :moof:  Talk to you all...maybe...or sometime...or something.   *****************************************  Positive: Katie calling and seeing red Negative: 3 weeks till katie comes home Quote:  Where the streets have no name  We're still building  Then burning down love, burning down love  And when I go there  I go there with you...

      Wag's New Motto                       I am a mountain I am a tall tree Ohhh, I am a swift wind Sweepin' the country I am a river Down in the valley Ohhh, I am a vision And I can see clearly If anybody asks u who I am Just stand up tall look 'em in the face and say                       I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high I made it I'm the worlds greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against the ropes I can feel it mmm I'm the worlds greatest  I am a giant I am an eagle I am a lion Down in the jungle I am a marchin' band I am the people I am a helpin' hand And I am a hero If anybody asks u who I am Just stand up tall look 'em in the Face and say  I'm that star up in the sky I'm that mountain peak up high I made it I'm the worlds greatest And I'm that little bit of hope When my backs against the ropes I can feel it I'm the worlds greatest   What a day its been.  All full of ups and downs.  After talking to katie for the last time for a week.  Its going to be hard, but i know she misses me just as much as i miss her, and that makes me feel a little bit better.  Missy - I used the foreman today.  That thing is tha bomb.  Thanks yo.  I didnt even burn my hand on it either!  Took my 2nd management exam today, i think i did pretty well on this one.  Lets hope better then the 76% on the last one!  Work today was a zoo.  Since it took me 25 minutes to fill out the 40 multiple choice questions on my exam, i got in to work at 130 instead of 230.  From the minute i got in there, it was like the floodgates on work for brian were opened.  We had our student staff meeting yesterday, and it went well, and i pretty much just sat back and listened.  Im not the type to try to dominate a meeting like that.  Ive been working on this documentation as well as training on spyware and a CD that will boot into both mac OS 9 and boot to a command prompt in windows.  Not only that, but compile all of our smaller disk rescue tools on it.  I started working on that, while having people call 0999 asking specifically for me, needless to say, i didnt get much work done.  Once chad got back from his lunch at 2(that dude is crazy, not taking a lunch till 1, then again, i dont ever take a lunch, but whatever) he asked me to call up a lady who had a ticket to have os 9.2.2 on her brand spanking new G4 powermac.  Now, she had some applications that needed to run in 9.2.2, but for some reason werent running in OS X. (hold on, non mac users, this is gonna get somewhat technical)  So, he told me it would be a quick call, since i was the one to inform the office that since she is using the latest revision powermac, apple has made it so you can only run Classic(a 9.2.2 emulator) but not boot straight into 9.2.2  So i call this nice lady, and its not that, shes just having trouble getting pagemaker installed.  So instead of playing the chess game over the phone, i go over to...yes, academic enhancement.  The one place on campus that has more love for me then anywhere else(except maybe the TSC).  In a roundabout way, i get pagemaker not only on her system, but on 2 other systems that needed when they thought they couldnt use it because of the OS 9 restrictions.  I took care of them, and had them saying so many nice things about me.  The grad student who initially called offered to name her first born child after me.  I politely thanked them, blushed and went back to the office.  By then, it was close to 5, so i got a salad from the union, came back and got settled in for the long night shift.  Long night shift indeed.  It went by so fast.  I was hammering away at this documentation, i didnt even notice it was time to go at 10.    So here i am.  Just talked to Jessie on the phone for about a half hour, eating some steak i cooked on my new george foreman grill i got from my sister for my birthday.  Im only thinking about 3 things lately.  1. How much i miss katie 2. The new machines apple is coming out with 3. 6 DMB shows in the next 3 weeks.  Thats right.  6 shows.  Next tuesday and wednesday, im going to the 2 shows that are going to open the tour.  Then the weekend after that, im going to spend time with sloka in da burgh for a show out there, then the 4TH OF JULY WEEKEND OF JESUS.  3rd - DMB @ Tinley Park, IL 4th - Celebrations with the family 5th - DMB in Alpine Valley, WI 6th - DMB in Alpine Valley, WI.  What a great time.  Ok, im gonna go watch letterman, kilborn and some other garbage on TV....since i cant sleep anymore.  Have a good night all, and ill probably not talk to any of you later...since i dont hear from anyone anymore.....  Im going to end tonite with more song lyrics, rather then my normal bit, since this has been my song of choice lately.    Nite all.  I want to run  I want to hide  I want to tear down the walls  That hold me inside  I want to reach out  And touch the flame  Where the streets have no name    I want to feel, sunlight on my face  See that dust cloud disappear without a trace  I want to take shelter from the poison rain  Where the streets have no name    Where the streets have no name  Where the streets have no name  We're still building  Then burning down love, burning down love  And when I go there  I go there with you...  (It's all I can do)    The cities a flood  And our love turns to rust  We're beaten and blown by the wind  Trampled into dust  I'll show you a place  High on ta desert plain  Where the streets have no name    Where the streets have no name  Where the streets have no name  Still building  Then burning down love  Burning down love  And when I go there  I go there with you  (It's all I can do)

      Hey all  Yeah, im officially 22 now.  Whoop-te-do.  Birthday wasnt overly exciting.  Had dinner, spent the day doing nothing.  Took a trip to the apple store with my dad just to look around.  There is definately some very very cool stuff going on at apple.  The next 2 weeks are going to be neat to see what eventually comes of all these rumors.  After dinner, i drove the 5 hours back to BG and got the only thing i wanted for my birthday present.  Katie called.  It was so good to hear from her since i didnt hear from her since thursday.  My phone was acting screwy so everytime she called it went straight to voicemail.  We talked for a good half hour.  Shes having some rough times out there, and it sucks that i cant see her and make her feel better.  I hate hearing her sad, and what kills me is shes worried about me being upset about HER being upset.  I just want her to be happy and not have to deal with any stress, but i know that thats impossible.  Im just starting to miss her REALLY badly.  Plus with some of the people on her trip being assholes and her hurting her hand again, i just want to make her feel better. Blah.  Class and work today, i found out i got a 76% on my first MGMT exam.  Woo.  Not bad, but not great.  Need to step it up a notch for tomorrows exam.  Work is good, but man, some of the people there are starting to drive me batty.  I think its more of me being in a bad mood lately...meh, who knows.  Katie called me again today, and i couldnt talk because i was the only person staffing the TSC.  She called to give me the bad news that where she is going for the next week wont have a phone for her to call me...so i wont hear from her for a week.  That sucks.  As if im not down enough from missing her, now i cant talk to her and at least know shes having a good time out there.  Maybe its just me, but it seems like everyone is getting into the same thing they did last summer.  I feel like noone around here has any interest in what im doing or whats going on with me.  I barely hear from anyone anymore, and if i do, its just for them to vent to me about something.  I gotta tell you, this is all really contributing to my bad mood too.  So yeah.  Here i sit at work, not motivated to do anything, feeling shitty cause im missing katie and pissed off at a bunch of things now.  I dont think anyone even reads this thing anymore.    Blah.  I miss you  I miss talking all night long with you  And I need this to find a way to your home  My love can you hear me  Have I been hoping loud enough, wishing hard enough  Can you see me when I'm asleep all alone - alone   *****************************************  Positive: blah Negative: blah  Quote: blah  Song of the day: Sister Hazel - best ill ever be  Cool Mac Moment: g5s are gonna be cool.  *****************************************

      Hey everyone...  I know i havent posted in a while...not much really that interesting going on for me to talk about.  Get up, do work.  Go to class.  Go to work.  Get home at 10.  Watch late night TV.  Go to bed.  Repeat.  I decided i need a new hobby...i want to do something with computers, but i dont have the money to start a new computer project yet.  maybe ill start building a new computer...meh, who knows.  Id really LIKE to get a faster mac, so that i can turn the powermac i have no into a server and mess with OS X.2 server...which i cant do if im using it as my main machine right now running jaguar.  Meeeh.  I dont know.  For now, im going to start saving money up.  and pay off bills.  Maybe ill put alittle away for the emac?  Going home in about an hour to spend time with the fam for my birthday.  Woo.  22.  This means...im older?  Oh well.  That, and all this buildup from my sister about what present she got me is driving me bonkers.  Shes such a tease.  Hope everyone has a good weekend.  Here are some lyrics.  Just reminds me of my current situation.  Take Care all.  BEST I'LL EVER BE - Sister Hazel Lyrics by K. Block Music by A. Copeland   I miss you I miss being overwhelmed by you And I need rescue I think I'm fading away But I keep thinking that you'll wake me up with a whisper in my ear I keep hoping that you'll sneak in my room   So I wait and I wait And I run old scenes through my tired head Of the days we laid by the school and said forever Was that the best I'll ever be   I miss you I miss talking all night long with you And I need this to find a way to your home My love can you hear me Have I been hoping loud enough, wishing hard enough Can you see me when I'm asleep all alone - alone   So I wait and I wait And I run myself in the same old circles I sit and I stare And I run old scenes through my tired head Of the days that we laid by the school and said forever Was that the best I'll ever be   Can't keep my hands from shaking Stumbling through the wreckage again But you're gone   So I wait and I wait And I run myself in the same old circles And I sit and I stare And I run old scenes through my tired head Of the days that we laid on our backs and said forever Was that the best I'll ever be

      Well, here i am...at work again.  Im taking a break from working on the worlds most including training book/handbook/modular information manual.  This is the first time anyone really has done something like this for ITS, at least in the Tech Support Center, so im pretty enthused.  Also while trying to be both the Windows XP and OS X guy, im really learning alot more then i thought i could.  Its nice that it gets pretty quiet around here at night, so i can focus on all of my specializations and get that stuff going.  Its nice to see Bill Palmer poking his head in here from time to time.  Hes got a great site that i have linked on the side.  Check it out.  Mgmt test went ok.  Dont know what i got on it cause the teacher is a nazi.  More on that to come.  I know ive been slacking on the updates here somewhat, but ive been spending alot of time on my mac site.  Making sure that i have all the latest and greatest news for Apple products. Yesterday i did a full review of the 15GB 3rd generation ipod, and have posted some semi-exclusive pictures of what could be one of Apples new Web Applications for .Mac.  If you like any of that stuff or want to see what the site is like, click on the professional blog link in my link menu.    Everything else is going.  Going well or going bad?  Not really.  Just going.  Counting down the days till my birthday...even though not much will happen then.  Leave some love in the chatterbox.  *****************************************  Positive: Happy with my mac website  Negative: All my hobbies/projects are done..need new ones..

      Hey all -   Wow, this is going to be the 3rd time ive tried to make this post.  First time, i was an idiot and closed my browser window.  The 2nd time safari took a dump.  Meh.  At any rate, i can do this entry by heart now, so here goes nothing.  I know i havent made a real post since wed.  With me working till 10 at ITS and with katie getting ready to leave and eventually leaving for her trip, ive had alot on my mind and on my plate.  Too much to explain, let me sum up.  Thursday was thursday.  Had my last management class of the week, did some light reviewing for my exam i have on monday.  Worked the 10-10 and then spent some time with katie that night.  It wasnt that much since she had to be on the road for her 3 day trip at 630am, but it was nice to see her before she left.  Knowing she will be out in the boondocks for 3-4 weeks i didnt think id hear from her untill her trip switched over to its more campus type portion.  At any rate, i was sad to see her go, but i know she'll be having a good time with rocks, plants and little aminals.  Friday, after working 12 hours and being up late with katie, i dragged my sorry ass into ITS at 745.  Always fun.  Not only that, but because people can work summer flex hours, the afternoon on friday is always dead.  So the afternoon was pretty much Me, jessie, marv and mike.  We made the best of it.  Marv brought us Ice Cream, ole Jimmie K came down to harrass us for a while, and we joked around with the kids in hardware support.  Good times.  After work, i went and got Red for our Hot Date.  We went to hunan, saw finding nemo and spent alot of time talking about everything going on with her and my life.  She and i pretty much think the same on most everything, so it was good to talk to her and get some feedback on things.  Shes such a great person to be around, and spendint time with her just reminds me how much i care about EL red.  :-)  Came home after that, and was just hanging out...when the phone rings.  Looking at the caller ID, it was an area code i didnt ever see before, so i almost didnt answer.  Then it hit me.  Katie found a phone and was able to give me a call and fill me in on what shes been up to.  It was nice just to hear her voice again.  I went to bed after that, feeling a bit better.  Saturday...i didnt do anything.  I finished catalouging all my music in itunes.  Thats it.  Katie was able to call me not once but twice.  Made me happy, but since they get to the campground tomorrow, i dont know when ill hear from her again.  It sure was nice to know shes ok and having a good time.  I wish i could see her tho.  Today has been spent watching the news, eating eggs, studying and now im going to head off to wal mart to get screws to finally fix my sunglasses and deposits some moneys.    Maybe ill catch some quality sunday tube.  Could be a fun time, but i still have some reviewing to do for my exam.  Even though its over the last 3 days of lecture.  Gotta love summer classes.  Oh, and im lowering the hoe warning...it seems like things are simmering down a bit.  Only to  orange though....  Dont forget kids, only one week untill my birthday.  Heres to june 8th!  I miss you katie. *****************************************    Positive: Relaxing weekend Negative: katie is thousands of miles away Quote: I want a divers helmet to sleep in...and spoon in - me to red while watching finding nemo  Song of the day: OAR - She gone  Cool Mac Moment: More PPC news coming out...and only 20 some days untill WWDC! *****************************************

      Hello all...  Not much going on lately of note.  Heres a day in the life of me.  Wake up at 6:45, shower, get dressed, find something to eat and head to one of my 6 different times i meet for physics that week.  8:00am.  Physics...something.  Monday/wed its lecture.  Tues its Recitation(aka bring beer for the teacher and you get full credit for the quiz) and lab.  Friday its only lab.    Home for a quick bite to eat after all that jazz, maybe an hour or two to relax, play some Star Wars Galaxies, or to go to Univeristy Of Findlay to work on this contract job that i have signed up for.  Then its off to work at ITS from 2-10(monday through thursday) or after class untill 5 on friday.  Repeat.   Lather.  Rinse.  Repeat.   Its getting really old.  I hate physics, i hate the BS corrupt teacher we have and how noone will stand up to him.  Im pretty much getting really tired of working nights, just in time to come home, not have energy to do things i need to just so i can go to bed and wake up and do it all over again.   Hopefully that is ALL about to change.  After next week, summer classes will be over.  BUT, today i have decided to apply for a full time job that opened up on campus.  Its 40 hours a week, salary, benefits..the whole shebang.  Its working for IMS, pretty much doing what im doing now, so it should be a real good thing if it works out.  Rumor also has it that there may be a TSS position opening up here at ITS that im going to look into as well.  Meh, thats the general attitude.  Thats all for now, ill talk to you all later.

      Yeah, i know havent had any posts of merit lately.  Its been one of the roughest weeks of my life and i really havent had the chance or the feeling to post about it here..   And im not going to do it now.  If anyone wants to talk to me about it, let me know, other then that, im trying to deal with everything the best i can.    I hope all is well with everyone else...soon i hope to feel up to posting about daily occurrances as well as projects and things that im up to.  The only thing im excited about right now is Star Wars: Galaxies.  Its been a long long time since ive geeked over a computer game like this(i think it was diablo 2 with josh and maury) but then again, RPG's have a way of sucking you in.  I created a new character, been messing around with it here and there.  Havent had a chance to really spend alot of time messing with it, but thats ok, since Greg Gilbert, a fellow ITS employee plays as well, and is able to play a bit more then i am(stupid class and working till 10pm)  We just got a house today, and im working on being a smuggler so i can do slicing(hacking) and be a spice dealer(kind of like a drug dealer, but spices are drugs that are combat enhancers)  Its all pretty cool, at least to me.  Im out for now, leave some love on the chatterbox...although this whole website has seemed dead lately.  If not for the lack of new blogger templates, id change everything up to give it a new look, however i digress.  I hope all is well with everyone...take care.  *****************************************   Positive: Star Wars : Galaxies Negative: Um...yeah.

      She said she'd meet me in the bar  At the Plaza Hotel  "Wear a jacket and a tie"  "What's the occasion?"  She just smiled and she wouldn't say why  So here I am standing , waiting in the lobby  Sweating bullets in this stupid old suit  And when she sees me she busts out laughing  "You're a sad sight honey, but you look so cute" and     I don't want to be alone anymore  I was checking you out  I was just making sure  No, I don't want to be alone anymore  And, I want you tonight  Although you hurt me before  It didn't matter that I felt like a fool  'Cause I forgot when she walked through the door  I said I'm sorry, but she said it was cool  And I don't want to be alone anymore     It's so confusing choosing sides  In the heat of the moment  Just to see if it's real  It's so erotic having you  Tell me how it should feel  But I'm avoiding all the hard cold facts  That I've got to face  So ask me just one question  When this magic night is through  Could it have been just anyone  Or did it have to be you  And, will you still be saying-      I don't want to be alone anymore  I was checking you out  I was just making sure  No, I don't want to be alone anymore  And, I want you tonight  Although you hurt me before  It didn't matter that I felt like a fool  'Cause I forgot when she walked through the door  I said I'm sorry, but she said it was cool  And I don't want to be alone anymore     But, don't you know that it's wrong  It's wrong, it's wrong  But like the song  Being caught by the wink of an eye  I can't be sure we'll get along  But I'm willing to try  As long as you can tell me-     I don't want to be alone anymore  I was checking you out  I was just making sure  No, I don't want to be alone anymore  And, I want you tonight  Although you hurt me before  It didn't matter that I felt like a fool  'Cause I forgot when she walked through the door  I said I'm sorry, but she said it was cool  And I don't want to be alone anymore

      Im sure this will stir up alot of debate, but id love the discussion.   The President’s top priorities are winning the war, protecting the homeland and generating economic growth and jobs, and he has continued to lead boldly on these priorities. However, the lagging economy and weak stock market caused revenues to decline further, which explains the biggest change in the budget position, followed by the costs of the war and the economic growth plan. Although large in nominal terms, these deficits are manageable and the Administration plans to cut the deficit in half in a few years through a combination of economic growth and spending restraint. Thanks to the President delivering on a 3rd consecutive growth plan and other factors, the economy seems poised for a strong recovery.     Budget projections from the Federal Budget Submission Fiscal Year 2003      304 Billion  Fiscal Year 2004      307 Billion  Fiscal Year 2005      208 Billion  Fiscal Year 2006      201 Billion  Fiscal Year 2007     178 Billion  Fiscal Year 2008      190 Billion  At the end of Fiscal Years 2004-08 1.08 Billion    The Deficit Is Manageable. The deficit is manageable given the shocks our economy has endured (recession, terrorist attacks, revelation of corporate scandals, and a weak market). At 4.2% of GDP, it is well below the 1983 peak modern-day deficit of 6% (it’s not even in the top five). In fact, it is the same or smaller than deficits following similar recessions. These deficits are not hurting the economy right now, as interest rates are at 45-year lows.   Cut the Deficit With Economic Growth and Spending Restraint. The fundamentals – lower taxes, a positive outcome in Iraq, strong housing markets, record low interest rates, renewed consumer confidence, low inflation -- are in place for a strong recovery and job growth. Tax refund checks are on the way. A strong economy and spending restraint will cut the deficit by more than half. Economic growth creates surpluses, not the other way around.  Tax Relief is Helping the Economy Recover. Economists generally agree that the 2001 tax relief helped combat the recession, and that the latest growth and jobs package will help spark investment, recovery and job creation. Now is exactly the wrong time to raise taxes.   The Need for Spending Discipline. The President’s budget holds growth in discretionary spending below 4% (less than half the growth rate of recent years) because government spending should not grow faster than family income. In fact, spending growth outside of defense and homeland security has been slowed from 6.0% in FY02, to 4.7% in FY03, to a proposed 2.0% in FY04 (compared to a near 15% spike in FY01). The President’s budget would also re-impose spending caps and pay-as-you-go requirements to help slow spending further.  Recession, Plunging Revenues and the War – Not Tax Relief – Brought Back the Deficit.    The overwhelming reason for the change in deficit from the February projection continues to be the impact of the recession and previously weak market on tax revenues. Revenues dropped for three years in a row, which hasn’t happened in the U.S. since the 1920s. The recession and its revenue effects erased 100% of the projected FY 2002 surplus.   The response to the attacks of September 11th resulted in unanticipated but necessary spending of roughly $180B to prosecute the war on terrorism (including Operation Iraqi Freedom), build a robust homeland security system, and rebuild New York. Both parties overwhelmingly supported this additional spending.  If there had been NO TAX CUTS, not in 2001, 2002, or 2003, the budget would be in triple digit deficits today ($278B in 2003).

        PLANES!  EVERYWHERE!    Thats right, kids, its day 2 in norfolk.  This morning we got up at the buttcrack of dawn, got breakfast, then drove the 20 minutes out to virginia beach so that we could take the HRT(Hampton Roads Tranportation) exclusive tour of the Naval Air Station at Oceana, the largest NAS in the world.  We got there early, so i had time to walk around the beach in my bare feet for a while.  Such a pretty town, beautiful beach, etc etc etc.  We took the tour of the base, and got to have lunch at the officers club on the base.  Saw alot of incredible aircraft, f-14's, f/a-18's, E-6's, f-16's(why air force jets were on a naval base, well never know) and had 2 great tour guides to give us all the information.  We were able to get on the "flightline" as the military guys call it, which is the tarmac where all the aircraft are parked right by the runways.  After lunch, we went to what they call "The Petting Zoo" which is where they take 1 of every aircraft the navy has ever used and put them all in a row so people can walk up to them and see what they look like and feel like as well as get a real scale of size.  We also got bumper stickers for me and my mom that say "I (heart) Jet Noise - The Sound of FREEDOM" So funny!  Why is it funny?  Cause its true! There were full squadrons of aircraft flying around the base, i tried taking some pictures of them, but because they have the gull grey low vis paint job on them, it was impossible to get pictures to come out.  Which is the point of that paint scheme!  It was awesome.  Nothing i could write here could do it the slightest bit of justice.  Youll just have to look at the pictures on my website, which are now up for the first 2 days!   urlLink Day 1 - Downtown Norfolk and the Harbor Cruse Tour   urlLink Day 2 - Virginia Beach and Oceana Naval Air Station   I hope you all check them out!  Im having a blast here, and those pictures are a good representation of whats going on!  Tonight is going to be pretty low key, maybe go swimming, get something to eat (30 minutes inbetween of course ;-) and probably an early bedtime.  Tomorrow is the big commissioning, and we have to be there in our seats by 10 AM, however there are going to be 20,000 people there according to our tour guide on the bus today, so im thinking we need to get there alittle early.  Im sure to have plenty of awesome pictures from tomorrow, its going to be one hell of a ride.  Leave me some love in the chatterbox and let me know what you think of the pictures!  I know you all miss me ;-)  (psst, i miss you, katie!)  *****************************************   Positive: BOATS!  AND NOW PLANES!

       LIVE!  WAGS FROM NORFOLK, VIRGINIA!!   Thats right kids!  Here i am, posting in my hotel room in norfolk, va.  Im here this weekend because my family got invited to the official commissioning of the newest aircraft carrier, the U.S.S Ronald Reagan.  My family are huge military buffs.  We love to go to naval bases and keep up with all the huge hardware that the military has.  This whole thing started 5 years ago when my parents took me here to NAS Oceana and the Norfolk Naval Station as a stop on our way to DC.  We just happened to stop here the same day that they were commissioning the USS Harry Truman, the latest carrier at that time.  The president(clinton, ick) was here and the whole shebang.  That day, my mom promised to get us on the commissioning of the next carrier.  So here we are, 5 years later, and she fulfilled her promise.  She made donations to the navy league, wrote her local congresswoman, etc, and we have tickets to the commissioning on sunday.  Its going to be awesome.    The vice president is speaking, we will not only get on the aircraft carrier, but have a seat during the ceremony, and are going to an after party where lee greenwood is performing.  Its all really exciting.  For those of you who know band literature, my dad is good friends with Steve Millello(of stormworks fame) and he is writing a piece for the commissioning that the navy band is performing.  He may be coming with us if he doesnt get any passes for himself.  Its going to be such an awesome time.  Today, i drove to cleveland intl airport and flew out to norfolk.  First off, we had an avionics failure in the plane that needed to be replaced before we took off.  I met my parents in norfolk late since they were flying in from chicago, and found out they lost one of their bags.  We got to the hotel, then decided to walk around town, found someplace to eat, and then headed over to the Nauticus, the Naval Museum in downtown norfolk.  Our hotel is right downtown, so we are in walking distance of almost anything.  We went through the museum, i bought something very pretty for katie, then took a tour of the USS Wisconsin, which is a battleship that is on inactive reserve(meaning it can be sent to sea in time of a national emergency).  After that, i talked to katie(i forgot to call her and told her i got here ok cause of all the craziness at the airport) then we took the Norfolk harbor cruise, where we rode a boat all around the harbor.  From Newport News shipyard(the largest shipyard in the world, they make all the navy's ships) to the Norfolk Naval Station, we saw so much.  I took a ton of pictures, but the crazy ghetto internet here in the hotel room wont let me upload them to my website(ill get them all up once i get back, dont worry)  There are so many ships in port at NNS, 3 aircraft carriers(including the reagan and the USS Enterprise) over 20 Missile frigates/destroyers/cruisers, a handful of submarines and many supply and support ships.  For someone like me, its very very exciting.  I cant wait untill the commissioning ceremony on saturday!  Tomorrow, we are going to take a tour of the Naval Air Station Oceana then head over to Virginia Beach for some good time with the sun so im not so goddamn pasty.  Going to be a nice relaxing day.  Hope all is well with everyone else, i miss my girl, i wish she could be here!!  Hopefully more posting tomorrow night with news of what ive been up to!  *****************************************   Positive: BOATS!

       Im still alive, i promise!   Here i am, going a week without posting...bad wags, bad wags.  Heres the run down.  Last wed, i went to class, then drove home to chicago.  Spent the night doing nothing, lounging around the house with my mom and i fell asleep at 9.  Yes, 9pm.  I suck.  The next morning, i went downtown with my dad to the doctor with him, then to the new apple store. (pictures to come soon).  The store is awesome, 2 stories, one of apples new flagship stores.  For those of you following my laptop woes, they were clueless about the problems im having with it, so i opted to just buy a new hard drive for it.  Im thinking about selling it on ebay and getting a 12 inch powerbook.  I dont know, im going to wait and see if they are upgraded soon, though.  That night, Martha(the last remaining high school friend i have) and i went to Tinley Park, IL for DMB show number 3.  Pretty good set, awesome seats, terrible acoustics.  Im never going back to that venue again. Heres the setlist...  Don’t Burn The Pig  Granny  Fool To Think  One Sweet World  Pay For What You Get  Drive In Drive Out  Bartender  You Never Know  Where Are You Going  #41  Too Much  Dreaming Tree  Tripping Billies  Crash  Rapunzel  __________________   (Blue Water)  Typical Situation  (Intro)  What You Are   (song name) indicates a partial song   Full band blue water was really good.  Really exciting to see them pull that out, plus the new What You Are intro is just plain sick.  The acoustics are really just god awful there, though.  I cant even believe how bad they were.  A good thing?  I weasled my way out of the parking lot in 5 minutes, rather then an hour.  Hehehe, im so clever.  After a lovely stop at steak and shake, back home to bed.  4th of july.  Woot.  Went to watch the parade with mom to take pictures of my dads high school band.  It was the first time in a long time that i have seen the band and not been marching.  My dad has this thing where alumni can come back and march in the 4th parade, but since i had the surgery on my throat and havent played in over 2 years, i figured it wouldnt work, plus i didnt make any of the rehersals.  We had a nice cook out that night(minus the wasps) and saw the fireworks that they shot off at the country club behind my house.  I even played secret agent man(insert music) and snuck out onto the golf course with the fam and sat on the green to watch the 'works.  Good times.  On the 5th, i got up, kind of jerked around the house, did some laundry, had some lunch, etc...then Martha came at 2 to pick me up so we could drive to East Troy, Wisconsin for dmb show 4 and 5.  The drive was fun, had some funny moments, checked into our hotel and got to the show in good time.  We went to lake geneva for dinner at a place called popeyes, which was really good.  Not the fried chicken chain, this was a sit down resteraunt that was owned by a Americas Cup winner.  Pretty good...had a Gyro :-) We headed off to the show then, had a few beers in the parking lot that we took along, then headed in.  Robert Randolph and the Family Band opened, and they were smokin.  Too bad they only have 1 CD out thats a live CD with 5 tracks, cause the play some good stuff.  The concert was awesome, good set and good crowd.  Heres the setlist from that night.   Grey Street  Crush  When The World Ends  Say Goodbye  Loving Wings  Where Are You Going  What Would You Say  Angel  Ants Marching  Cry Freedom  Last Stop  The Stone  If I Had It All  Satellite  Jimi Thing  Two Step  __________________   The Maker  Rapunzel                                                     Another solid set, not a bad song in it.  Rapunzel was off the hook and ants in the middle of the set was such a throwoff.(its normally a closer for those of you non-dmb fans)  Martha and i parked about 100 yards from the exit, and it took us over an hour to get out of the damn parking lot(aka grass field).  Sucked.  However, her CRV was a trooper in making sure we kept our spot in the line.  Went back to the hotel, slept in the room that "smelt of must" and then got up the next morning to check out at noon.  Now, mind you, i knew that it was supposed to rain like mad on sunday.  How do i know such information?  BECAUSE I WATCH THE WEATHER CHANNEL.  I told martha, if its pouring, i wont want to stay at the show.  She thought that was dumb, but i stuck to my guns.  We went to this place called millies for breakfast, kinda tasty, then to find more pre show festivities beer.  Not only did we find beer, but chex mix, gum, water for after the show, and martha(being the strangest woman i know) had to have fried chicken for after the show, so we got some KFC.  Shes insane.  "Well, i had me some bacon, now fried chicken, if only i had some beef to top off my day" - Martha  We watch nasty clouds roll into ET(does gang symbol) and parked, had some beer and chicken...then it rained.  No, scratch that.  It poured.  No, scratch that.  Hurricane Tommytoughnuts came through and wrecked the world.  12 people got hit by lightning(they were all leaning on a metal fence and the fence got hit) and the lot got flooded.  It rained up untill the show started...ick.  Especially since we were on the lawn.  The people we were around were awesome, but in general, the crowd sucks on the lawn.  People there just for the scene.  Blegh.  Here was the set for that night.  Don’t Drink the Water  Rhyme & Reason  Fool To Think  One Sweet World  Song That Jane Likes  Crash  Bartender  Too Much  Dancing Nancies  Warehouse  Grace Is Gone  Help Myself  So Much To Say  Minarets  Stay   __________________ Digging a Ditch  Intro  What You Are                     Nancies into warehouse was so old school.  SMTS into minarets was incredible too.  It was a decent set, hearing 2 songs(minarets and help myself) that ive never seen live before.  Fink(marthas nickname) and i ran out to the car to try to get a head start.  We get out, drink our water and finish off the rest of our chicken, and end up finding a back way out of Alpine Valley, so instead of the 2 hours we figured it would take, it only took 20 minutes.  Drove home to chicago, got home by 1, then sleepy time.  Woke up the next morning to total ass rain storms, packed my stuff and headed back to BG.  Got here around 330, and i finally got to see katie for a small bit.  Its so good to see her, ive missed her more then words can even say.  Had dinner with the Abell family(including sister and grandparents) and played tech support guy for the whole night.  Anything to help out the family.  Since katie couldnt leave her house, i went home and got some sleep.  Got up this morning, went to fizix lab, then had "lunch" with katie.  Working 2-10 today, and damn if we didnt have the storm of jesus.  Roof blown off of the airport, off of the music building and heavy damage to the fieldhouse.  2 planes collided on the BG airport runway and a helicopter got damaged as well.  50+ trees estimated down, a tree through a window at the health center, plus other misc damage.  Pretty nasty.  2 more waves of storms coming too.  WoooooOOooOOOOoooOOoooOOo.  Good thing i get to see katie tonight, though :-)  Well, now that i just made the post of jesus, im goin to get back to work.  Hope all is well with everyone, and i hope to post the pictures of my trip up soon.  I may not post again untill next week sometime, tomorrow i have class and work all day, then thursday morning im driving to cleveland ITL arpt then flying to norfolk for the commissioning of the U.S.S Ronald Reagan, the newest aircraft carrier for the navy.  Mom has some friends in high places that got us into the ceremony and onto the ship.  Its going to be an awesome thing to see.  So ill be out untill sunday in beautiful norfolk VA, one of my favorite places in the world.  Leave me some love in EL chatterbox, and all my crazy travelling will be over soon!  *****************************************   Positive: THE GIRL IS HOME!

      Here i am....taaadaaa...   Yeah, i know nothing really going on lately.  Oh wait, not so much.  Heres a bit of a recap.  Got declined from the apple job.  Ok, shit happens, we move on.  So, i had to go full tilt to get ready for the fall semester here at BGSU.  While doing that, it was also virus hell week here at BGSU, so i was working some mad hours, during the day rather then my normal night time garbage, since there were no classes to support at night.  The week before classes started, including the saturday and sunday of move in, i worked over 55 hours.  I know, it was sick, good thing that i get paid overtime.  Do other ITS students get paid overtime?  No.  Why do i?  Beats me.  I dont know why they go the extra mile, or sometimes extra 194039472 miles for me to do things for them.  Meh, dont fight it wags.  Its funny to see how RCC is viewed not only at ITS but in the rest of the university now that im outside the organization.  I always knew that RCC and the whole organization was the butt of alot of jokes around campus, but jesus, this past week/weekend really showed me why.  Yes, i used to be in charge of the computer labs there, and i also assisted in alot of the move in operations that first week.  I have a really good idea of what went on and how things were run.  This weekend was such an eye opener for me.  Lets get one thing straight.  I appreciate everything i learned at RCC and where it got me today.  Ok, now that that disclaimer is over with....GODDAMN.  As any of you with eyes, a sense of retention and some kind of incoming news feed can attest, there were 4 major virus attacks in the past 10 days.  Thats the largest attack on this campus's infrastructure...ever.  Since i work in the university main help desk, i get to see first hand how all of these viruses(virii?) effect computers and network usage.  When MSBlast(aka lovesan) hit, i spent the whole day getting the union and tech computer labs up and running again.  Any virus that is strong enough to bring down over 50% of a universities windows XP machines is something to worry about.  Especially a worm that takes NO EFFORT on the user end to spread.  After we got that somewhat under control, we got hit with sobig.  Then Nachi.  Now Dumaru.  Now, as move in started, we had only been hit with the first 3.  The wed before exam week, we were scrambling at ITS.  We were dealing with those viruses, the blackout that hit the whole east coast/midwest and increase in network traffic.  Now, the way lovesan works is through a windows vulnerability.  Meaning users have to patch the vulnerability with a windows update to fix it.  My ex-boss at RCC told my current boss that he "wasnt concerned" with the imminent virus problem on campus and said they were ok to deal with it.  Ha.  HOW CAN YOU NOT BE CONCERNED WITH A VIRUS THAT BROUGHT DOWN THE NEW YORK TIMES NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE???? Right there, i was so mad i could spit blood.  Think about this....once students moved in, all of their brand new dells that mommy and daddy bought them that they didnt take out of the box since they got them weeks before suddenly connected to the university network..and BAM.  Infected.  Last count was over 300 infected systems.  Thats unheard of.  Yes, it could have been worse, but it was insanity to clean up.  Last count here at ITS was over 170 virus removal discs handed out for free, god knows how many people shared them.  Those were just people who DIDNT report their problem to RCC.  Not only that, but the fact that there were viruses all week when RCC was in training and nothing was done about it.  Now, i know that its difficult for them to drop training to do that, but i also know(since i made the training outline 3 years ago) that there is considerable downtime in the evening to do things like this. We got so many calls of angry people regarding network connection issues and virus problems that Toby Singer, the head of ITS called Tim King, the head of technology stuff at ResLife(and a former boss of mine before the RCC Reorg of jesus) telling him to get on the ball.  I dont know how that came about, but man.  The problem was so widespread that little freshman girls who didnt know anything about computers were calling us at ITS afraid to use the RCC connection CD because they thought it would give them the virus.  People called us asking for network connection and virus help because they said they werent getting responses from RCC.  Something needs to be done over there.  Something huge and drastic.  I dont know what, but something needs to be done.  I dont want anyone to think im badmouthing RCC.  Im not, i was just very suprised to see how this crisis, and yes it was a crisis was dealt with.  I spent 4 years of my life there working so hard for them that i couldnt see straight.  Am i bitter about how i was treated? Yes.  This has nothing to do with that, this has to deal with leadership in a time of crisis.  Character shows itself in crisis situations, and from what ive heard, it didnt impress the campus community.  This week ive been working alot and started classes.  My last semester, hopefully.  After getting the B in phys 202, hopefully i can survive calc.  The teacher is a total yatch and assigns over 40 problems of homework a night.  It sucks.  Other then that, i have a 6-9 mktg class...who needs that?  Intro to unix will be fun, 1 credit hour, hopefully learn to do more in the unix terminal in OS X, and then ECT 441.  Yes.  Dr. Kolla strikes again.  Another fun filled semester with him, but he swears(and im not making this up) that this class will be easier, have less homework, no formal lab reports and easier exams.  Well see about that.  Other then that, been playing alot of star wars galaxies, madden 04 and trying to stay personally sane, which has been more then a chore lately.  Im looking forward to a weekend of nothing.  Preseason football is over, bears were 1-3, doesnt show much, but i was happy with how the 1st string offense looked, should be a good season for them...JUST NEED TO STAY HEALTHY.  Well, hopefully ill start to post a bit more, and put a chatterbox or tag board back up.  But well see about that ;-)  *****************************************  Positive: One semester to go before im out of this place... Negative: One semester to go before im out of this place...

      Yeah...I didnt get the job with Apple in Cleveland.  Why?  Was it cause i was unqualified?  Not according to them. Was it cause i didnt interview well?  Not according to them. Was it cause i didnt fit the profile? Not according to them.  Was it cause they instead decided to fill them by transferring people internally?  Yes, yes it was.  Did they say i would have gotten it if they didnt do that?    Yes, they did.   Oh well, she said shed check into finding another position for me.  Well see...

      Hey all,   I know most of you probably dont check it, but my Mac Website has been getting some decent press lately.  The guys over at 2 guys have been real kind to me, and have made me a contributing writer as well.  Check out my Mac Website at  urlLink macevangelist.blogspot.com  and check out the 2 guys website at  urlLink www.2guysamacandawebsite.com/ .    Also, dont forget to check out my dad's new weblog, hes kind of goofy, but its fun to read!  Gets some insight into the thing that raised this crazy idiot who feels the need to ramble on on a website as well... urlLink Click if you dare!   Its looking like some major changes could be on the horizon.  Im looking to get a job with Apple Computer in a few weeks out in cleveland.  That would mean that i would leave BG one semester before im done with school, but its a price im willing to pay to work for the company ive always dreamed of working for.  It poses a few "logistical" problems to say the least, but i hope i can work through them.  Those of you who have been with my blog since day one know that day one was actually me talking about getting offered a job with Apple in New York that i had to turn down.  This seems like a ironic turn of events.  Maybe its saying that i should quit blogging, lol.  Ill post full information on what happens tomorrow at some point, im sure those of you who i talk to or see on a daily basis im sure will know the outcome, but dont worry, information will be posted here as well.    Oh, and since senseless team bashing is going on much to my  urlLink chagrin , I just have to say that the Green Bay Packers lost their preseason opener.   *grin*   *****************************************   Positive: I could be working for Apple Computer soon.

      Cris Carter sez   I understand Cleveland's dilemma. When a team drafts a quarterback with the top overall pick, it doesn't want to admit failure to establish that guy as the franchise quarterback. But right now, Kelly Holcomb is better than Tim Couch.   When a team has a quarterback controversy like this -- and loses five defensive starters without truly replacing them -- it can't expect to return to the postseason.      Good point, cris.  Good point.   He sez the following of the Steelers.  These are not the Steelers of the glory days. Gone is smashmouth football, replaced by a top-notch passing attack and, at least last season, a frustrating inability to stop the pass.   But Tommy Maddox has fit perfectly into Mike Mularkey's offensive scheme. Week in and week out, nobody comes up with better schemes than Mularkey.   Another truth.  Straight from the horses mouth kids.   Now, i try not to get all wrapped up in the team rivalry BS.  I like teams for teams.  Yes, ill always be a Bear fan, but i know when the Packers are a better team.  I never say the packers suck or anything like that, because i have respect for them as a team.  They play well, have a great QB, etc.  Sure, the Bears have won more times against them then the packers have won, but right now, Green Bay is a better team.  Well see this year, it could be a very different year for the bears.  Moral of the story, dont bash teams just cause they are a rival.  Especially when they are a better playing team.

       Well Hello There, My It's Been A Long, Long Time...   Yes, it has indeed been a long time.  Alot has happened with me, but ive had very little time to blog.  I know, extreme sadness.  Also in the category of extreme sadness, i had to deal with on of the hardest choices in my life lately.  As many of you know, i interviewed for a full time position working for apple in cleveland.  I got offered the job.  Yay!  Well, not so much.  They offered to pay little more then what i make now as a student employee.  That makes very little financial sense for me to leave school to work for apple when i wouldnt be making enough money out there to barely survive.  So, i had to turn the job down.  Honest to god one of the hardest things ive had to do in a while.  On the job front, a technology support specialist position has opened at ITS, the job ive wanted to apply to for a while now.  I went overboard and got 4 letters of reccommendation inside ITS, sent in a resume, cover letter, and reference sheet.  I REALLY hope i get this job.  REALLY.....rea....really.  On the good side, though, our Intramural Flag Football team seems to be shaping up very nicely.  We had our first scrimmage this past thursday.  We have had a few actual practices before that, but never with the whole team there.  We got there around 830, then found out that they moved it to the turf room of the field house.  So cary(from work) and i both had to drive to our respective homes and get tennis shoes rather than the cleats we had on.  We still get to the field house with time to spare, get warmed up, stretched, and took the field.  We were playing some clowns that were really cocky.  We took a quick lead, but they eventually matched it.  We played really well but had alot of bad coverage and penalties which gave the other team prime scoring opportunities.  We only lost by one touchdown, but we could have had that game if we were prepared.  Oh well, at least it was a scrimmage, not a recorded loss.  We were about to leave, and they asked us if we wanted to stay, since the 10:00 slot only had one team.  About 60% of the team stayed, which was still more then enough for us to play with.  The team we played i i found out afterwards was a ranked team.  We had alot of experience on both sides during the second game, and ended up winning.  These guys werent some random jackasses, they were ripped big guys with some real athletes on their team.  We ended up winning 14-12.  It was insane.  I got my first TD of the season there, nothing special, but it still got us the 2pt conversion we needed.  Funny part was the first play of the game, they got a 5 yard penalty because their QB didnt have flags on.  Which prompted me to ask the head ref...how can this be flag football if he doesnt have....flags.  Cause then its just..football.  He agreed and thought it was funny.  All in all, this is going to be a good time.  Look for us on the intramural fields thursday nights at 9.  You all may ask, dont you work those nights?  Yes, i do, but my boss let me take an hour off for these few weeks for "teambuilding" since most of the guys on our team are from ITS.  w00t!  To keep tabs on the flag football stuff, check out this link below.   urlLink BGSU: Student Affairs: Intramural Sports: Flag Football Home Page   I also have the first highlight film up.  Nothing real special, just some of the great plays of the first game.  Thanks to Red for taping.  Check it out on my download page off of www.brianwaggoner.com.  Click on the GRAPHITE FILE SHARING link on the top and download the file.  Thursday was Katie and my 6 month anniversary, and since today is the only real time we have together, were going to actually go out on a date for it.  Seeing as how its the 6 month milestone, i figured i should do some special things for her.  Im sure shell say something about them.  Its going to be good, kids, lol  Hope all is well with everyone.  Please let me know you read this....i havent been posting much cause i dont see much in the chatterbox.  If you read it, let me know by posting in the c-booooox!  *****************************************  Positive: Flag Football and 6 Months Negative: Who says no to their dream job?

      Well, what a weekend...  Friday i worked 8-5.  No calc since fridays are now optional.  Thats good, i guess...but i feel kind of guilty not going, then again, what do i learn IN class?  Not much.  Pretty busy at work, didnt even have a spare minute to check my email untill about 4:45, and when i did, i got the following email...   Hello, Brian!  I am emailing to let you know that we will be conducting interviews for the remaining FT and PT employment opportunities at the Legacy Village Apple Retail Store.  If you think you would be interested in talking with the management team about these opportunities, please let me know and I will be happy to schedule a time for you to meet with them on September 15th, 16th or 17th.  I hope to hear from you soon!  Sincerely, Julie Thornton Allen Apple Retail Recruiter   Yea...so another interview with apple.  This could be good and bad, but well have to see.  Im not sure what id do if i got offered a specialist or keyholder job, i guess i have to figure that out when/if i get offered.  I was going to call her back today, but alas, she was out of the office.  So exciting, but very very nervewracking.  After that, I picked up katie and met sloka and red at Hunan for some tasty chinese dinner.  From there, katie, red, fyfe, al and i drove up to novi michigan to go get red a new mac!  She got a real nice emac, good value and a nice printer.  After that, i managed to prod the apple employee about what he thinks i should do about the jobs going on.  He told me alot of things that are making me think i should really go for it.  However, like i said, well have to see.  We drove home, i set up reds computer, then came home to crash.  Saturday wasnt very exciting, i did some work around the house, took katie to get her car fixed, etc etc etc.  That night, i had dinner at the Abells and many assorted friends of katies sister.  Came home to do calc after that, but i failed miserabley...and got some sleep.  Sunday, up early to head off to Farm Aid in Columbus.  We got to leave around 11, down in columbus around 1.  Concert started at 2, heard a few iffy bands, but heard some real good ones like Brooks and Dunn, which i had never really heard before, and of course, Dave Matthews.  Dave played some older stuff as well as some stuff from his upcoming solo album, which was exciting.  All in all, we got out of there around 1230, and home around 230.    The Bears got destroyed yesterday...not even funny.  Something has to happen there.  You can bet ill be parked in front of ESPN on sunday at 8:30.  I gotta see them play.  LETS GO BEARS.  BGSU football made history on saturday, when BG beat purdue.  This is gonna be a great season.  Harris for heisman, indeed, fertel.  Well, i just had 3 classes, including my 6-9 marketing class.  I got assigned to do a spoken report on an article next monday.  Dammit...  Off to watch the rest of MNF.  I cant choose who i like more, Tampa or Philly...choices choices choices.  Leave box love.  *****************************************  Positive: Good Weekend Negative: Slightly Sunburnt Quote: "I need to calm down" - Dave Matthews - Farm Aid 03 Song of the day: Dave Matthews - So Damn Lucky Cool Mac Moment: New iPods and iMacs today.

      Back again...  Looks like thursday may be the only day i can find some time to post during the week.  The rest of the week i go from 11am-10pm with loads of calc to do later.  Not so much fun.  But i see the light at the end of the tunnel...the 3 month tunnel...  So, someone left me a very upset IM yesterday about what i had to say about RCC.  Let me clarify some things.  First off, im not at any rate minimizing the work that the students do at RCC.  Working there for 4 full years and being a supervisor for 3 of those, i know exactly how hard the students work there.  I have never seen an organization where students work as hard as RCC employees work (special cases notwithstanding) and get as little reward as they do there.  I just think that there were some managerial hiccups that could have been avoided.  I know how many viruses in res halls, because i was helping log all those with the security guys here and staying after to make sure that people could get the appropriate tools they needed as well.  I was working 8-10 hours straight as well.  Like i said, i worked over 55 hours that week, and worked 14 days straight with no break.  This is the 5th straight "IROC" that ive seen.  It was by far one of the roughest.  All i was saying was that we had 2 weeks from the break of the virus untill when students started moving in.  Something could have been done to prep for that.  Something SHOULD have been done to anticipate that.  Nothing the students should have to do, but a coordinated effort with ITS and RCC.  Ended up that ITS had to pick up alot of res hall slack when we had many many things to tend to on the faculty network side as well.  We adapted, mass made over 200 virus removal tool cd's, handed them out, made sure they were being shared as well as fixed machines with viruses in here that people would bring in.  Was that our job?  No, but we had to adapt to the situation.  All i was trying to bring up was a factor of adaptation, pre-move in, not have to deal with it AS people were moving in.  But i digress.  Its been a rough week with people this week.  I get strange feelings from alot of people im close to and people i work with.  I dont know if its the stress of the beginning of the year getting to me or what, but it just seems odd.  I dont know how to describe it.  Its hard because i rarely see anyone.  I spend 11 hours a day straight on campus, then come home to do a boatload of calc then go to bed.  Wake up at 930, go to work at 11 and it repeats itself.  Who knows.  I guess im just feeling detached from reality.  Maybe im really looking forward to starting something new.  New job, moving somewhere new, just getting a change.  Im the kind of person who needs some kind of change every once in a while, and im to the point where i need some kind of change again.  I dont know what, im sure ill know when i see it, but something has to change....  Job market is grim.  I applied for 2 computer jobs at OSU, 3 jobs with Nextel in VA, some other random tech jobs here and there all around the midwest/east coast.  I keep calling the lady at apple back, she doesnt return my calls, thats not a good sign.  Who knows.  Rumor has it a TSS job will be open here at ITS soon since the PC image guy left and moved to florida.  But do i want to stay here in BG and work for ITS full time?  I dont know.  I dont know what to do.  Im looking for what to do with the rest of my life, but its hard, because so much is in flux.  *heavy sigh*  Mission for you blog readers.  Think about where you were 2 years ago.  4 years ago.  Think about how far youve come.  Its kind of scary.  ITS intermural football league is starting soon.  McComas, Me, Mike Good, Gebby, Cary and a bunch of guys from ITS and friends of ITSers are gonna rip up the rec league.  Should be fun and interesting to see.  Get my ass on that field.  See whats gonna happen.  Well, leave some love in the box, kids.  Watch out for dem hoes.  *****************************************  Positive: 2 Weeks down Negative: 15+ to go Quote: "Can i just tell her.."Sorry, no tools allowed on this team?"  Can I?" - McComas Song of the day: John Mayer - Homelife Cool Mac Moment: New version of backup 2.0 is awesome.  Finally i can backup to network drives!

      Christ, sloka has posted more than i have lately....   Stupid 40 hours of work a week...stupid full class load....stupid trying to graduate in december...stupid trying to find a job....stupid.....a;lsdkhfla..  Its been really stressfull lately, and i havent had a chance to update.  No, scratch that, ive had the time, but ive spent it trying to regain my sanity.  Every day for me is at least 11 hours long with no break(11am to 10pm) and when i get home, the last thing i want to do is recap all the shit i did that day.  As my time at BG is winding down, ive been focusing on my future, trying to figure out what the right thing to do is.  Career, personal life, etc.  I guess i just dont know.  Too many uncertainties.  I am very happy though that i have been out on my own, having to pay my own bills, live on my own, take care of myself, etc so i have that level of maturity.  I know alot of people who dont have that sort of mental attitude, and real life is gonna be a big shock when it hits them.  Big thing on my plate right now?  Interview with crowe chizek.  Check them out at www.crowechizek.com  This could be a real good job, id be doing IT consulting, doing alot of travelling and alot of cool tech work.  I want this job soooooo badly.  I interviewed with them a few weeks ago, and almost immediately got offered an on site interview in their headquarters in south bend.  Im going out the 13th of November(lucky 13) for 2 days, they are paying for me to travel and stay out there as well as interviews, meetings...and a 20 minute all or nothing interview with an "Executive".  *holy nervous*  I think i should do ok.  Ive had more job interviews in my life than almost any other college student i know.  My resume rocks and i have GREAT interviewing skills.  Is that cocky?  Maybe, but its all i got...so let me be.  New season of 24....so good, so good...  Other than that...same shit is on my mind...dont know what i should do with anything...anyone have any bright ideas?  Let me know....

       Hes Alive!   Yes, I know again its been a long time since ive posted, but man my life has been busy lately.  Working full time and being a full tiem student at the same time can be a real bear.  Im  so ready for that whole thing to be over with.  Got some job interviews as of late, things are looking good for a december graduation date.  All i have to do is pass calc, and that could be a chore.  However, my teacher said i can do it.  So lets see what happens.  Some new cool things came out from apple.  iTunes for windows came out today, so all you windoze users who said they wish they had itunes can now use it.  Good for you all...one step closer!  Have had alot of heavy stuff on my mind lately, havent talked to anyone about it, but its been that time of the year.  Trying to figure out what i want to do with the rest of my life, where i want to start it, what i will and wont do or will or wont go, making sure im doing what i want to do rather than what someone else wants me to do or what someone else wants to do.  Its hard.  Trying to get started is hard enough, but making sure that start is the right one for the rest of your life is definately one of the hardest things to ever do.  Flag football tonite.  Playin sig ep's C team.  Should be a good game.  I read some good quotes in my cousins profile that bear posting.   People are lonely because they build walls instead of bridges.  Every person, all the events of your life are there because you have drawn them there. What you choose to do with them is up to you.  Don't settle for the one you can live with, wait for the one you can't live without.    Thanks les.  Im audi.

      SATUDAY FOOTBALL PICKS!  So i was 10-6 last week, not too bad, if i do say so myself.  However this week, Fertel and i are going head to head on the picks.  Here are mine.  Panthers Vs Cowboys - Will be tough.  Im going to give the edge to the panthers, having played better teams so far.  While i want parcells to win, i think the cowboys have been too lucky this season.  If they win, they will be for real, otherwise, i think its been luck  Lions Vs Vikings - look for the vikings to spring back this week.  Colts vs Bills - Colts to win  Jaguars vs. Jets - hard to say, would like to see leftwich do well, but the battle of marshall QBs will prolly end in a jets win.  Pats vs Texans - battle of red white and blue.  Goes to Patriots.  Eagles Vs Saints - Eagles on a row.  Mcnabb is back.  Browns vs Steelers - while i hate to say it, its going to be the browns.  Steelers need to kill this slump. How great would it be to do it against the browns?  Seahawks vs Ravens - good matchup.  Good seattle offense vs good ravens defense.  i think the defense will be too good for seattle and hold them to a loss.  49ers vs Packers - battle of lost potiential.  Green bay should win if they keep themselves together.  Bears vs Broncos - Broncos.  *tear*  Rams vs Cards - Rams.  Hands Down.  Raiders vs Chiefs - id say chiefs hands down, but the bengals rocked em last week.  The raiders are still a shadow of their former selves, and chiefs will bounce back to win this one.  Bengals Vs Chargers - bengals.  Will win their division too.  Titans Vs Falcons - Titans.  Go mcnair  Skins vs Dolphins - Dolphins to get some momentum now.  Giants Vs Bucs - I cant believe the bucs now.  What they did to keyshaun is so stupid.  Barber boys will play well, but bucs will win.   There ya go, have a good sunday NFL day!

      SATURDAY FOOTBALL PICKS!  Ill make this short and sweet.  Browns over Cardinals - Browns need to rebound after last week.  Cards dont pose much of a threat for browns. Saints over Falcons - Vick is back in practice.  Ok, but that wont save a team with 2 wins. Ravens over Dolphins - Ricky vs Jamal, will be battle of the run defense.  Ray lewis at the helm, Ravens have the lead on this one. Bills over Texans - Bills can rebound from last week.  Will be a pretty ugly game. Titans over Jaguars - Titans are on a roll, keep it comin.  Id love to see leftwich do well, though... Chiefs over Bengals - COME ON.  If you are the chad johnson going against a 9-0 team, dont guarantee a win.  Jeez Eagles over Giants - Eagles are back on track.  No shockey?  Who cares. Rams over Bears(i know, i know...) - Rams are too good.  Bears are too bad.  I still love my bears, though. Panthers over Skins - Most people didnt know carolina had a football team, let alone a winning team. Colts over Jets - Peyton will bring it home with all the tools at his disposal.  No repeat of the 41-0 loss in the playoffs last year. Broncos over Chargers - Last week was a fluke for flutie.  Broncos will win.  PLUMMER IS BACK! Seahawks over Lions - Hawks at home.  Hawks win. Packers over Buccaneers - Bucks aint what they used to be.  Only thing they might have are GB turnovers, but the GB offence is in sync. Vikings over Raiders - Vikings will be focused and ready to spring back after their 4 game losing streak. Cowbows over Patriots - Low scoring defensive game.  Parcells will do it.  Hes incredible.  Monday -  Steelers over 49ers - Steelers are back on a roll...cmon pitt!  6-7 In picks last week, lets see how i do this week!  Tell me what you think in the chatterbox!

      Hello again!  Again, sorry for the posting delay, but this has been an extrordinarily busy week.  Calc exam, preparation for the job interview im going on for today and tomorrow...its been tough.  However, i wanted to give the recap on the NFL picks i did as well as the Bears v. Lions game i attended.  Cardinals V. Steelers I actually picked well for this game.  I knew the steelers had it in them to come back and get a win.  Lets hope they can keep it up for the rest of the season.  Falcons vs. Giants Alright, my bad here.  Who would have thought the Falcons could win this game.  Good for them, but also good that vick started practicing again yesterday!  Browns vs. Chiefs I figured it would be a shut out, i was wrong.  However, i knew the chiefs would go 9-0.  My boss picked the Browns.  I dont get him sometimes.  Texans vs. Bengals Right again.  Kinda wish i could have seen the game though.  Colts vs. Jags Uh.  jaguars beat Colts?  Noone saw that coming  Dolphins vs. Titans Tennesee shut out the Dolphins.  Right.  What a week for upsets.  Good god, though.  Steve McNair is a god. Another wrong pick for me  Seahawks vs. Redskins Another bad pick.  I didnt see spurrier as having that good of a team.  BUT, Hawks suck on the road.  Should have seen that.  Bucs vs. Panthers Well, the bucs didnt win this.  So they dont deserve to go to the playoffs.  What an upset.  Vikings vs. Chargers AGAIN with the upset.  I cant believe that the CHARGERS, the team the bears blasted last week beat the vikings.  Wow.  Bills vs. Cowboys Atta boy parcells and crew.  Way to keep bledsoe in check.  Dallas at 7-2.  Wow.  Jets vs. Raiders Picked a winner in an OT terrible game here.  Go raiders.  Go HOME.  Ravens vs. Rams Rams win.  Now, on like 100 yds of offense?  What a game of turnovers.  man.  Bears v Lions. Anyone who saw this game knows what im going to say.  Lions win by a joke field goal with 30 seconds left in the game.  Terrible.  Nice stadium, nice fans.  Thats all im gonna say.   So i was 6-7.  not bad with all the crazy upsets this week.  Ill try to do another pick set this week.   Other than that, im heading to south bend for 2 days for an onsite interview with Crowe Chizek.  They are an accounting/consulting firm that are interviewing me to work in thier IT Risk Management department.  Gonna be a very very cool thing if it would work.  Ill be sure to keep you all posted here on my job status if it changes this weekend!

       SATRUDAY FOOTBALL PICKS!   As most of you know, im a huge NFL junkie.  So i thought id put that to good use, and take the weekend to make my predictions for sundays games.  Here are my picks to win sundays NFL games.   Cardinals V. Steelers  I think im going to have to go with the steelers on this one.  I know they havent really been playing that well this year, but they do have alot of potential.  All Arizona has is....a has been running back and a bunch of other mediocre players.  Plus, being at Heinz Field should give the steelers a slight boost coming into this game.     Falcons vs. Giants  No contest here.  No Vick, no Falcons.  Im not saying that Vick is the only thing that the falcons have, but without him, they havent been playing well all season.  It may not be his athletic ability but his leadership this team has been lacking since the preseason.  The giants arent knocking my socks off, but Kerry Collins and Jeremy Shockey are a pair that are hard to beat.   Browns vs. Chiefs  Sorry browns fans, you arent gonna be enough to hand the only unbeaten team left in the league their first loss.  Sorry, just not gonna happen.  Ill eat my words if it does, but it doesnt look likely.   Texans vs. Bengals  This could be one of the more interesting games.  Marvin Lewis has done some good things to the bengals, but the texans are about at the same point.  They need something big to happen to rally the team so that they can play better.  I wish i could catch this game, it seems like it could be a matchup, but i think im gonna give the bengals the small edge on this one.   Colts vs. Jags  Colts.  Playing so well this year, they really are coming together as a team.  Jags got ALOT of work to do.   Dolphins vs. Titans  Dolphins need a win here and i think they are gonna get one.  They play well, but i think there is too much crap off the field with these 2 teams.  Plus, they rely on ricky williams too much to run the ball for them while not spreading it around the field.  However, the titans arent much.  But lets hope mcnair has a good game for all you fantasy players out there.   Seahawks vs. Redskins  Hawks.  Playing REAL well this year, not stellar, but enough to get them to the postseason i think.  Redskins arent terrible, but arent great.  I dont see them really shining this year.  I dont know if spurrier is still adjusting to coaching in the NFL or what, but something isnt gelling with that team.   Bucs vs. Panthers  If the bucs dont win this, they dont deserve to go to the playoffs.  Thats all im saying on this game.   Vikings vs. Chargers  See above post for thoughts on what the Vikings need to do.   Bills vs. Cowboys  Cowboys.  Parcells is a god among men.  I odnt know how he does this with teams, but man the cowboys look good.  Maybe the bears should hire him, lol.  nah, but seriously, this Dallas team looks great this year for such a turnaround.  I hope they do well, i really do.   Jets vs. Raiders  Battle of the dissapointing teams this year.  Ill go with the jets just because of all the drama in oakland with woodson talking about all the problems and team infighting.  Raiders.  Wow.  Werent you in the super bowl last year?  Fooled me.   Ravens vs. Rams  2 of the top teams in the league.  It will be interesting to see if the rams can keep up their streak or if they are just lucky so far.  I think im going to pick the rams on this one, because they are an all around good team.  Id love to see the ravens do well since they have potential, but it will have to be seen.  Ill leave the monday night game untill sunday night.  However, the game of the week for me?   BEARS vs. LIONS  Yes, folks.  The bears could hit a 3 game winning streak.  Lets hope they turn it around.  Away from home and in detroit, this could be interesting.  They played the lions 2 weeks ago and beat them, so this could be an easy game for them.  What will make it better?  ILL BE THERE.  Expect a full recap of the events when i get back!  GET YOUR GAME FACES ON, FOOTBALL FANS!!!!

      Climbing up on solsbury hill I could see the city light Wind was blowing, time stood still Eagle flew out of the night  He was something to observe Came in close, I heard a voice Standing stretching every nerve I had to listen had no choice  I did not believe the information Just had to trust imagination My heart was going boom boom, boom Son, he said, grab your things, I’ve come to take you home.  To keeping silence I resigned My friends would think I was a nut Turning water into wine Open doors would soon be shut  So I went from day to day Tho’ my life was in a rut ’till I thought of what I’d say Which connection I should cut  I was feeling part of the scenery I walked right out of the machinery My heart was going boom boom boom Hey, he said, grab your things, I’ve come to take you home. Yeah back home  When illusion spin her net I’m never where I want to be And liberty she pirouette When I think that I am free  Watched by empty silhouettes Who close their eyes, but still can see No one taught them etiquette I will show another me  Today I don’t need a replacement I’ll tell them what the smile on my face meant My heart was going boom boom boom Hey, I said, you can keep my things, they’ve come to take me home.

      Sometimes I wake with a weary head and I wonder how I'll ever get through Then I think of the things you said how you told me to my self be true My faith in things unseen, My belief that it'll all work out May seem like a strange cup of tea, but if its all right with you than it all  Right with me   Oh my feet I walk, with my legs I run In my arms I'll hold another day With my head I think, from my heart I sing And with my hand to my face I pray   There's times I feel with the stains of life  I could just turn around, turn around walk away  Then a strength like a beam from above  lifts me up by the hand and it leads me to say Good things for good people you see good things they seem to all work out May seem like a strange cup of tea but if its all right with you well then its all right with me   Oh my feet I walk, with my legs I run In my arms I'll hold another day With my head I think, from my heart I sing And with my hand to my face I pray   Getting by ain't enough for me I know what I like I like what I see I'm not only flesh and blood but  I'm heart and soul I know   Sometimes I feel at the end of the day was it worth while or have I settled for less I sit back and your there by my side sincerely you say,  we're both so blessed Count your blessing count them one, two, three  don't give up cause it'll all work out  It may seem like a strange cup of tea but if it's all right with you, it's just fine with me   Oh my feet I walk, with my legs I run In my arms I'll hoild another day With my head I think, from my heart I sing And with my hand to my face I pray

      Its been a pretty wild day.  Nutty stuff at work, bleeding everywhere from a gash i got from callie, slipping on ice outside tgi fridays(thanks for the bad karma, morgan) and messing up my ankle and knee among other things.  I gotta tell you guys, ive always been a sister hazel fan, but lately, they have been growing on me more and more.  I just got their new live CD "Live, LIve" which is awesome.  Most people know them from their radio hits, which are awesome, but the rest of thier stuff is awesome.  They are one of the most consistantly good bands ive ever heard.  Thier first live DVD just came out too, called "A Life In The Day" which has a hilarous documentary about their travels all over the nation, their concerts, the rock boat cruise they started a few years ago, and all the great stuff they do with their fan base.  I love the fact that they are popular enough to get good billing, tour enough, but not have huge ampitheatre crowds and enough time to still do everything they can to meet and talk to their fans.  Ive made a decision that im going to The Rock Boat this year, since they head it up, and other bands i love are playing as well.  This year, Pat McGee Band, Edwin McCain and Will Hoge are going on the cruise with a bunch more bands to be announced.  Last year, among those, Virginia Coalition played.  Wow.  4 days on a cruise in the carribean with these bands....like Ken Block said in the documentary on the DVD, "Its like spring break for people with jobs!".  Im gonna go head off to bed, hopefully not get scratched by callie again tonite and not fall on my ass again tomorrow at work.  Good news is that my mom and missy are coming out tomorrow night to spend some time out here, and they are going to help me get a couch and coffee table! FINALLY!  In other news, everything is now unpacked an in some sort of arranged sort here.  I finally went through, created a bill filing system, as well as seriously put in hanging files in my filing cabinet.  Is this something worthy of blogging?  Not for most of you, but before, i could fit all my critical information(bills, statements, pay stubs, etc) in an accordion folder...but when i started to do that here....it got too big to close.  So, looks like i had to upgrade to adult filing. Especially with my big kid moment of the day, i got my own car insurance starting in 45 minutes!  Its so wierd to have all these bills to myself.  Im just glad i have a good paying job to help me with it.  Also, ive gotten a new email address for everyone to use.  I figure i have it, so i might as well start using it, and start phasing out all my other ones, since this one aint goin nowhere.  Brian@BrianWaggoner.com  is it for you all.  Send me love!    Hope all is well for everyone else, but if i seriously see one more away message about BG not cancelling school because of snow, im gonna start shooting.  The weatherman JUST SAID that in the last 48 hours, we have gotten between 12-20 inches of snow over michiana(the wierd ass term they call the northern part of indiana and southern michigan, apparently its not enough for indiana to have their own wacky ass time zone, they want to have a new state or something.  I really dont get it.  I digress).  So yeah.  No complaining.  Its not that BG "doesnt care about your safety" or that "they dont think before making a decision" its more along the lines of....you are adults now, and can decide if your safety is really at stake and if its worth risking your safety to go to class.  In my 4.5 years at BG, not ONCE did a teacher not sympathize with a commuter because of a short term(less than a few days) weather issue, and i saw some students abuse it.  So RELAX ABOUT THE STUPID SNOW DAY.  Ok, im done.  Good night.   *whistles to callie to tell her to come to bed*

       Of Snow, Peanuts, Cabinets, videochats, hacking and Indian food...    I know it has been a long time since I have posted, but im hoping to change that.  Alot of stuff has happened since the last post(s), and Im going to do my best to break it down(chicka wooow-wooowww) for you.  So here goes!   Im sitting here posting from South Bend, Indiana at my desk, on an IBM thinkpad eating peanuts and preparing for an exit meeting.    What?  I think im getting ahead of myself.  A person said to me once, "Dont grow up all at once, else youll lose all the fun."  I tried to live by that motto, slowly easing myself into adulthood and responsibility.  Well, arguably a few of the most important things in my life have happened within the past month.  So much for all at once.  On paper, it looks like i grew up extremely fast, but to me, its been a smooth transition.  Its true.  I passed calculus(got a c with the grace of god and jimmy lesko) and therefore graduated from Bowling Green State University with an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Computer Technology.  What should i do with this degree?  Honestly, stuff i hate.  Circuit design, mechanical electronics, manufacturing systems, etc.  To that, i said...no thanks.  I focused on network security, hardware, network administration.  No degree program at BGSU really focuses on any of those areas, so i took as many classes as i could as well as did internships with those topics.  Having a resume that rivals people 10 years older than me, I started looking for jobs.    While I had many prospects, and in retrospect, a few offers, one of them really stood out from the crowd.  My number one pick was an Information Security Consultant position with Crowe Chizek, an accounting and consulting firm.  Ive known the name for a while, seeing as how they have had a major office 5 minutes north of my parents house for as long as I can remember, i talked to them at the BGSU job fair.  Not thinking i had much of a chance because of my background, i went in with a "nothing to lose" attitude.  I gave them my resume, expected that to be it.    A few days later i was asked to do an interview on campus with their representatives.  I met with 2 people from their Information Risk Management group, and had the same sort of attitude.  I figured they were looking for people with much higher GPA's than myself, internships with the big 4 consulting/accounting firms and other huge professional accolades.  Now, my credentials are good, but i didnt think they were in the niche they were looking for.  After meeting with both interviewers, I was very interested in their position.  Its part james bond, part hacker.  Take the movie  Sneakers  and mix it with the movie  Hackers .  Thats the job.  Testing network security, doing external penetration tests (a.k.a. Hacking) and doing internal penetration tests(a.k.a. lying to people about who you are to get critical informationby way of social engineering).  I figured i had a decent interview and would get a thank you note in the mail, but nothing else.    Around 5pm, i got a call asking me to come to their headquarters in south bend, IN for an on site office visit.  They were very impressed with me and my interview, and brought me out to south bend in mid november.  I visited for 2 days, met with everyone, interviewed with the partners(one of which is a BGSU graduate) and then played the waiting game.  In the end, the thursday of exam week....i got my offer call from the partner.  I accepted, and had to find a place to live within 2 weeks, with christmas and new years sitting square in the middle of those 2 weeks.  I took a trip out here to south bend with katie, i found a nice place to live, moved in and got settled in to start work on the 5th of january.  South Bend gets a boatload of snow, since we are in a lake effect snow zone, and the first night i lived here, we got 4-5 inches.  Since moving in, ive been working here, loving every minute of it, and letting people know all the cool stuff i do(that i can talk about because of security reasons and confidentiality agreements).  I was able to get my own cat, a black domestic short hair named Callie who is one of the most interesting animals i have met.  She loves to open and close all cabinets in the apartment.  Shes a good cat, very affectionate, even when im in the middle of things.  The people i work with are very interesting.  We all have drastically different backgrounds.  Everyone eats different things, does different stuff, knows different topics.  One of the crew's favorite places to eat is an indian resteraunt that i didnt really care for ;-) but its good to try different things.  I spoiled myself a bit since i got a good job with a great salary, bought myself some neat toys.  The best is probably my iSight camera that i got so that i can still see and talk to Katie and my parents from the comfort of my Mac.  Its great, makes phones useless.  If anyone has a mac with iChat AV, i suggest getting one of these.  It will change the way you communicate.  Starting today, im going back on the Atkins diet.  I was very successful with it before and hope to repeat that performance this time.  Being back on a somewhat 8-5 schedule is easier for that, rather than working/class everyday from 11-10pm.  I really want to get my health in order.  I figure thats a good way to get started while i wait for the dietician from St. Joes Med Center to call me back.  I have definately learned alot in a month.  Relationships have changed, people have changed, i have changed.  I try to keep in touch with my friends, and have been dissapointed with some people doing what they can to screw me over.  Its sad to see some people become everything they hated about someone else, but there is nothing i can do.  Things are definately hard on the relationship front being 2.5 hours away from Bowling Green, but anything is possible.  People never cease to suprise me, but they also never cease to amaze me.  Be looking for more updates soon.  I promise im going to keep up on it, since i cant talk to everyone id like to, but im sure trying!  For those of you who i didnt send the information to(did ya get that memo?) I have new contact information.  Email me at bjwaggoner@mac.com for it!

      Well, ive been waiting for alot of things to die down before posting about this.  But i think now its a good time to put it up here for all my friends who dont know to see.  I got engaged!  Yes, its true.  I proposed to Katie this past weekend when she came out for valentines day.  This is a very happy time for us, there were a few "logistical issues", but now it all seems to be working out fine.  I just want to say how much i love her and how i wouldnt be the person i am if it werent for her.  She has really changed my life from one of the darkest points i was ever in, and has made it the brightest it has ever been.  She has made me a better person, and for that i love her and thank her.  Ok.  I had to get that out of my system.  Work has been going pretty well, ive been learning more and more every day.  Next week, i am travelling again, but this time to a way more exotic place than monmouth, IL.  Im heading to Houston, TX for a week to do a network security assesment for a bank.  Its going to be sooooo haaaard! ;-)  Highs in the low seventies all week...sun....people with a texas accent...i dont know how im going to handle it.  LoL.  Seriously, im really excited about this.  Its a type of job i have never done before, and its travelling.  Minus the layover in cleveland, this hopefully will be a very enjoyable time.  I hope all of you are doing well, im starting a new creative outlet for me.  As many of you know, im a Madden 2004 junkie, and while driving to and from BG today, i thought of creating my own online pseudo-news site for it.  Check it out  urlLink here!   Leave some chatterbox love!

      Well here I am, back to posting again.  Its been a few days, but here is a recap of what I’ve been doing.  I’ve been involved in some external penetration tests at Crowe.  What that really means is we get authorization from companies to try to hack their network.  We get no information from them on what system names they have or anything, we take the position of a hacker, try to gather information using public sources, and then attempt to compromise them.  We will do social engineering, which is a nice way of saying, “lie to someone to get what you want.”  Doing whatever we can, we try to obtain usernames and passwords of the client’s employees.  It’s pretty fun.  I dig it, but after a while, you start to feel bad about lying to people, but then again, once you PWNZ0R a major financial institutions network, you feel good.  Last week, I was at a client for my first time traveling in the job.  We were doing a GLBA assessment, which was a congressional act that was passed to ensure banks keeping the safety of customer information.  Its 3 days of interviewing people asking about network security, physical security, etc about the banks customer information.  Its nice to get out of the office, do a new type of assessment.  But my first location for travel…. Monmouth, Illinois.  MONMOUTH.  Its 20 miles from Western Illinois University, in the ARMPIT of western Illinois.  It wasn’t that bad, but definitely different.  Very small town, very Midwest.  The closest city was the “quad cities” of Moline, Rock Island (both in IL) and Bettendorf and Davenport IA.  Not terrible, but its no Chicago.  The next client I get to travel to is going to be close to Cleveland, so that should be better.  This week im back in south bend, which will be nice after traveling.  Valentines day is coming up this weekend, and I have to start preparing for spoiling my girlfriend.  *wonders what to do*  Email me suggestions @ brian@brianwaggoner.com  I have to tell everyone, this not having to work at night thing is pretty awesome.  There is so much TV I can finally watch.  I really do have shows every night.  It’s SO BAD.  Monday: My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancée, CSI: Miami Tuesday: American Idol, 24(GOLDEN GLOBE WINNER, WOOO) Wednesday: American Idol (if its on), West Wing, Law And Order Thursday: CSI, Without A Trace  Friday – Sunday ill watch whatever Law and Order spin-offs are on whenever they are on.  This is so bad, I feel like that statistic they all talk about who watches way too much TV.  I really suck.  I put some new pictures of the cat up on my website.  Just go to www.brianwaggoner.com and click on the links at the top.  I also put up some audio captures of 3 new pat mcgee band songs.  They are pretty bad ass, let me know what you think.  Hope all is well with everyone.  Let me know what’s up!

      Hello all!  I just returned from a week in Oswego, New York.  Its about 45 minutes north of Syracuse, on Lake Ontario.  It was nice, a GLB Assessment with Ryan Roling, who i never worked with before.  Hes a great guy, and we did a bang up job for the client.    The weather was mostly trash out there, upstate New York seems to always be cold.  Thursday, it got above 50 degrees, and idiots were running around with shorts and t-shirts from SUNY-Oswego.  The best part of the trip was the fact that Ryan and i got stopped twice while out and about in our suits and people asked us if we were with the FBI.  Ryan still had the best answer for that.."Im not sure i can tell you".  It was great.  Things are going well at Crowe.  There are some good opportunities for me on the horizon and im still doing everything i can to help me be able to move to Columbus around the same time Katie goes out there to go to OSU for grad school this fall.    Also, last week, some idiot decided to break into my car during the night, and tore the dash apart, stole the stereo out of it, smashed the drivers door window and did a ton of other damage.  I spent a few days trying to get it taken care of, but instead decided it wasnt worth the money or time, and bought a new car.  I got a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox.  They are very cool, and very affordable.  You can check them out at  urlLink  .  I havent had much time to drive it, but it rides like a dream, i fit great in it(even my monkey legs) and i got a sweet deal on it.  I spent last weekend with katie's extended family for easter.  It was interesting to say the least.  All in all, a good time was had, including the drive back from cleveland to take her dad home to BG with their dog Myles in the backseat.  What a weekend....although, the lamb cake turned out extemely well if i do say so myself.  Tomorrow (since i dont travel enough) im driving out to Bowling Green to go to the Tau Beta Sigma formal with Katie.  Im making dinner for the group we are going with, that should be interesting.  Heres to making something that doesnt suck.  Time for some Tony Bennett and Bed.  6 hours of travel today wore me out big time.  Talk to you all soon!

      Long time no see.  I hate to apologize ever time i post again, but this past month has been insane.  First off, theres work.  Work has been great.  Im learning tons, going to alot of great places such as Houston, TX, Lexington, Kentucky and soon, New York, Tennesee, Michigan, etc.  Lexington was a definate change for me.  I spent 4 weeks there doing work for Lexmark -  urlLink  .  It was a long 4 weeks, but i met alot of great people, and did work ive never done before.  It was great.  My team was awesome and we had a great time.  4 weeks, though is definately a long time to be away from home.  All in all, it was a great experience, but im sure glad to be home for a while.  Im starting to feel much older.  People always told me i act much older than my age, but im really starting to feel it now.  I dont know how it will affect me, maybe good, maybe bad.  But i do know that im changing.  Attitude, outlook, etc.    Oh well.  Living on my own out here has its good and bad points.  I cant tell you how much i love living in my OWN APARTMENT, especially after my last string of roommates.  However, it would be nice if i had some people to spend time with that are closer than 2 or 3 hours away.  Thats the biggest down side.  My family is 2 hours away and my friends are close to 3 hours away.  It tends for some lonley nights and weekends.  Ive been trying to keep tabs on politics as usual, which is what sparked my title for this entry.  It means in latin "In Time of War, Law is silent".  Im getting kind of worn out of the bickering.  I know its early, but jesus.  Its going to be a long trek to november.  Hope all is well with everyone, leave me some love.

      So, as a slight caveat, i tried posting this last night, but the wireless connection in my hotel has been pretty goofy.  So here goes.  Hope this finds everyone doing well.  Again, ive been travelling like mad, spent 2 weeks in columbus doing some work.  Things were going very well.  I met some new people from IRM, worked with some existing people i have a great relationship, got to see Tom(a friend/fellow intern from AEP) and spend 2 weeks in one of my favorite cities in the world.  Columbus.  Im also about 99% sure that as of october 1, ill be transferring to the columbus office.  I cant even put into words how excited i am.  Katie will be down there working on her grad school things, ill be down in columbus, we finally wont have to travel over 2 hours one way to see each other.  Itll definately be good....especially since we need to start planning a wedding soon ;-)  So all in all, things in columbus were going well....     Then i got reassigned to a client i worked on before. However, the good part of the deal was i didnt have to actually go on site for this job.  Working out of the clevleand office for the next few weeks, which is nice since i actually have a good network connection to get work done and cleveland is a decent city. Working with Paul is a riot again.  The only Senior Manager in our group who will sing to me, then burp, then sing again while we are working.  What a character.  I thought the work was only going to go about 2 weeks, but now its looking like closer to the middle of june.  Middle of june, hmm...sounds like me birthday time  w00t0rz.  Turning 23 on june 8.  Whaaaa...when did i get so old. *sucks*  Katie leaves for her field camp trip next week.  It *should* be easier to deal with this year since ill be alot busier, and im used to going weeks at a time without seeing her.  However, going without talking to her either on IM or on the phone will be a chore.  Well get through it, we always do.  Callie is getting declawed in the next few weeks.  It will sure be nice to have a lap cat that doesnt cut me up 6 ways to sunday.  From there, she will most likely be going to spend some time with my mom untill my travel schedule dies down a bit.  Hopefully ill spend alittle time in the office in august to prep for my move.  Time to start looking for a place to live in columbus.  Yay :-)  On a sad note, everyone please pray for Al.  Her mother just passed away, and shes going through a real rough time.  Shes a great gal, and deserves the best.  Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers.  On a happy note, im now a contributing writer to www.ipodgarage.com and soon to www.billpalmer.net.  Bill has brought me on as a writer, i dont know what he was thinking.  Finally i can have a place to write about Apple stuff without the hassle of running my own website.  Those of you with ipods should really check out ipodgarage.com.  We have some good info on there, good ads for you to check out, and some sweet forums to participate in.  Let me know if you want any info.   Hope all is well, im really trying to post more regularly.  But when i have a choice between  urlLink star wars galaxies  or blogging....those of you who know me know what im going to choose.    Take care all.

      Hello all -   Just got back from another week of fun.  I spent the past week doing an internal penetration assessment for a bank in ohio.  It was pretty fun, very secret agenty, very spy-esque.  Learned alot, had a good time.  Went to another formal this past weekend, went to the SAI/PMA formal.  Saw alot of good friends this weekend and had some very good times.  There are some funny pictures on katies website, http://homepage.mac.com/katieabell  Check em out.  Heading out tomorow to columbus for 4 month job there.  I love columbus, so it should be great.  Spending every week away from home, now thats another thing.  Although, things are looking good for my eventual transfer to the columbus office with Crowe.  More news on that hopefully soon.  Hope all is well with everyone, send me a note, bjwaggoner@mac.com.  Take care.

      Its been a decent amount of time since i posted last, ive been travelling almost every week for the past 6-8 weeks and when im not travelling, im swamped with work/doing things i need to do at home.  There was a period of time where in 7 days i was in 6 DIFFERENT states.  I left dallas on friday, flew to chicago, then to south bend, then off to columbus for a few days, then drove to pittsburgh by way of west virginia.  Its been kind of nutty, let me get to the story telling.  Ive been doing some pretty neat work(of which i cannot discuss where/when/what because of new policies in our department) and been gaining some great experience.  Travelling is getting pretty old.  At first, it was neat to be able to see some different parts of the country.  Since ive been with crowe, ive gone everywhere from small farm towns in western illinois, to dallas, texas, to my current job in the chicago area, to a little town south of houston, new york, columbus, eastern ohio and other places.  Its been interesting, but living out of a suitcase gets kind of old.  Its also really easy to feel like you dont accomplish anything in the line of work that i am in, seeing as we come in sunday night/monday morning, work through the week, look for any sort of findings, present our findings on thursday or friday, then head off and repeat the next week.  I guess im finding out that i like to be more of a problem solver than problem finder.  The long term job ive been on and off of in columbus/dallas has been pretty nice because we get to create relationships with people and work with them to solve problems.  Its not a fly by night sort of thing, remediation of their issues is what is starting to be more fulfilling to me.  Consulting takes a definate mindset.  You cant get frustrated easily, you cant mind living on the road 5 nights a week and you cant mind nearly living with your coworkers.  Relationships at work play a HUGE part here, not only how you conduct yourself with your coworkers, but how they act towards you.  Dont get me wrong, you will have politics everywhere you go, but sometimes, people take it a bit far.  Its somewhat discouraging to see some people willing to do anything they can to get ahead, even say or do things to discredit people they work with.  I guess what im getting at is that i never thought id be doing what im doing today or where im at today 6-8 months ago.  I guess i didnt really didnt have a good idea what i was getting into at crowe.  While that is both good and bad, it is what it is, and im working with it.  Trying to do my best and seeing where i can go and what i can do.  If there is one thing that ive been able to find out, its that i dont know where im going in 6-8 months.  Who knows what could happen from now untill january 1st.  Things could change, they could stay the same.  Again, it all is a matter of time and opportunity.  One thing i do know, is that I'll be in columbus.  My transfer date has been approved by the powers that be at Crowe, and as of october 1, ill officially be in the Columbus office .  Spending time down in columbus lately, being around the city, going to see Tom and Les, its been great.  Not only do i love that city dearly, but it will be exciting to be there with Katie and be able to start getting ready for the rest of our lives.  Im so excited for that.  So besides all the ranting about work, what else have I been up to?  Well, its june, so i celebrated my 23rd birthday on June 8th.  It came and went without much fanfare.  I guess thats the difference between being 23 and being 13.  10 years really can suck the opportunities for parties with games, prizes and other festivities.  Not to say that party hats are overrated, but i spend the day working from home, petting the cat and on conference calls all day.  Definately not how i celebrated my birthday last year, and nowhere close to how i celebrated my 21st.  However, it was nice to go home over memorial day weekend, spend some time with my family, go out to eat and just relax for a while.  Getting older is no fun, i remember when i was in high school, and all i wanted to do was be on my own, working, making money, being successful, etc etc etc.  Now here i am, and i guess its not the shining marvel i hoped it would be.  Katie comes home this weekend.  She has been on the field camp trip she took last year, but this summer she was a teaching assistant for it.  Sounds like it wasnt all she hoped for either.  But i know she enjoys being out there overall, and loves doing what she does.   Itll be nice to see her this weekend, spend a long weekend with her(hopefully) and hear the stories shes been trying to tell me for a while now.  I cant believe its been close to 2 months since ive seen her.  She left around memorial day, but due to my work schedule, other things that came up, we havent seen each other since early may.  I think we are definately due for some quality time.  Also, since it is june, i had to partake in my summer vice.  Dave Matthews Band tour came around, and while i couldnt go to as many shows as i normally do because of work, travel, etc, i was still able to go to 3 shows.  One of them was in columbus, and i took Red.  Good time was had by all.  While i wasnt overly impressed with the energy of that nights show, it wasnt bad.  I got to hear some of the new songs they have been working on.  While i heard them for the first time after downloading them off a message board, they keep getting new twists and turns.  Hearing them live is a whole different ball game.  It was nice to go to Germain Ampitheatre again, but the real kicker was the 2 nights in Burgettstown, PA.  I drove out and spend friday - monday morning with Sloka in Pittsburgh, had some good times, saw some sights, and went to the 2 shows out there.  First night, had decent seats in the front part of the upper pavilion, and the 2nd night...4th row center.  It was insane.  Seeing DMB play that close to the stage is a whole different experience.  Facial expressions, clarity of vocals, seeing Dave do his traditional feet dance up close...its amazing.  Its going to be hard to ever top that show.    Now im in the chicagoland area, staying with my folks and working on a job out here.  Its been nice to see my parents, got some new clothes, spent some time with Missy and her husband.  Also, coming home means i get to mess with networking stuff for my parents, including their new wireless print server and laser printer they picked up yesterday...the print server turned out to be a complete pain in the ass for cross platform printing.  There has to be an easier way...  Whats up next?  Hopefully going to spend time with katie this weekend, then off to columbus next week, then spending 2 weeks in south bend for our official training.  You may ask yourself, didnt you start at crowe 7 months ago?  The answer to that would be yes.  However, this is how they do it, so i get to spend 2 weeks in south bend doing that.  Who knows, it could be a good time.  Hopefully ill post less information more often.  However, travelling kind of wears me down, hell, i dont know who even reads this thing anymore.  Leave me a note, call me, IM me, whatever.  Hope all is well with everyone.  BW
