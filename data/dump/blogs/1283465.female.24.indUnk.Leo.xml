       i may have to modify my work ethics once i transfer stores.  although maybe i'm not transferring stores at all.  somebody that i met off of nerve before chris has been talking me up to some recruting chick at a place called rotary international.  not for profit, they are, which makes me wonder how i'm going to become a multi-billionaire working for a company that isn't, well, all about profits.  i'm trying to do the math.  i've never been good at math, though.  like when customers ask me how much everything is going to cost them, i kind of stand around and stare off into space for a good five minutes, moving my fingers back and forth and tilting my head first right and then left before responding, "tell you what.  let me put it into the computer, give you a price, and then you can decide."  "can't you just tell me the price right now?"  "no, not really."  i think i'm going to feel kind of bad if i do get this job at rotary international, seeing as how this guy was interested in dating me before.  maybe, in return for employment, i can set him up with one of my single friends.  except i don't really have any.  so maybe i can just send him a potted plant or arrange for a donation to some kick ass charity, like hats for fat people, in his name.  and then instead of writing out the check for hats for fat people, i'll just keep the money for myself and no one will really know.  yeah, that will be a lot cheaper than a potted plant.  besides, plants tend to die.  and how much money am i going to be making anyhow- remember, this is not for profit.  and that goes against every core belief i have.  i'm a hell of a humanitarian.

       he's a people people person.  i think he thinks i'm a people person.  i guess i  can  be a people person, but i'd also like to think i'm a people people person as well, or maybe just a person.  i can get sick of people people and even people people people but after i'm alone for about 5 hours, i find that i need to go scope out some people.  people people, usually, although people people can monopolize the conversation, which is only fun for one person, not two persons.  i hope i don't ever monopolize the conversation too much; of which, speaking, i find a conversation is at its balanced best between two people people persons, or, hell, even one people person (who has the right idea about what it means to be a people person and knows the proper way to engage others who are more people people people than people people) and a people people person.  the more i write "people," the more it looks like i'm spelling it wrong.  what was my point in the first place?  my favorite cereal is cinnamon toast crunch, and my morning routine when i'm at home includes about 2 hours of comedy central.  could i ever be a stand up comedian?  doubtful- those are REAL people people.  not like me.

       i haven't gone to work hungover in quite some time now.  this morning, i woke up and had to ask myself what month it was.  last night, i went to a club and did my usual disappearing act, because, you know, i like to go out with friends but i don't actually like to *hang* out with friends.  so i found myself in the vip room.  apparently it was some guy named larry's birthday.  i parked myself in a chair and somebody asked, "how do you know larry?"  i said, "i don't.  but i've been looking for a chair for fifteen minutes now, and i'll be damned if i'm going to get up and leave."  i was later introduced to larry.  he was nice.  i certainly don't miss going out for such nights.  bars, clubs- the whole point is to meet someone cute.  and i have someone cute.  so there really was no point.  at least i found the chair.

       so the big gossip is that  urlLink this girl  used to work with me a couple of years ago at lenscrafters.  and now she's chasing mr. firestone.  i really hope she loses; i never liked her due to the fact that she was a vain, stupid, snot-faced bitch.  or maybe i hope she does win- i suppose it doesn't quite matter.  her occupation now?  child life specialist.  bet you anything she's a baby-sitter.

       here's a favorite favorite- mold-a-rama.  so my idea.  christmas in july.  i've never actually thrown a party as i've never really had a space in which to have one- but i think christmas in july will be a great idea for a "mixer" party thrown at the new apartment once we're all moved in and settled.  i can invite the few friends i still have left over from around here along with chris, jordan, and ocean's gang, and we can all drink egg-nog, maybe have my favorite holiday movie ('mixed nuts') playing in the background, of course i'll put up lights (but probably not a tree, let's not get stupid)....  bill offered to dress up as santa and suggested a white elephant grab-bag.  and, you know, other such holiday stuff.  i think it's the best idea i've ever had, after that other good idea i had.... which ended in misfortune, so let's not discuss it.  i'm a big, gigantic dork.    sometimes i get really upset with myself for no good reason.   i worry a lot about annoying people, like by calling them or wanting to talk.  i hear that calling people is really the worst thing one can do.  at these times, i try to step back from myself and say, "what the fuck's your problem- dumbass?"  of course people want to talk to me!  why wouldn't they?  i keep on asking.  anyhow, i've got my tie-dyed shirt soaking in the tub, staining the entire thing purple.  great idea, having a tank top tie-dyed with lens tints.  it looks cool, but will i ever get to wear it without my chest-al area becoming faintly tie-dyed as well?  i suppose we'll all find out.

       and these are a few of *my* favorite things:  anything free with purchase.  novelty socks.  hearty laughter.  jesse white.  postcards and keychains.  apple scented lotions/ body sprays.  sugar in the boat packets ("boat sugar").  personalized coffee mugs.  the phrase "on it like blue bonnet."  instant messaging.  x-ray glasses.  thrift store t-shirts.  headstands.  cosmopolitans.  back scratchers.  randomly hummed songs ("the rhythm is going to get you, the rhythm is going to...").  two dollar movies.  seattle.  belching.  roller coasters.  david sedaris and george carlin.  oil pastels.  the idea of camping but not the actual execution.  to be continued.  more fun will be the list of things i *wish* were my favorite.  but aren't.  at all.

       it's always so quiet here.  new home:  rolling meadows.  1550 square feet.  me and chris in the master bedroom, ocean and jordan duking it out to try and screw the other with the 10 x 11 foot bedroom.  we still have to sign the lease, but everything looks pretty damn good.  june 1, good-bye tinley park.  i'm only going back for weddings and holidays.  or possibly to steal cans of tuna from my mother's pantry.  the lady who showed us the apartment was a real nut job who kept repeating, "i'm normally not like this."  yeah, sure you're not.  i hate to admit this, but i couldn't stop looking at her ass; she'd squeezed a pretty sizable rump into very tight black spandex pants, and every time she turned around too quickly, i felt the need to jump back as to not get injured.  we looked at 4 1/2 apartments today.  some of the apartments felt like resorts, what with the weight rooms and the "planned activities."  "we all celebrated mardi gras together; it was a real blast.  and on tuesdays we give cooking lessons."  i can't see myself participating in events arranged by the management of an apartment complex.  if i did go, i'd feel the need to explain myself to everyone else involved.  "i'm not really a loser; it's just that... my car broke down... and i can't get to anywhere else... hey, pass the spinach dip."  spinach dip.  what a good idea.

       feeling a little lightheaded.  keep thinking of the phrase "anal canal" only pronouncing "canal" so that it rhymes with "anal."  go ahead- try it out.  anal cane-al.  also- keep listening to that damn voicemail left by my teacher.  "everyone loved your story.  you were going to be in the national contest....  such a shame you're no longer a student."  i'm an idiot.  oh, well.  it wasn't my best story anyways.  so there's still hope that fame, riches, and personal satisfaction may one day still await.  i guess i'll put this pistol away and try to think happy thoughts.  at least it's a good hair day.

       tom didn't know what a hymen was.  i'm about to explain when a customer walks in, and tom, not seeing the customer, says, "so where exactly is this hymen located?"  i swear sometimes.  i won a writing contest.  my story was about a talking bear and an alcoholic.  real literary genius at work over here, let me tell you.  anyhow,  i won $500 or something.  but the thing is, i dropped the class at the school hosting the contest... and now i don't get squat.  the teacher called to say my prize was going elsewhere.  fuck everyone and their mother.  it just figures.  at least i won something.  in theory.  i went to the vfw tonight for dollar beers.  it's just fun to say i went to the vfw.  did not, however, talk to any actual vets.

       sitting outside a few minutes ago, i noticed etchings on one of the posts of our deck, which has a lot of posts for not having much of a roof.  these etchings mark the height of marcia and myself starting from 1987, the first summer we lived here, and continuing, on my side of the post at least, until 1997, when i turned 17 and would most certainly not be getting any taller.  looking at this post, i felt kind of sad, remembering how my dad used to call us outside on boring summer afternoons to mark how much we'd grown in the past 12 months.  my sadness came mostly from the assumption that my dad himself must get sad whenever he notices this post.  so, yes, he sees this post every once in a while, feels a little heartbroken from the memory of two little girls that he had so much love and hope for, and then proceeds to come inside and start yelling about how i need to find a goddamn job already and, hey, is that alcohol on my breath?  i get sad at times for no good reason.  i get deliriously happy at other times, for no good reason.  and on yet other occasions, i find myself speaking in tongues and spinning my head around on its neck while my pupils dilate and shrink, dilate and shrink.  then i turn to the person sitting next to me on the train and say, "excuse me, i don't know what's come over me!  hey, would you mind lending me a few bucks for my ticket?  and then another few bucks for a corn dog?"  i grew half a foot between '91 and '92.  but since '97, it looks like i've gone down a few inches.  strange.

       last night, my own  urlLink dream  was  urlLink not unlike  an episode of " urlLink crime scene investigators ," or " urlLink csi " as the kids like to call it, in which i was thoroughly  urlLink investigating  various  urlLink undisclosed   urlLink crime scenes .  i'd  urlLink walk  into  urlLink whatever  place needed checking out,  urlLink waving  my arms around and kind of slinking back and forth between the  urlLink murder weapon  lying on the carpeting and the refrigerator stocked with buckets of  urlLink chicken  and biscuits (mmm,  urlLink love affair  with butter) and repeatedly assure everyone that all was " urlLink under control -" or "uc" as the  urlLink kids  like to call it.  between  urlLink bites  of chicken (and  urlLink biscuits ), of course.  it was easy being a detective.  i kept getting barbeque sauce all over the evidence, but i did a great job of swabbing my q-tips against everything, including the tips of the ceiling fan blades, as to be able to say, "i did a great fucking job, you ass.  didn't you see me using the q-tips?"  in the end, i did not actually solve the crime, although i have a sneaking suspicion it was colonel mustard in the den with the flashlight.  at least i got paid; i drove off in the yacht parked in the driveway right into a waiting sea of what appeared to be  urlLink ecto cooler .

       i feel like going swimming.  i've never cared much for swimming because of the whole contact lens thing, the whole having to wear a bathing suit thing, the whole "i once dove off a diving board and hit my face on the floor of the deep end" thing, the whole "anyone could be urinating at any given time" thing, the whole "exercise is for assholes" thing- but man would it be nice to do a few laps, maybe get someone to blow up an inner tube for me, buy me a fruit drink, fetch my sunglasses, rub sunscreen all over my shoulders and arms and legs...  okay, i don't think this is about swimming anymore.

       i'm eating lamb and watching "sleepless in seattle."  for the last ten minutes, i've been thinking about bambi.  it took me this full 10 minutes to realize bambi would be venison, not lamb.  all these cute animals confuse me.  so now i'm going to stop thinking about bambi and start thinking about ariel.  oh, wait- ariel was a mermaid.  i can't watch "sleepless in seattle" anymore, despite my deep love affair with butter.  i mean, seattle.  it's on the turner classic movie station- when did "sleepless in seattle" become a classic?  and when did i start watching the turner classic movie channel?  and why is this movie making me think of chris?  he's never even been to seattle.  and he doesn't have the turner classic movie channel.  or any channel, for that matter.  i wonder how chris feels about venison.  lamb, even.  i'm moving in june regardless of what everyone else does.  except for chris, i may have to take him into consideration.  "when harry met sally" is next.  i absolutely cannot stay within the vicinity of this tv set.  it's a good thing that one doesn't take place in the pacific northwest.  then i'd be screwed.  as it is, i'm going to find another cartoonly adorable animal to devour and then find something of ultra-importance to take care of.  such as that peace treaty i've been drafting.  or the finishing touches of that bionic limb.

       so i went ahead and linked to this dude  urlLink dax's blog  despite not knowing him.  but, alas, i couldn't help myself.  that's some funny shit, and funny shit deserves to be read, or at least linked to.  if i'm overstepping any boundaries or invading anyone's privacy, then i'll go ahead and fuck off.  but until then, the link is up.  i've got nothing to say.  last night, i won big at the academy awards.  academy awards party, that is.  i considered, briefly, giving an acceptance speech when brent handed me the gift certificate to the movie theater, but, really, i don't have that many people to thank.  "i did this all myself, without any help, and certainly without the grace of god or the support of my parents.  in fact, all 3 were actually rooting  against  me on this glorious night of nights.  but i showed them, and i shall continue to show them.  why?  because i'm awesome- and don't any of you forget it."  i will not be using my gift certificate to see "chicago."

        urlLink  after dropping  urlLink mr. b  back at the urlLink  bbd  after eating  urlLink cfcb , i decided to waste some  urlLink time  by exploring  urlLink arlington heights , as it will, in  urlLink june , become if not my new home then one of the surrounding neighborhoods of my new  urlLink home .  i did some  urlLink stalking  of what will be my new place of  urlLink employment , and then purchased a few small items, including  urlLink coffee ,  urlLink cigarettes , and  urlLink tampons  before heading back to  urlLink "el lovenest de chris."   in june, we're going to be living together... in  urlLink sin .  maybe i'll make him propose to propose to propose to me in may, just so that i can still go to church without being spit on by all of the other parishoners.  not that i'm a big fan of going to church, but i'd like to know that i still have the option of going to  urlLink bingo  night should all other plans, including  urlLink asphyxiating  myself, fall through.  but, yes.  i'm quite eager to sign the lease for this apartment as it will be much like signing a lease to make sure chris doesn't dump me for at least another 12 months or so.  because if he does, i'll have access to all of his clothes and computer stuff, which i will promptly set on fire or give away to needy  urlLink orphans .  not to mention all of the food i'll be able to  urlLink tamper  with.  and, let's not forget, i once figured out a way to rig a  urlLink toilet  so that, upon being flushed, it promptly explodes.  ah, but i kid.  it's actually more of an  im plosion.  chris first read my blog when i was in  urlLink las vegas .  that was a little over two months after we'd started  urlLink dating , and so there was a good eight weeks worth of entries about how great chris was, how  urlLink happy  i was to have found him, how i wanted him to have if not my first born then at least a urlLink  really nice houseplant  or something, etc, etc.  after he disclosed that he had read it, he said something along the lines of, "now that i'm reading your blog, you're probably not going to rave about me as much."  i said, "i'll always rave about you."  but, yeah, i can't rave about him as much anymore.  it just doesn't sit well with me.  i can, however, admit a few things.  i  urlLink can't wait  to live with him.  i love every minute i get to spend with him.  and contrary to what he may believe, there really is no one else quite like him.  well, there are a  urlLink few  people like him.  but they're all already  urlLink taken .  man, do i crack myself  urlLink up .

       strolling along past the starbucks, i look in and see a girl- erin- i recognize from high school.  as is my instinct, i look away and keep walking.   of course, she comes running out, calling my full name and everything.  i turn around and stare blankly at her for a calculated second, then say, "erin?  erin!"  much like discussing war, i try to avoid these pointless little conversations with people who i once sat behind in an english class and never really talked to in the first place anyhow.  we were never friends.  our word count over those entire four years was probably well under fifty, seventy-five tops.  and now we have to "catch up" like she was once the surrogate mother for my first born son?  like i had once saved her family from a burning house, delivering cpr to her grandfather and everything?  i don't think so.  we stood out there for a few moments while we traded basic demographic information- where are you living, what school did you go to, what's your present occupation- and then i made like tom and cruised, wondering if maybe i'd have more friends if i wasn't such a stone-hearted bitch.  nah, doubtful.  when my high school reunion rolls around, i'm going to find myself a bar stool and a trivia box.  unless i'm single and desperate; then i'll go back and see if any of my old crushes are single and desperate as well.  ah, good times.

       blah, blah, blah.  blah.  blah?  blah blah!  so i'd love to write some long and involved entry on the war, but we here at jackie and co. go out of our collective way to avoid dealing with any news and/or information that might be unsettling or troublesome to think about.  understatement of the year on both accounts.  war is dumb.  people are going to die.  i hope not a lot of people die.  i hope the war is short.  and i hope no one tries to talk to me about this.

       i can hear birds chirping.  this is a good sign.  spring is tied with autumn for my second favorite season following summer.  if i had nuts, i'd tell winter to suck them.  i can't wait to go to work but only because i'm stopping for coffee and an egg and cheese croissant on the way.  also because i'd like to leave this house and enjoy a cigarette.  my mother's having a sleepover next weekend with her 4 sisters because my dad's going out of town.  this spells certain doom; 4 may be walking in, but surely only 2 will leave alive.  actually, it's summer, then spring, then autumn, then whatever else i can put in front of winter, then winter.

       i got myself a hair cut tonight- no more ponytails for a while, that's for damn sure.  the hairdresser did such a nice job of straightening and styling my hair that i didn't have the heart to tell her the truth when she asked if i had any special plans tonight.  "it's my brother's birthday," i fibbed, imagining what this brother might look like.  he'd probably be really handsome, good at spelling, appreciative of pottery.  "we're all going downtown.  to celebrate.  this birthday."  now here i am at home.  i'm considering getting someone to take a photo of me.  a lot of people asked today if i was going to the irish parade tomorrow.  finally, to the 4th one, i snapped, "hey, do i *look* irish to you?"  my tone may have been uncalled for, but ever since i was a kid, i've rather disliked st. patrick's day.  teachers making you wear green, making you put "o" or "mc" in front of your last name for the day.  i'm getting all tied into knots just thinking about it.  i said today, to tom, "i bet you're regretting that you were ever nice to me in the first place."  i feel like i sometimes take advantage of poor tom with my long and frequent breaks, my flagrant disregard for his authority, my constant whining that i'm ready to go home, and the times i sometimes hide underneath the doctor's office's reception desk so that i can eat from my secret cache of french fries.  not to mention, when heather's there, my productivity has to go down by at least 74%.  we spend a lot of time practicing ice skating moves and stealing shopping carts from sears for purposes of carrying lunch up from the food court and rolling our personal effects around in.  the best was when dr. maes came out from the breakroom one day on a busy sunday and said to our general manager- "do you know there's a shopping cart in front of the microwave?"  okay, maybe you had to be there.  sometimes i think about getting a job, in marketing, and being in charge of naming colors, like for j. crew or something.  harbor blue.  raspberry creme.  spiced tea.  starlit evening.  gravel.  aphid.  artichoke heart.  blooming baseball.  bejeweled cloud.  muck.  but then i think about what kind of person that would make me, and i have to buy a shirt in wide-eyed canary just to make myself feel human again.

       yesterday, chris and i were going to go look at apartments until he mentioned that he's still not sure whether or not his boss will want him (and pay him) to move out to california.  everything's kind of on hold, i suppose, until he finds out.  either way, i think we're living together- whether in nw suburbia with ocean and jordan or s california with ocean and sunshine.  pacific ocean, that is.  it does not escape me how crazy this all is.  4 months ago, i did not even know him.  now i'm willing to move across the country to be with him.  it's no big secret how i feel about him, so we don't need to get into that....  but everything that has happened up to now and is going to continue to happen- it still amazes me.

       tom went home early and gail had management type things to do in the office, and that left me in charge for the evening.  the second she walked back there, i clapped my hands together and said, "listen up!  jackie's the boss, and a few things are going to have to change!"  changes enacted-  the alternation of cigarette breaks.  the three of us took turns every 15 minutes.  there was never more than 2 people on the floor at a time.  which i didn't see a problem with.  everyone else works while jackie designates work.  i sent valerie down for ice cream.  we all had ice cream.  i think it helped, um, productivity.  yeah, productivity.  nametags, optional.  don't know how much to discount off of a customer's insurance policy?  estimate high and worry about it tomorrow.  i actually just gave somebody a frame.  be nice to jackie, get a frame.  ***  i sat outside for a while on one of my breaks and thought about my stance on white sneakers.  prognosis, negative.  maybe if your jeans cover them a bit and your shirt is a light grey or something- that might be fine.  but in general?  heinous.

       today seems like a good morning.  i slept extremely well last night, and my body almost doesn't know what to do with itself now.  soon i go off to work to begin the task of avoiding work.  but until then?  i blog.  driving home this morning, i almost threw my cigarette into the automatic toll booth.  i almost lit my quarter.  i went to mcdonalds and ordered an egg mcmuffin, no meat, and recieved extra meat.  i cut my legs in the shower.  i was shaving my legs so i could wear a skirt to work.  now i'm not going to wear a skirt anymore, due to the band-aids.  plus, what the hell do i need to wear a skirt for?  because i want to?  because every once in a while i get into a skirt-wearing kind of mood?  because i like my legs?  because i like the fact that others like my legs, too?  this is more reason for me to wear pants.  every day.  for the rest of my life.  until it's time to wear shorts again.  strangely enough, i like jeans but not khakis- but khaki shorts and not denim ones.  i dreamt that i was buying back-to-school supplies.  trapper-keepers and pencil cases, the rubber erasers that i used to enjoy chewing on so much.  i'm thirsty.  these pretzels- they're making me thirsty.

       i love going to the dollar theater.  only now it costs two dollars.  this two dollars includes the village of tinley park's "amusement" tax.  i wonder, if i don't really enjoy my two dollar movie, can i get that tax percentage back?  and if i've ever amused anyone else, like by telling a good joke or falling on my butt while trying to open my car door, can i claim that on my own taxes and use it to up my refund?  if only i had a good accountant who could answer all these questions for me.  as it is, i have to lay awake at night wondering.  wondering.  wondering.  i love seattle.  i love movies that take place in seattle, even if they're bad movies.  but, for two dollars, there really is no such thing as a bad movie.  bad becomes halfway decent.  and good movies?  at two dollars, they're downright orgasmic.

       you may ask why i would choose to name my blog after one of the  urlLink most derogatory songs ever .  i may be glad you asked, because no one else ever has.  they ask what "under my thumb" is  from , but then the conversation often turns to other topics, such as the time i had scarlet fever and then got yelled at for taking all the frozen vegetables into bed with me.  i'm sorry, but who has time to make an ice pack?  it's not like the packaged peas were going to become infected or anything, and, besides, the label gave me something to read.  anyhow, i'll let my dad field this one.  "i've been a fan of the rolling stones for a lot longer than my daughter has.  this is because i'm a lot older.  i can tell you story after story about the good old days when packaged peas cost significantly less.  anyhow, one day my lovely, intelligent, amazingly gifted and kind-hearted daughter jackie and i were sitting around the living room listening to her recently acquired stones' cd.  i think she may have been having a moment of sorts, because she turned to me and said, 'i think this song could be interpreted several ways.'  she had to repeat herself a few times because i wasn't listening, too busy reliving somebody else's glory days involving a football team i was never on.  but then she said, 'i think this could be a girl talking to herself, like she's finally got parts of herself under control.'  i said, 'yeah, is that what you think?'  she said, 'no, not really.  but i'm looking for something to name my blog, and i think 'under my thumb' has a really cool sound to it.'  then she logged on to the computer.  i'd been suspecting that for some time she was using it as a dating tool, trying to meet guys.  for christmas, she confirmed my suspicions and brought home that lovely, intelligent, amazingly gifted and kind-hearted boy chris.  i really like that guy.  he's half italian, you know, and i for one hope he's around for a long, long time."  thanks, dad.  other favorite stones' songs include "wild horses," "ruby tuesday," and "angie."  i have an especially good story about "angie."  maybe i'll get my dad to tell us that one a little later when he's not so busy watching cnbc.

       syntax error.  fucking hell.  if anyone, ahem, wants to fix this for me, my new username is ferclyn.  you already know the password.  i've put forth a lot of effort to switch around my blog url and whatnot.  i really screwed up a good thing, because now i have the aforementioned syntax error.  perhaps i didn't think things through?  sometimes i get carried away for no good reason.  i've had a fight with a friend, and i'm not dealing with the good-bye all that well.  dan, if you're on this page, you must have done some detective work, going to chris' blog or something.  stay away from my boyfriend's blog, goddammit.  and especially stay away from mine.  it's not fair; you can't tell me that you don't want to be friends anymore but then still want to know what's going on in my life. i simply won't have it.  it's hard, ending things like this with you.  i feel like i'm losing a brother.  i know we've drifted pretty badly, but i never once thought we'd stop being friends altogether, and thinking about this hurts.  i'm going to miss you.  i wish things hadn't turned out like this, but i suppose we made good use of our time together.  you're a huge part of who i am, and i'm always going to think about you and hope that you're doing what is making you happy.  now let it be.  please don't come back here.

       as you'll read in ocean's blog, fish can feel pain.  when i woke up this morning and was preparing to go home, i was in the living room of the guys' apartment getting my crap together when ocean announced this to me, in lieu of greeting.  "they've proved that fish have feelings," he declared.  the thing is, i thought he said, " you've  proved that fish have feelings," which got me to thinking, "i did?  wow, i'm barely awake, and already i'm doing awesome things."  i knew i was a scientist at heart.  although i'd much rather be described as a poet at heart, an artist at heart, even a cat lover at heart, because- as several embarrassing anecdotes involving high school science labs gone horribly, horribly wrong could prove- i've never really been one for the science.  the math, either, unless it has to do with calculating my ultimate savings from marked down jeans off the clearance rack.  that's me- perpetuating gender stereotypes left and right.  but hey- who else in the room can say they've proved that fish have feelings?  huh?  huh?  oh wait, i didn't do that either.

       i am a stranger in a strange land.  i suppose i'm starting to feel semi- comfortable here in the northern suburbs, but i was kind of hoping that by the time i actually did move up here, i'd know the area like the back of my hand.  nothing stinks more than having to ask for directions to the nearest walgreens.  i have this feeling that, during the summer when i want to leave the apartment by myself to go to the best buy or some shit, i'm going to have to use mapquest.  which is ri-goddamn-diculous.  ah, well, i still have a month or so before i have to really worry about it.  today, while chris was at work, i found my way to the jiffy lube (where i was told i have all sorts of belt problems that they can't even begin to fix, those fuckers) and then to borders where i could entertain myself for a while with some free magazine reading.  i spilled a little coffee on the newest copy of "utne," but that's what they get for allowing me to peruse their merchandise after all of their signage practically forces me to buy a beverage.  leaving borders, i made a wrong turn, but even when i started to realize that nothing was looking familiar, i made myself keep going because, really, even the correct way back to the apartment wasn't going to look all that familiar.  if my memory serves me correctly, i think i hit lake huron before i finally admitted that i was lost and made the decision to turn around.  after all, i know for a fact that chris does not live anywhere near lake huron.  i'm sure after a period of no longer than 18 months, i'll be absolutely fine out and about on my own.  right now, though, i feel a bit like a retard.  here's something cool, despite this rampant retardedness: on my drive down rand rd. towards my new job, i can see the sears tower in the distance.  it's faint in the distance, but it's definitely there.  the odd thing is that where i live now in the southside, i'm about the exact same distance from downtown as we are up here.  and i *never* see the tower, not even when i stand on something tall and squint.  hmm.  so as long as i can see the sears tower, i'll always know which way is east.  southeast.  and as long as i know that... fuck, i'm just going to go out and buy a goddamn map.  but first i have to ask somebody where the map store is.

       do you ever feel like your life is just one trashy romance novel after the other?  i think this is how i'm going to start describing my life to strangers, like when i meet someone for the first time and they say, "tell me a little about yourself."  i'll say, "well, really, my life is just one trashy romance novel after the other," and then close my eyes, start fanning myself, and maybe slouch down in my chair a little, being sure to arch my back.  after i open my eyes, and maybe get out a few subtle moans, they'll probably be gone, scared off and perhaps a little creeped out.  in which case, mission accomplished.  either that or they'll be more interested in me than ever.  in which case, cool.

       i'm thoroughly upset, having lived through yet another sleepless, restless, agonizing night.  there must be something seriously wrong with me, but since i'm not a doctor, i don't know what that would be.  i can't fall asleep.  then, once i do fall asleep, i cannot stay asleep.  then, once i do stay asleep, i have sick, disturbing dreams.  then the the alarm goes off, and i feel like crying because i've really only been asleep for about 2 hours, 1 1/2 of which was spent in a dreamscape so horrific that i can't even write a blog entry about it.  i suppose i exaggerate.  i do get *some* sleep, but it's nowhere near the recommended dosage.  hopefully, i'll sleep well tonight.  i notice i have cycles; i'll go through about a week of shitty nights followed by about a week of normal nights followed by about a week that would have the possibility of being normal except for the fact that i keep eating mexican before bedtime.  ach.  now to pour the coffee.  i'm sure my excessive coffee intake, not to mention high alcohol levels and all those peanut m&m's i eat during day, have absolutely nothing to do with my lack of zzz's.

       carole got this job where, basically, she's going to be making more in a year than i'm going to be making in my entire life.  which is cool if you're into that sort of thing, by which i mean paying rent, affording food, not having to panhandle on corners, et cetera, et cetera.  however, the thing about this job- from what i understand- is that you actually have to devote a good amount of work to it.  like, not only do you have to work while there in the office, which sounds bad enough, but then you end up having to work while at home, or on the train, or anywhere, really.  imagine- you're doing spreadsheets in a public toilet and finishing up powerpoint presentations at your nephew's bar mitzvah.  what kind of life is that?  i've spent a lot of time feeling guilty for not truly wanting a career of any sort, a lot of time lying to everyone that i was looking for some powerful ceo-like position somewhere that would require me to wear nylons and put my hair back in a bun when, indeed, i haven't been looking for jack.  jill, either.  it's not what i want, the big-time job.  and i'm not ashamed to admit it, as least not anymore.  so i'm a slacker.  so i'm wasting my education.  so i may never have the kind of bucks that can afford such luxuries as a french chateau or, like, really expensive egg rolls.  fuck it.  i don't care.  i don't even wish that i cared.  congratulations, carole- this is what you've wanted.  but congratulations, jackie, as well- you also have what you've wanted.  not to mention, you don't have what you didn't want.  and everything in between?  those things are in their places, too.  ach.  what a waste of a blog entry.  i'm going now to do something productive, like stick bread in the toaster.

       they say the grass is always greener on the other side.  i think this is supposed to mean that other people's lives always seem better than your own.  that sentiment may at times be true, but why must we use the condition and color of someone's lawn to get this point across?  this old addage doesn't necessarily work for me because i for one plan on purchasing a house sometime in the future that will include an entirely cemented over back yard.  front yard, too.  who has time to spend mowing the lawn?  and watering it?  and planting crap?  grass is a waste of space; i'd rather be able to rollerblade around my home, organize some yard hockey ("game on!"), or maybe get out a bucket of sidewalk chalk and make the whole damn thing into an elaborate hopscotch arena.  the saying for me should be "the grass is always totally gone on the other side."  this would get the point across nicely.  i'm spending a lot of my down time thinking about the new apartment, which of course leads me to thinking about homes that i may own in the upcoming years.  i really should have been an architect of some sort; good  ideas like mine should not go to waste.  like putting a bathtub in the living room so that you can still entertain guests while getting all of your bathing done.  i'd also like to install an intricate system of ladders instead of having stairs.  with ladders, as we all well know, come chutes.  the whole roof would be a skylight, and there would be no hallways- you'd have to traipse through every room in order to get to your own.  which would require at least two doors for every room, which would up the number of door knobs, which would mean i would have more of these said knobs from which to hang my purses and belts.  also, it would mean that the residents of the home would have harder times ignoring everyone.  no coming home and going straight to your room!  first you have to walk through three other rooms, possibly past someone who was bathing in front of the company.  also, i've always preferred brick to wood.  so even the doors would be made of brick.  not the windows, though- those would still be made of glass.  stained glass, with portraits not of saints but of senators in various compromising positions.  yeah, but the cementing of the yard is truly the best idea i have.  i could park my cars anywhere i damn well pleased- biggest driveway ever.

       carole sent me a picture that she had drawn of me.  i love it.  i've realized that i've had several friends in my life that have drawn portraits of me- and carole has been the only one who, upon showing me the final result, has not made me want to dunk my head in the proverbial, or public, toilet.  i suppose this could be because carole knows to draw me as i want to be seen and not how i actually am seen- or maybe, and this would be awesome, she draws what she really *does* see- and, if so, that makes me incredibly happy.  i've always had issues with the way i look.  of course carole knows this.  once we were out having coffee, and i'd brought my sketch pad in with me.  she took it and told me to sit still, drawing away as i sat there downing the approximate 16 ounces.  when she turned to show me the result, i could see that it really may have been me- and still, surprisingly, i liked the way it looked.  "this is you," carole had stressed, carole who went out of her way to tell me whenever i was having a good hair day or if i happened to look good in some other way.... i didn't really deserve all that positive reinforcement, but this is what carole does.  even on the east coast, she still thinks of this and mails me a drawing that she knows will brighten my day.  i'm glad she's finally seen "amelie."  i'd mentally compared her to amelie upon viewing, since both amelie and carole devote themselves selflessly to other people's happiness.  in a lot of ways, i've wished i could be more like carole, since i don't always think i'm quite as good a friend as she is.  but i try.  and i love her.

       last year, i spent most of easter at a gas station.  i kid you not.  what kind of person spends easter at a gas station?  that's a very good question, but one that i don't necessarily feel like answering.  what an interesting fun fact, though.  the funny thing is that i didn't even buy gas.  i think the whole thing would actually make for a very good short story.  "easter at the gas station," by ferclyn jarrucci.  that's my pen name, by the way- ferclyn jarrucci.  look for my other best-selling works, including "new year's eve in a stairwell" and "thanksgiving in the coat room."  this year i spent most of easter in a car.  to chris' aunt's, to my aunt's, back to chris' aunts, back to chris', to the adult bookstore, back from the adult bookstore, etc etc.

       refrigerators should be see-through, so that you don't need to open them in order to view their contents.  either that, or i should have x-ray vision.  i suppose x-ray vision might be more than i can handle, though.  what would it be like to look at people, see everything going on inside of them, and still make casual conversation?  i'm sure i'd fail miserably.  "so that's what happens to swallowed gum."  "so that's what happens when you smoke while pregnant."  "hey, dude, for a man with one testicle, you're quite pleasant to be around."  "i'm sorry, roger, i need to ask you this....is that a... a... banana up your asshole?"  it'd be funny if that last one was said to, say, your investment banker.  screw x-ray vision.  bad idea.  but if only there was some way to tell what kinds of cheese were sitting in the meat bin without having to move from my chair.... yeah, that would rule.

       mood: shitty.  there are things i told myself i needed to do today, but i know i'm not going to do any of them.  that's just the way it goes.  it's past one o'clock, i'm home by myself, and i realize that i have yet to open my mouth and speak.  i'm not necessarily a chatty person, but this lack of talk is killing me.  i feel like making a phone call, but i know no one's around.  maybe i should call the national weather service and just babble to the recording.  the great thing about the national weater service, at least for chicago, is that they also give the time and lotto numbers.  weather, time, and lotto:  your three basic needs met with one local phone call.  bleh.  i'm going out.  i want to take another vacation.  i feel like i deserve a vacation every 3 to 4 months.  after all, my life is riddled with stress, what with running my own company and all.    majors offered by beltway community college:  dry cleaning.  scalp care.

       i've never understood the point of an away message.  if you're going to be away, then just close the damn program and we can all get on with it.  eh?  hung out with jason after work tonight, which was quite nice seeing as how i'd nearly forgotten what he looks like.  i especially don't ever recall seeing him in a cowboy hat and cowboy boots; i guess a lot can change in two and a half months.  he even said "howdy."  or maybe that was "hardly."  i ended up working ten and a half hours today.  i just kept volunteering to do things as if i were playing some personal game:  winner who works all gets all.  maybe my go-get-'em attitude was colored slightly by the fact that management was writing out reviews today.  i figure staying late on a day like today should negate the days like every other ones in which i whine, beg, pout, barter, and curse in order to get off a couple hours early.  that jackie.  such a selfless employee.  speaking of work, today i got hit in the face with a pupilometer.  it's a small machine that measures the distance between two pupils and, when thrust outwards, upwards, and into your forehead, hurts like a goddamn bitch.  i actually started crying in front of the customer that, albeit accidentally, clocked me in the face with it.  she looked like she felt really bad.  i felt bad for making her feel so bad- or maybe i just felt bad because of the horrible, horrible pain, and of course the possibility of bruising.

        check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out....   today is exactly "mid-april."  i suppose mid-april might have started a few days ago, but today's the precise half way point.  may is closer than ever, and after we fly through that (i always confuse memorial day with labor day), it'll then be june.  "dumb and dumberer" is coming out in june.  yes, i'm going to go see that, shut up.  what else happens in june?  it's a good month for graduations and weddings.  trips to san francisco.  immunity shots you possibly overlooked.  father's day and subsequent wal-mart sales.  the longest day of the year on the 21st.  i hear you can balance an egg on the sidewalk.  i myself have never actually tried, although i can tell you from experience that just when you think it's hot enough to fry said egg on sidewalk- it's not.  and the only thing you get from the whole activity is a messy sidewalk and a mother who runs out of the house screaming and threatening to beat you lifeless with a flashlight.  oh, to be nine again.  june.  may.  april.  today.  work.  bye.

       i dreamt that my life was a short-running sitcom.  at the end of every episode, i would turn to look at the camera and announce, 'only 3 more left!'   'only 2 more left!'  i slept long enough to get to the series finale, which was not only unfunny, but also anti-climactic.  in the last half hour installment of 'jackie and the things she does,' i went to a thrift store looking for pants.  i didn't find any that fit.  trying to leave, i discovered that the thrift store was located next to a bar.  i sat down at a table and ordered a martini.  the man next to me started a conversation; during this dialogue, it was revealed that we were in boston.  this whole time, my sitcom had been taking place in boston, and i hadn't even known it.  it's a sad thing to be taken off the air.  i guess i just couldn't get the commercial backing.  as well, i did not do so hot in the nielson ratings; i was beat out every week by fox's 'wanda at large.'  also by twenty-four other shows which i care not to list.  i kind of wish i could watch tv *now.*  chris' apartment is unequipped with such luxuries, so i'm stuck reading and computing.  these are not the ways the brain was intended to be used.

       i never did that find that toenail.  what a beautiful, sunny day.  i left my post at work to sit outside for a few moments.  when i realized how bright it was, i started squinting, then went back inside where it was nice and dim.  yesterday, i went down to cover for paula at the sunglass hut.  i spent the whole time thinking how much i really can't stand her, because she's so demeaning.  the sunglass hut is located next to the jewelry section, where i often try on jewelry.  it's also located next to hosiery, but i have yet to strip down and put on some nylons.  anyhow, paula comes back as i'm admiring this kick ass bracelet that has little jewels on it and marbled-looking squares.  i say, "this is cool."  i put it down, go upstairs.  later, paula comes up with a little box for me.  in it?  the kick ass bracelet.  i guess she ain't so bad after all.

       forget the hot number crunchers thing- apparently she didn't make the finalist trio.  i need to learn more spanish so i can better tell when people are talking about me.  i'm not too concerned about the other languages; it's only the hispanics that i feel may have it out for me.  due to poor planning on everyone's part, i was half an hour early for my doctor's appointment, for which the doctor herself was half an hour late.  if you do the math, that's one hour of sitting around.  i found a bench outside for a while, woke up a few people with some morning phone calls ("oh, you were sleeping?  sorry.  so, what's up?") then became engaged in a conversation with three very lovely women who gave me brochures entitled, "who is jesus?"  i asked if they had a few more i could distribute to my own friends and co-workers, but apparently giving out salvation isn't the same as throwing a candle party or working your way into a pyramid scheme.  not exactly, anyhow, but close enough.  i think i'll just xerox the brochures on my own and become an independent contractor, but only to supplement the income from my candle parties.  do you get income giving out jesus brochures?  i think the one lady picked my pocket, but i don't think the irs would necessarily classify that as income.  but i digress.  that's what i should call my blog: "but i digress."  and i'm just kidding about the candle parties.  i'm way too hip for that sort of bag.  my doctor was very nice and gave me a bunch of pills and stuff for free, which i had to wonder about, but then, as i was leaving, she began talking to the nurse.  in spanish.  i thought i heard the word "quaalude," but i suppose they could have been discussing lunch.  i'm chatting with mitch online right now.  our conversation goes along the lines of the revelation that jesus was santa and the apostles were elves.  he wasn't a carpenter, but a toymaker.  i can only hope to find appropriate christmas cards come december.  we also decided that god's major was genetic engineering, with a minor in ceramics.

       go to  urlLink www.wtmx.com   and vote for my cousin in the "hot number crunchers" contest.  she's the one showing a lot of leg and chewing seductively on a pen.  lisa fox.  lisa fox-y.  i can't wait for the "hot opticians" contest.  the picture i send in will be of me showing a lot of sock (probably my ducky ones) and chewing seductively on a pair of opthalmic frames.  i'll also be wearing a cheese wedge hat and an oversized button that says "kiss me, i don't smoke." ________________________  strange life moments:  when your dad gives you driving instructions to the gynecologist's office.  strange life moments:  when your dad, who you live in the same house with, sends you an e-mail telling you that, yes, after all, he is rather proud of you.  instead of saying it.  which i, actually, totally understand.  strange life moments:  when your dad gives you four more bob marley cds, as if one wasn't enough, as if i'd ever mentioned tolerating, let alone liking, bob marley, as if bob marley cds were the answer to any and all father/daughter bonding issues, as if-- well, to me, it just seems strange.  really strange.  but there's nothing wrong with expanding my scope of musical tastes, or marley-an tastes, so heck.  hell, even.

       i tried the strategy.  "chris, do you want some water?"  "not really, but if you're getting some, i'll have some too."  damn.  he knows the ins and outs.  i'm debating whether or not to pay my parking ticket.  if i don't, i may end up parking downtown one day soon and getting a boot on my car.  but, yes, while that would probably be a bitch to take care of, it sure would make for an interesting blog entry.

       1  chris:  do you want a beer? jackie:  sure. chris:  okay, they're in the fridge.  can you get me one, too?  **** 2  ocean:  did you call the apartment people? chris:  no. ocean: well, don't forget to call them today. chris:  okay. (minutes elapse) chris (casually):  oh, jackie, can you call the apartment people?  **** 3  chris (casually on way out door):  well, if you're going out for lunch, you should go to jewel and pick up a pound of chicken breast for dinner. (door closes) jackie:  notice how he just got out of not only paying for the chicken breast but also going to the store to get it. matt paul:  get used to it.  he used to ask me if i wanted a steak quesadilla.  i'd say yes, and then he'd say, 'okay, make me one, too.' jackie:  ha ha.  i had a similiar experience last night with beer.  (see dialogue 1)  ****  it's not that i mind as much as i find it funny.  i do admire his strategy a little; i may have to test that out myself.

       sleep is elusive.  really, i just can't do it anymore.  monday night i was up until four a.m. trying to get my brain to shut up; last night, at chris' apartment where he, matt paul, and i tried to all camp out in the living room, i switched back and forth from said living room to bedroom at least four times.  there was a lack of heat in the bedroom, along with a lack of blankets, so while in there i heaped clothes and towels upon myself in an attempt to keep warm.  i felt kind of like a homeless man covered in trash.  ah, trash.  back in the living room, i tossed and turned next to chris before finally falling asleep only to dream about having to put away what appeared to be a truckload of eyewear.  what a nightmare that was!  then the sun woke us up at the ungodly hour of 7:00 - and while i may have drifted back to sleep, it was only for filmy, tissue paper moments at a time.  and now i fear that tonight will just as bad, and the next night will be even worse because it will be the eve of a doctor's appointment, which young jackie has always been known to dread.  i used to hear stories all the time when i was young about people who 'didn't believe' in doctors and had never gone to a single one in all of their lives.  these people all ended up dead, of course, of some disease that could have been easily cured had it only been diagnosed.  i had it in my head i would end up being one of those 'i've never believed in doctors!' kind of people.  but, alas.  maybe i'll just die in a car crash instead of some preventable illness as planned.  so about that sleep.  i may need to cut back on coffee, which doesn't seem like a viable option, or figure out ways to relax myself while laying down.  perhaps counting small mammals will help.  or if i could figure out a way to stop my brain from saying, 'hey, have you heard the one about the pope, the rabbi, and the buddhist?'  that could maybe help as well.

       i've decided that i would like to be awarded an honorary degree.  preferably from an ivy league school, but i'll take whatever i can get.  i'd also like to give a commencement speech.  preferably one so full of despair and cuss words that my honorary degree is almost revoked.  almost.  i've also decided that i would like to discover a cure for something.  anything.  it doesn't necessarily have to be an ailment that humans suffer from; does anyone know of any rare but untreatable gopher illnesses?  decision number three:  i'd like to become a better cook.  i'm told it's no more than reading and following a recipe, and i know i've got that down pat.  just this afternoon i was able to remove the film from the potato portion (and only the potato portion) of my banquet meal *without* compromising the integrity of the film that covered the roasted turkey and the six to eight green beans, as per the recipe indicated on the side of the banquet meal box.  and i don't want to hear any arguments about the differences between "recipe" and "directions."  those are just semantics.

       get up, stand up, stand up for your right.  everyone in this household knows of jackie's approaching move in june.  and it is of both of my parents' opinions that i'll be home by september.  nice, huh?  it is of my manager debbie's opinion that "this is it."  her maiden name is the same as chris' (different spelling) and now she's a fan of saying, "i can't believe you might be a buerger!"  "different spelling, deb, and we're not getting married, we're just shacking up."  "yes, but still."  it is of gail's opinion that chris is the one.  of peggy's that chris is the one.  of tom's and carole's and julia's and heather's.  i wish my parents could have as much faith in this as the rest of the southside.  but alas.  it's of my opinion... well, i don't want to get too sappy here.  but every time i hear, "you'll be home by september," i think, "yes.  i will.  actually, i'll be home by june."  because that's what chris kind of feels like-  home.

       my dad is being exceptionally nice to me.  not that he's not normally nice to me, but i have to admit i find any extreme form of sweetness to be a warning sign of sorts.  plus he's been on my back lately because my employment status doesn't meet his standards, and when people get on my back, i tend to avoid them.  anyhow, yesterday he got me two cds i might appreciate- a rolling stones "the london years" and bob marley's greatest hits- and then proceeded to make me a steak dinner.  we all know how i feel about steak.  bloody steak.  he wanted to go for a walk after i was done eating, but i had to decline since i'd been up since 6 am (through no fault of my own) and was growing quite weary.  besides, it was cold, damn cold.  i wonder what he wants.  probably nothing.  he can be one hell of a guy.  and if he were home right now, i'd bet he'd make me french toast.

       any good party should involve a karaoke machine.  now i know that there are plenty of nay-sayers out there who will want to disagree with me on this one, but karaoke is a hell of a lot of fun.  it also helps to be drinking.  tonight at april's 30th birthday party (boy is that bitch old), i debuted a new song in addition to my old favorite "walking after midnight."  it's called "killing me softly" by roberta flack.  maybe you've heard of it.  if not, i can let you borrow my compilation cd "songs by women named roberta" on which it's track numbers 2, 7, and 12.  so there are  two  songs that i can sing really well.  two out of approximately 19,843,956,435 that i can't sing at all.  any good artist only needs to know about two songs anyways to be considered a raving success, though, so blow it out your ear.  i think chris should learn these two songs on his new keyboard, and then, together, we can take america by storm with our traveling show "the fergers take america by storm."  i've already got our costumes mentally designed.  i mean, designed mentally.  i mean, i hope chris likes tie-dye.  speaking of which, i wore my handmade tie-dyed tank top tonight.  i noticed, post putting it on, that the tie-dye happens to radiate out from the left boob-al area.  which is, you know, pretty sexy, in an odd "i wonder if she realizes how dumb that looks" kind of way.

       so, yeah, we saw the movie w/ ed norton.  the title escapes me, but i think it was something along the lines of "just you wait, jackie, just you wait," and then we (chris and i) went back to his apartment and spent some time fooling around on the internet, playing monopoly and scrabble and alienating perfect strangers in the chat rooms.  besides going to the movie (technically a matinee), it was sort of a non-night, what with us staying in and all- but oh how i enjoy the non-nights, the fact that we can do practically nothing and still be happy.  well, at least  i'm  happy.  i suppose i can't speak for him- but, hey, as long as  i  feel this good, who cares how  he  feels?  until we meet again....

       i truly believe:  when writing a poem, your choice of font can make or break it.  generally, a book can be judged by its cover, and should be.  also, a book can be judged by the picture of the author that accompanies it.  poetry by anyone under the age of 21 is automatically bad.  a limerick is always good.  prologues should have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the novel,  and large-print novels should be avoided like the plague, even if you do have trouble seeing.  they give off a negative vibe in regards to your intelligence.  i can't explain why.  ****  my mother reads large print novels.  with the aid of a magnifying glass.  and her vision is fine.  **

       is it too much to ask for the weather to make up its mind already?  it's like playing roulette trying to figure out what to wear each morning.  things i have eaten so far:  1 bowl of corn flakes.  1/2 chicken sandwich.  1 tuna sandwich.  1 microwaveable spaghetti "dinner."  2 cups of green tea.  1 container strawberry kiwi yogurt.  1 kiwi.  1 handful teddy grahams.  i've only been awake for three hours.  it's going to be a hell of a day-  i'm in the mood for a hoagie.

       should i feel bad?  the customer said, "pick out a couple of frames for me-"  so i went straight to the armani section.  seven hundred dollars later, the customer said, "am i going to need sun glasses?"  "oh, definitely.  everyone needs sunglasses, sometimes two or three pairs depending on whether or not you play sports or like to keep maybe one in the car and one at home."  "oh.  well, yeah, maybe i should get two.  what do you suggest?"  "here are a few more armani's."  i think i took him for the proverbial ride.  i felt bad all day.  then i check my commission screen and didn't feel so bad.  i laughed-  all the way to the bank, you might say.  and then i realized the bank was closed so instead i came home and checked my email.  i wish i recieved more email.   you can never get enough email.  or antibiotics, i hear that you should take an antibiotic for just about everything.  i'm going out with my mother in a few hours, just me and her.  this happens rarely in nature, and there's a reason for that.  the last time we went out, just me and her, i spent the following five hours driving around by myself and crying.  maybe it wasn't five full hours, but it was certainly no less than two.  i hope that once i move out, i can grow to appreciate how fucked up she is and maybe even establish some sort of relationship with her other than the one we have now- which i like to think of as apple-like, consisting basically of a core of resentment, the fruit of hatred, a shiny bitter skin, a small green leaf of too-small peace offerings, and the stem of any self-doubt i may have...  i mean root of all....  anyhow.  i haven't been able to eat apples in a while, but that's a different story that has nothing to do with anything else AT ALL, except for maybe that movie "titanic," which i can't believe i ever sat through.  all four times.  i mean, what were we, as a collective group of sappy fuckheads, thinking?  i can't remember.  and now back to daydreaming about the general layout of the wrigley factory.  oh the fun i could have in a gum factory!  kind of like that book, willy wonka and the chocolate.... something.  that was a movie as well.  probably worth renting, but i really wouldn't know because i haven't seen it.  it wasn't on afi's top 100- but who's in the afi anyhow?  certainly no one i know- and nobody i would WANT to know.  too many of my meal choices include noodles.  my personal food pyramid is all out of whack.

       we've got the apartment.  i've got my transfer.  we bought a bed.  and now all we do is play the waiting game.  aww, the waiting game sucks.  let's play hungry, hungry hippos.  i freaked out a little with chris yesterday, convinced that, now that the plans are all in place, he's going to change his mind at any time.  at least he knows i can't cook.  or, as was embarrassingly revealed before our lunch (which he made), i also don't know how to use a dishwasher.  all he wanted me to do was load it and i got confused.  it reminded me of the time i tried to make brownies- i just stood there holding the bowl and staring blankly at the eggs wishing that the ceiling would fall in so that i would have an excuse to take some aspirin and go lay down.  or like the time i tried to make hot dogs.  "do you boil the water first or do the whole thing simultaneously?"  i'm not a fan of cleaning.  when i do laundry, i do the whites and the darks, the towels and the sweaters, all at the same time.  i don't believe in hanging up coats, since they're going to have to be taken off the hangers eventually anyhow.  or making the bed, for that matter.  i've never taken the garbage out; it's always just kind of disappeared on its own, you know?    i'm overly excited about buying silverware and coffee cups.  about coming home from work and having someone to cuddle with- every day.  i'm excited about everything, really.  this is so out of character.  and now i go to work in orland.  after this week- only 8 more.

       my boyfriend told me today that if i stopped writing blog entries, he would no longer love me.  at least now i know what to do if i ever get sick of him and want to initiate a break-up without having to go through all the hassle of actually initiating the break-up.  no "i think we should talk" kind of conversations, no painful "this may not be working" whispers over breakfast... just the lack of a few mindless paragraphs per week.  day.  whatever.  the thing about blogging is that oftentimes i feel like i really don't have all that much to say.  and yet here i am taking up valuable internet real estate space.  i feel that my entries are very predictable at times.  what will jackie write about today?  work?  moving out?  her boyfriend?  the correct way to take home leftover fajitas?  my material  is getting old.  i think i may need to punch up my format a bit.  there are some of you out there who write hysterical blog entries time after time- you always have great, interesting, funny things to say.  and then there's me.  "i work at lenscrafters.  i'm transferring stores.  i can't sleep.  this is what i'm eating."  bleh.  if i had a bigger, more involved audience, as opposed to the three of you out there who do read this, i would write up a survey and ask you jackasses exactly what would be the best kind of things for me to blog about.  maybe i should write the survey anyway.  would you like to hear:      hilarious sexual antics and anecdotes     fart jokes    important health issues affecting the elderly    "what's the deal with" whatever diatribes    book reviews of modern classics    favorite hair care products    war coverage of various wars raging in countries that none of us truly care about    daily plagiarizations of song lyrics that i happen to enjoy... and want to take credit for     sigh.  i could also do recipes of the few things i know how to cook.  who wants to hear about how to toast the perfect... toast?  i'll be back when i have something awesome to say.  tomorrow there's a surprise party for me which i have had the misfortune of finding out about.   maybe after my surprise party, i'll have a great entry about how wonderfully i was able to feign surprise.  i'm even planning on feigning cardiac arrest.  like, if you're going to go out, you might as well go ALL out.  if he's going to stop loving me due to me not writing blog entries... maybe he's not the one... or maybe i should type *anything,* everyday, just to ensure that love will always exist.  kind of like how i've been doing.

       not only did i sleep soundly, but i slept forever- for over nine hours, by my calculations.  and while that may mean i won't sleep at all tonight- oh, how good i feel now.  today is my second to last day of work.  i've decided that i don't need to actually do any work today or tomorrow- like, what are they going to do, write me up?  on my two last days of work?  i think not.  i'm going to punch in today, and then sit down and- liesurely- drink my coffee.  i may even take my shoes off.  i ate my leftover fajitas this morning, the ones i referenced in last night's blog entry.  and you know what i realized?  if i would have put my leftovers together into actual fajita form, instead of just tossing all the necessary ingredients into that one take-home box last evening, i could have avoided having to sort through the big, kind of gross, mess that awaited me this morning.  that would have been the smart thing to do.  but i didn't do it.  anyhow, they were still kind of good.  last night my dream involved going to grad school.  and it was kind of a nightmare.  sometimes i wish i were more ambitious.  other times, i wish i had bigger boobs.  if i had to choose between a master's degree and bigger boobs (real ones, not fake ones) i'd probably choose the.... sigh.  sometimes i wish i were more ambitious.

       fajitas always seem like a good idea, but all they amount to in the end is too much assembly time and not enough eating time.  or, rather, the eating time *seems* shorter because, frankly, all that work can make lose one lose their appetite.  quickly, too.  then there's the problem of taking home fajita leftovers.  tonight, for instance, i scraped the remainder of my chicken, the rest of my tortillas, a handful of cheese, another handful of tomatoes, and a scoop of sour cream into one single take-home container.  just one, for all that slop.  and the result was not pretty.  the thing about fajitas is that they're relatively expensive- and after paying that much, i kind of expect my meal to be already completed. i feel like the cooking staff is getting off too easy here.  like, sure you've cooked the meat, but can't you just go ahead and put together at least *one* lousy fajita for me?  you lazy fuck.  sigh.  however, my eating habits often entail the arranging and rearranging of toppings, condiments, and dressings *anyhow*... so i suppose that, if i stop to think rationally, it's really just as well.  today i got a check in the mail for that story contest that i won.  pretty cool, considering that technically i wasn't supposed to win due to the fact that i dropped out of the class after only four weeks and was therefore no longer a student of the college that hosted the contest.  wow, what a long sentence, huh?  so i guess that as soon as i cash this fucker, i can tell everyone that i'm a REAL writer, a writer who has actually been paid for work submitted.  and, believe me, i will.  i'm listing this as occupation on my next income tax form.  occupation:  REAL writer.  i think i'm going to work my story into a full length novel, get that published, and then work on selling the movie rights.  with the money i make from that (and subsequent merchandising), i can take off some time and travel the globe.  or at least the midwest.  ah, this is the only time that i will ever win anything, ever, so i'm going to spend some quality time daydreaming about it. after all, that gymnastics contest i won in the second grade was a fluke, so that doesn't count.  really, it was all quite silly, considering one of the other girls i was against not only had a gimpy leg but also seemed to lack in depth perception.  oh well.  who cares about gymnastics anyways?  not me, i've got more important things on my mind.

       i'm not even sure what memorial day is supposed to celebrate.  veterans?  isn't that what veteran's day is for?  our independence?  isn't that what the fourth of july does?  the only thing i know for sure about memorial day is that it usually involves hot dogs.  but no fireworks, and that's really a goddamn shame.  i think memorial day is a marker for fashion laws.  as labor day says, "no more white," memorial day says, "break out the white!"  which is why i'm wearing white socks this afternoon, as opposed to the socks that i usually wear, which include little to no white at all.  i'm a fan of the multi-colored genre of socks, and i actually feel ashamed if i'm caught wearing plain white socks.  but i guess since memorial day has passed, it's okay for me to be wearing these plain white socks... right?  memorial day means "no more school!"  but since i graduated last year, that's what *last* memorial day meant.  so why did memorial day occur this year as well?  i think that if may had more holidays, besides cinco de mayo which doesn't belong to us anyways, then memorial day would not exist.  for instance, if we celebrated christmas in may, then the holiday gods would say, "hell, these fuckers had christmas off work, they don't need this memorial day garbage as well... that's just being greedy."  along those lines, i used to think the reason i was born in august was because there was no other major holiday in that month which would overshadow the celebration of *my* big day.  for a quiet little girl, i sure had a big head about myself.  that's august 6th, for anyone out there buying presents.  and, yes, there will be hot dogs as well... plus maybe any surplus fireworks left over from independence day.... or at least a sparkler or two.  right?

       last night, we went to see "bruce almighty."  this is a story about what would happen if jim carrey were god.  thus, it was bone-chillingly blasphemous and somewhat annoying.  i should train myself not to look forward to movies.  the more i look forward to a movie, the more likely it is to disappoint me.  let's refer to the 1997 case of "jackie vs. bean, the movie."  i'd always been a big fan of mr. bean.  when i heard that he was coming to the big screen, i believe i wet myself with excitement.  repeatedly.  i started down the countdown about half a year before the movie's release, marking my calendar in red ink and smiley faces.  the night "bean" came out was going to be the biggest night of my life- surely bigger than that year's prom or graduation, probably bigger than my future wedding or any award reception parties that would be maybe held in my honor one day.  i got a bunch of us to go see it that night- and when the lights came up after the film's conclusion, i considered going home to drown myself.  it was a cinematic disaster, and one that let me down so hard that my physician recommended a regular regiment of anti-depressants and a two week period in which i was forced to beat myself, nightly, over the head with a wooden baseball bat.  he even made me carve the bat myself, by hand, as part of the "treatment."  fall of 1997.  bean came out in maybe november, or was it october, and this was about the same time that my friend chrissy and i vowed to never wear the same outfit twice in a single year.  we figured that since we bought most of our clothes at the thrift store, it wouldn't be too expensive to have... 365... different outfits... for... 365... different days.  i don't remember whose idea this was, but i will admit that neither of us thought it out too well.  i was the first to cave.  i didn't think chrissy would notice, but notice she did.  i walked up to her locker one morning, and the first thing she did was widen her eyes and point at my sweater.  "you wore that in early september!"  she shrieked.  "what happened to our deal?"  i tried to tell her that it was a different sweater.  she didn't believe me.  the next day, she came to school in a t-shirt i recognized from mid-october... and that was the end of that.  "bruce almighty" wasn't terrible.  in fact, i'd rate it as highly as "okay."  but for all of you movie-goers out there- wait until it's at the dollar show.

       i look forward all year to the  panera bread  chain's "tomato and mozzerella salad."  see, i find it quite delicious. in late may, it arrives, every year like clockwork, and this is what i eat on my lunch breaks.  however, i do need to clarify a few things.  i eat all the mozzerella. mm.  then i eat two of the tomato wedges, two out of about twenty-four.  i barely touch the bread it comes with, and i scrape off all the basil on top of these said tomatoes and cheese.  i put the vinegarette sauce it comes with in the refrigerator (as if i'm saving all this dressing to give away as xmas gifts or something), and then my break is over.  this is how i eat my delicious lunch, and, every day in late may and throughout the whole summer, i find myself absolutely starving about two hours later.  so what do i do? i think to myself, "hmm.  i should go buy another tomato and mozzerella salad."  have i stressed how much i looovvvve this stuff?  i really think my parents should have been stricter with me when i was younger.  they should have enforced the whole "no leaving the table until your plate is clean" thing, because look at me now- i'm more wasteful than, say, johnny waste-a-lot.  mr. johnny waste-a-lot, from down the block.  if they'd said that to me, maybe i'd have learned to eat all of my food, at every meal.  hey, maybe i'd be four hundred pounds instead of one hundred.  or, maybe, i'd still be sitting at the kitchen table wearing my strawberry shortcake t-shirt and wondering when the hell i was going to be able to get up and maybe go finish the second grade.

       last night, i went to the  urlLink improv olympics .  i love going to improvistational shows- oh, i don't go to them nearly as often as i'd like, but my heart gets a-pounding whenever i do.  this is because i am a strong supporter of the comedic arts.  you should see the ribbons i hang around my trees.  anyways.  last night, i was struck by an incredible idea.  i want to do improv.  i want to take the classes, try out for the troupes, and then perform- oh, if i'm up there, imagine the hilarity that would inevitably ensue.  there was one girl up there last night who absolutely blew.  now, i don't mean to sound sexist, and let's remind everyone here that i too am female, but i always notice that the girls are never quite as funny as the guys.  and since i believe i am funnIER than the guys (or some of the guys)- i'd have to be a shoo-in.  no, really.  my only problem would be that i can be incredibly shy in front of groups of, say, three or more people.  even if i know them.  but everyone has their obstacles; jerry seinfeld, for instance, was jewish.  also, while i may consider myself rousingly funny, i have to admit that it's altogether possible that i couldn't *act* my way out of a paper bag.  altogether  likely , if i may say so myself.  but, hell.  i think it's possible that i may have just what it takes, once i multiply my confidence by about a thousand, to be an incredible improvistational success.  watch for me.  i'm gonna be big.

       i just read an  urlLink article  on cnn.com about a home-schooled boy winning a geography bee.  his parents are quoted as saying that they had decided before having kids that they would home-school all their children.  upon reading this, i instantly pictured what my own kids, if i were to have any, would be like should i decide to home school them.  for some reason, in this little vision of mine, they're wearing potato sacks.  i guess without the pressure of having to leave for school, there's also no pressure with having to look presentable.  their hair is all tangled and sticking straight-up, and there are crazed looks in their eyes.  the oldest boy is missing teeth, probably because they keep getting chipped due to all the time he spends gnawing on the leg of the dining room table.  they don't know any math.  at all.  history, forget it.  i mean, i tried with history, but it was all very vague and no exact dates were ever, ever given out.  "the civil war," i explained, "took place some time ago.  everyone who fought in the civil war had a handlebar mustache and was either a scorpio or a capricorn."  i've spent time reading them a lot of stories, but i've never exactly explained what fiction is.  this is why they look for jertains behind the curtains, cats wearing hats, and platefuls of ham served with sides of green eggs.  my kids will never win a geography bee.  in fact, i've neglected to tell them what their own damn zip code is.  i've possibly taken them on field trips.  such visited locations included sears, the pool hall, and the waiting room at the emergency room when we had to take my daughter in because she got her hand caught in the mouth of a badger during a biology lesson gone horribly, horribly wrong.  home school.  psh.  having kids.  psh.  attention, i have only six more days of work left in orland park.

       here's what everyone is saying about my novel:  "this exploration of the soul is not only rich with adjectives but also sparks heated, passionate debates on the correct usage of the semi-colon.  a must read for anyone who has ever questioned not only their existence but also which font style accurately reflects their personality type."  - richard spears, the new york times  "rousingly funny!  hip and quirky- a coming of age tale that runs rampant with symbolism and references more brands of shoes than one can count.  if you read only one book this year, read this one.  if you read only two books this year, then read this one twice."  - jane underwells, chicago tribune  "ferclyn jarrucci has created a page turner like no other.  from the first sentence, on through the middle sentences, and then up until the last sentence, she keeps you turning those pages, one after the other, in the correct order, with every sentence in every chapter being exponentially more interesting than the previous sentences in the previous chapters. she'll have you, by the very last words, being so excited by this tour-de-force of a novel that, more than likely, you'll end up exploding, gleeful little bits of you plastering the walls behind the sofa in your living room.  or your bedroom, depending on where you like to read.  conveniently, most hardcover copies of this novel come with not only a mop, but also a bucket."  - larry childs, the washington post  "i hated it.  but the mop worked nicely."  - yolanda salizar, the miami herald  "poetic and heartwrenchingly beautiful, this book- no, this work of ART- made me weep so hard that my eyeballs fell out.  yet that didn't stop me from reading the whole thing.  the ending was such a surprise that it kept me awake for months afterwards; i lay on my futon and just kept repeating, 'how the fuck was that possible?'  i mean, really, how the fuck was that possible?  out of nowhere, this team of super-brilliant roller skating monkeys just kind of appear in their spacecraft, no warning, no foreshadowing, nothing, and they save the day, just like that.  i suppose it takes a brilliant author such as ms. jarrucci to make that happen without having everyone question how the fuck it was possible.  wait a minute.  anyways, it was great."  - "ferclyn's" dad, the ferclyn's dad tribune  "it took me nine years to write this book, and i think it's the most humorous piece of crap that $12.99 will afford you.  and, no, my dad does not sleep on a futon."  - ferclyn jarrucci

       and now i know that there are at least two things to do in the city of milwaukee- go to the milwaukee art museum and go to a brewers' game.  i enjoyed the milwaukee art museum although of course it was no art institute or, of course, no met.  (sidenote:  since i've been to the met, i can't stop making references to the fact that i have and that having spent three hours there last october, i am now way cooler than anyone who hasn't.  or who has spent only two hours or one.  so bear with me.)  the thing i did like was that they had a "chair park," all sorts of different styles of chairs arranged around an area.  you're welcome to sit in these chairs; on the way home that evening, i told chris that the chair park should have been called the "chair garden" and that their slogan should have been "plant your ass!"  now that's clever.  the brewers game was fun; it's weird how i can enjoy sitting at a baseball game but feel like tearing my hair out if i have to watch it on tv.  must be the alcohol.  the milwaukee art museum:

       i can't use a public toilet without covering the entire seat with 3 to 4 layers of toilet paper.  i don't know what sort of disease i'm afraid of getting, but i fear that if i don't take those protective measures, i'm going to end up one evening in a compromising position with my lover looking at the backs of my upper thighs and ass, saying, "how did you get this green and purple rash?"  and, he'll also remark, "i think your left butt cheek has fallen off- no wonder you looked so strange in your jeans."  i can't touch the flusher, i need to kick it with my shoe.  and i always take note of who's washing their hands and, more importantly, who isn't.  i went for coffee tonight with shane and took home the coffee mug.  i stuck it in my purse and everything and  almost  took offense when shane compared me to grandmothers worldwide.  almost.  but let me just reiterate how nice this mug is.  and how overpriced my drink was.  i did the math and came up with one mug, my favor.  bam.  oh, the klepto in me can't wait for mini-golf season.  i'm going to have a crapload of putters lying around the bedroom, and more colored golf balls than i'll be able to count.  i'll be able to set up my own mini-golf place, call it "windmills and shit."  i'll just have to watch and make sure that no one steals my putters.  or my golf balls.  now that would be a bitch, probably wreck my day so much that i'd find myself on a public toilet without the aforementioned requisite covering of toilet paper.  and my scenario of the rash and lost left butt cheek? a vivid reality, and one much too scary to continue to write about.

       it's probably a good thing i'm transferring stores because i think that, if i weren't, i'd probably be getting written up left and right.  let's take today for instance.  * i was 81 minutes late for work.  through no fault of my own- because, no, it's not my fault i read the schedule wrong.  damn thing should be more... legible... or the font should be bigger.  * i forgot to place 3 orders before leaving work on tuesday, of which i was bruskly reminded today.  * once again, i violated the dress code.  i tend to wear shirts that show my belly, and not on purpose- it's just one of those things. i think i have an abnormally long torso.  * i was exceptionally rude to a woman who annoyed the piss out of me.  of her husband's lenses, she butted in, "you know, i have such and such lens, and when i bought them last week, they didn't cost nearly so much."  to which i responded, "oh, i doubt that.  hey, we're sitting in front of the computer, why don't we just pull your file up right now?"  then she was asking me which frames looked better on her husband, who had the kind of homely face that glasses weren't exactly going to make or break.  i replied, "i don't care, i'm not going home with him."  then there was more haggling on the price; bitch wanted to bargain.  to which i used my old fallback, "hey, this isn't swap-a-rama here."  (to those of you not from the southside, swap-a-rama's the flea market.  and, frankly, it's a damn good flea market.  best place around to get nintendo games.)  * excessive breaks.  * swearing within earshot of customers.  not that i'm the only one guilty of this; my favorite was when erika came to ask me for help once.  she was walking away from the customer and was no more than 1.5 yards away when she, obviously frustrated, said, quite clearly, "jackie help me out because i don't know what to do with this fucking guy."  ah, good times.  although, like i said, i do deserve to be written up- and yet, i seem untouchable, much like that tv show, "the untouchables."  instead, i get everyone saying, "gee, we're going to miss you."  it's like my departure overshadows my crummy work ethics somehow.  if i weren't going anywhere, i bet they'd say, "gee, you're really starting to toe the line here."  anyhow, speaking of erika, she invited me to go downtown clubbing tonight.  and i'm going- so that i can go to work hungover tomorrow.  didn't i tell you i deserved to be written up?  man oh man.  i love writing blog entries.  i told chris last night, i'd write six a day if i didn't think that would make me look like a gigantic loser.  i just can't help that i have so much to say.  even if what i have to say is oftentimes the same stuff i've had to say for weeks and weeks and weeks.  but, hey, you choose to read it.  not me.

       we signed the lease, ladies and germs.  our leasing consultant scares the crap out of me because she seems about as mentally stable as, oh, i don't know- something that's not very mentally stable at all.  sorry, it's early, and i'm just not feeling clever right now.  and not that there's anything wrong with lacking mental stability.  i myself have been known to be bawling one moment over some huge, heart-breaking situation (which, most of the time, i've made up) and then, the next moment, be laughing my ass off over the pronunciation of some random three syllable word.  like toboggan.  but the kind of mental stability this woman lacks?  she's going to forget who we are and then, in a fit of confusion, attempt to stab us with a twizzler.  but i jest.  she's just the kind of woman who gets extremely frazzled because the phone rings every once in a while.  yes, though, the lease is signed.    it all still amazes me, every moment.  i'm so damn lucky to have found someone that i love so much that, at this rate, maybe i should also buy more lotto tickets.  did i also mention we bought a queen sized bed?

       i grew up on a small farm in nebraska.  i had nine brothers and sisters, but unfortunately six of them perished due to an unfortunate incident regarding the ingestion of some topical cream.  that left me and my three sisters mabel, loretta "the nautical ninja" sue, and bernice.  we were very competitive, the four of us, and often had to be separated due to the kind of fights that resulted in entire handfuls of hair being yanked, and then torn, from our respective scalps.  i was the oldest, so i was told that i should have known better.  to this, i would respond, maturely, with my well-thought out response of "na-na-na-na-na-boo-boo."  i knew i had to get away from my sisters, who were wont to steal my prom dates, sabotage the many drafts of my novel, cut the brake lines of my chevy nova, and stir hearty dollops of topical cream into my morning cocoa while i was indisposed in the next room sticking needles into their lipsticks.  i talked to my parents, simple nebraska farm folks who didn't understand why the four of us felt the need to sleep with steak knives underneath our pillows.  "i need to leave," i told them.  "i cannot live this way!"  my father would look at me over the tops of his glasses, shake his head, and reply, "na-na-na-na-na-boo-boo.  now bale some hay."  i decided to make my get-away one night after loretta sue set my dog on fire.  i beat the flames out of rover with bernice's autographed copy of "the white album," and then turned to my three sisters and declared, "i'm afraid your fun is about to become 25% less... fun.  by morning, i'll be gone."  "empty threat," mabel scoffed as she spat in my hair.  but while they slept, i packed up my few belongings into one of those bundles tied to a stick, slung the stick over my shoulder, and headed, barefoot, towards the highway.  i was picked up by a truck driver who asked, "where ya headed?"  "new york, sir.  i'm trying to pursue my dreams of regentrifying harlem."  "hop in," he said.  i hopped in.  we drove all night, and i told him about my sisters.  he told me about his love of the anagram game.  "tipper gore," he said, "can be rearranged to spell 'ego tripper.'"  "or," i said, "'pee grip rot.''  "that's a good one."  we were in new york by morning.  he knew shortcuts like you wouldn't believe, and he dropped me off in front of a motel six (anagram: me slit ox), where i had to perform  numerous sexual favors in order to secure a room.  i also had to promise to make the coffee in the morning, but it was worth it- i was in new york!  i was finally away from my sisters, and i could use the bathroom without having to worry about somebody having laced the toilet seat with strains of syphilis.  yes, i had truly arrived... and i became bored as fuck.  it's the old, sad tale: without the constant threat of pranks and torture, my mind went feeble with inactivity.  sure, it wasn't easy to regentrify harlem, but i still felt like i needed a hobby of some sort.  and that, my friends, is why this small-town girl from nebraska decided to start a career in fashion design.  i made red the new pink.  and it wasn't easy.

       last night- after finishing my blog entry, in fact- jason picked me up and we headed into the city for some mediterranean cuisine.  two syllables for y'all: hum-mus.  also cous-cous, which is actually just a lot of fun to say and really no fun to eat.  i felt like i haven't been downtown in years.  i felt like a dog hanging its head out the window as we headed up lake shore drive, tongue panting with excitement as i took in the familiar, yet missed view.  it's been so long since i headed north into the city; the view from the south as you're arriving is really one of the best that chi-town has to offer.  when you're coming down from the north, you just kind of slip your way in, and you don't really notice the change.  but when you're on 90/94 heading up to 55 and lsd, the city looms magestically, unfolding like some kick-ass pop-up book.  it's enough to make somebody re-fall in love with chicago.  i myself fall in and out of love with chicago about four times a year, so fickle i am.  although i really do think my heart belongs to seattle, depression-inducing weather and all.  and vancouver?  ohh, just you wait.  i'm obsessed with cities.  i need to visit every single one before i die.  which sounds like it would be undoable, but maybe you haven't read my blog entry about living until 5494.  vancouver.  boston.  london.  sydney.  tokyo.  biloxi, for crying out loud.  i'm sure i'll see l.a. sometime in the next few years because of chris, although i must admit that the idea of l.a. does not seem to hold the magic that, say, san francisco did.  does.  i don't know.  like suddenly i'm an expert on california just because i spent four days in s.f.?  jeez, louise.  it's all that "full house" i used to watch.  and the fact that there's so many asians in san francisco.  there's also a lot of gays.  in fact, i've referred to the population as "gaysian," which, i'm sure, makes me as politically correct as they come.  but i love asian people.  and homosexuals, i like them, too-  but, let me assure you, in a very straight, heterosexual kind of way.  should i delete that paragraph or just go with it?  hmm.

       all in all, i'm feeling better.  the bad mood's subsiding, and today i'm happy.  i'm having one of those days where i feel like i'm in rare form, cracking jokes left and right, striking up conversations with perfect strangers, running around with endless amounts of energy, thinking up brilliant new designs for various candy dispensers, etc, etc.  although i did make a nasty phone call to my doctor, but i think, after all i've been through (sniff, sniff), she deserved it.  i woke up late this morning, approximately ten minutes before i had to be at work.  i ran into the kitchen, where my dad was doing dad things such as alphabetizing his mail, and cried, "i'm late, i'm late!"  immediately, he sprang into action.  "okay," he said, all serious-like and standing up so fast i thought he'd knock over his chair, "you take your shower and when you come out, i'll have your breakfast and coffee all ready."  which he did.  then, after said breakfast and coffee were consumed, i was heading out the door when he cried, "wait!  i made you a lunch," and then handed me a bag complete with sandwich, chilli, soda, banana, and cookies.  god love that man.  one generalization i think that's fair to make- when you have an italian parent, you'll never go hungry.  never!

       tickets for bob dylan went on sale today.  i think that's one concert i would have liked to gone to this summer, but alas the opportunity has come and gone.  sure, i could get tickets from a scalper, but who really has six hundred dollars these days to just throw around?  certainly not i, even with the hefty 4% raise i just recieved.  4%.  i haven't recieved a raise this low in the past two decades,  at least , and the sad thing is that i actually got the second highest raise in the store.  maybe i should persuade my patients to buy their eyewear elsewhere.  ... elsewhere eyewear... now that would be a good name for a store.  jeff had told me what seemed like years ago that tickets would be going on sale may 10.  and i said, "may 10?  christ, that's like forever and a day away."  and now may 10 is almost over.  i like to tell myself that time, it goes so slowly by, but when i stop to consider the facts, it really does seem to be exceeding its own speed limit.  and before i know it, i'll look at the calendar and say, "how the hell did it get to be august 13th... in the year 5494?  and how did i happen to live this long?"  then somebody will pop my hip back into its socket, remind me of that ridiculous deal i'd signed with the devil exchanging the completion of a few unholy quests for my own miserable, eternal immorality, and then position my head so that i can at least look out the window as to see the very last moments of galaxy war XII with the aliens from planet hollywood.  you know, the last moments in which everyone and everything else but me is destroyed, leaving me not only bitterly and painfully alone (and cold) but also with a hip that perpetually slips from its own damn socket and requires fingers NOT arthritic with which to replace it.  my own fingers, as you will imagine, will be extremely arthritic.  but i digress.  how did it get to be may 10?  and why didn't i just lay down the bucks and get me some bob dylan tickets?  because unless  he  signs some horrible deal with some horrible demon, he probably won't be around for that much longer, thus making it ever so important to see him now.  yeah, whatever.  i just want to go to a concert.

       time.com, in what the journalistic world would call a "fluff piece," states that what mom really wants this year for mother's day is a little time for herself.  done and done.  and i mean done.  hell, i'll even try to leave the house that morning without interrupting her "time" with so much as a "see ya!"   with mother's day approaching, i'm reminded of those tender mother/daugher scenes you often see on made-for-tv movies and commercials for wal-mart.  these clips that run through my head are in sharp contrast to the actual mother/daughter moments experienced in this here household.  even though, generally speaking, she's a pretty big wal-mart shopper.  so here comes the philosophical dilemma.  should even a token hallmark gift be deserved or just annually issued?  hell, despite the quandry, i know i'm going to end up getting her  something , but this is a purchase that, every year, kills a little bit more of me.  and one may, there's going to be nothing left of me, and i'm going to hand her whatever knick-knack piece of crap i got her for those last few moments of my life as i have known it, and i'm going to choke out, "the last bit of my soul is in there, you heartless bitch," and she's going to say, "well, the least you could have done is wrap it."  breathe in, then out.  in that order.  repeat.  i suppose we do have our moments, my mother and i.  like that time in 1980 when she squeezed me out of her, that was nice to finally get some air.  and she's made me countless tuna sandwiches, although she refuses to make me any kind of sandwich with cheese in it.  hey, she bought me a beer for my birthday last year, that was kind of cool.  most importantly, she's provided me with an extremely unique perspective of humanity- at the very least i can say and be relatively happy with  that .  and the problems that i  don't  hide from her?  after her eight days of nagging have come and gone, she'll usually try, in her own horrible way, to help.  so to the wal-mart i will go-  to buy her some crap.  although i wish, instead, we could just celebrate father's day  twice .  now there's a gift that's always deserved.

       blaine relates of his adventures in mount carroll- a town, he will tell you, that is located 15 miles southeast of galena.  the basic gist of the story is that a pack of 7 guys at the neighborhood bar wanted to kick his ass.  so he's running from the bar, with 7 guys running after him, and as he's running he falls and tumbles into some bushes, where he promptly blacks out for a period of about six hours.  i find this beyond humorous.  maybe you need to know blaine to get it.  maybe not.  this story was retold to me last night, and i laughed so hard that i spit out my drink and then nearly choked on some nachos.  maybe it's just the image of 7 mean, burly dudes chasing  blaine - well-dressed, pretty-boy, i-spend-forty-minutes-gelling-my-hair, my-parents-own-half-of-new-lenox blaine...  or maybe it's just the general idea of what it would be like to black out in some bushes.  either way.  i gotta go to work.

       nobody likes a poet.  it's true.  but everyone loves a clown.  even more people love a smart ass.  a smart ass clown would win lots of points in a popularity contest.  nobody likes an artist, the kind of artist that is deeply brooding and needs to mention the inherent beauty in, say, a broken tree branch or a bag of half eaten corn chips.  nobody likes that girl, even if her clothes are really fucking cool.  nobody likes a musician.  well, that's not true.  most people love musicians.  studies have been done proving that guys who play instruments get all the babes, and the guys who can't play any instruments are usually left with what's left over, which, if we're following, isn't much, because all the babes have already been taken. although i myself would rather date a smart ass clown than a musician, although i suppose it wouldn't hurt if he could bang out a good rhythm.  as far as being a musician myself, girls who rock are cool.  but no one would like me as a musician if (a) i played an un-sexy instrument such as the tuba or (b) i used my knowledge of music to sing along my poems.  because, remember, no one likes a poet.  nobody likes a devout christian.  except other devout christians.  but even they don't really get along; you can see it in their eyes.  devoutness can be as annoying as the statement, "isn't there so much beauty in that broken tree branch?"  nobody likes a person who writes pointless blog entries.  except for the blogger herself.  everybody likes the person who buys the drinks.  at least for the duration of the drink.  nobody likes the perfume lady at marshall fields.

       the nice thing about returning home after spending a few days at chris' is that i'll usually find that somebody's done my laundry for me.  i have 3 1/2 weeks of work left before the move.  wait for it, wait for it....  today i recieved an email from whole foods, where i suppose i had applied for a position.  the chick writing the email wanted to know if i was still interested in said position.  now if only i could remember what that job had entailed, then my response could have sounded a little more intelligent.  this situation already seems much like my interview for heartland blood centers.  the lady asked me, "why are you interested in this job?"  i replied, "to be honest, i've been applying for so many jobs that i can't remember what this one was."  sigh.  last night i dreamt that i was a character in a harry potter book.  my power was collecting, and mailing, greeting cards.  if i mailed you a greeting card, even if it was a nice one such as one that wished you and yours a happy anniversary or a festive cinco de mayo, you would inevitably die.  your internal organs would shrivel up, your eyeballs would fall from their sockets, and the blood in your veins would become a form of mango juice.  i only mailed out one greeting card in my dream, and that one was an innocent mistake.  innocent.  no, really.  yesterday, i spent one dollar on an instant win lotto ticket.  i won four dollars.  i spent the four dollars on four more tickets.  i won six dollars.  i spent the six dollars on six more tickets.  i won two free tickets.  i said to the guy behind the counter, "at this rate, i could be here all day."  he was not amused, and on the last two tickets, i did not win a thing.  all i had done was managed to waste that poor cashier's time- and, in the end, isn't that truly what it's all about?  it was worth a buck.  but next time i'll have the foresight to stop when i'm ahead, take my five dollars, and celebrate with a whopper or something.

       i had this killer cupcake recipe in mind for my upcoming "bring your own cupcakes" party, but i couldn't make them because i was unable to find the requisite 9 1/2 caterpillars.  and the donkey blood, the grocery store was out of that as well.  so no cupcake party.  i'd really like to go to a party sometime soon, or possibly have one thrown in my honor.  gail just bought a picnic basket, because lord knows you can't go on a picnic without first spending fifty bucks on a goddamn basket.  so maybe we'll go on a picnic sometime, and that will be *like* a party, only quite possibly no fun at all.  bugs tend to ruin picnics.  and rain, too.  also, other picnic-goers.  although if i do spend some time sitting on a blanket in the grass, i may come across my 9.5 caterpillars.  in which case, the cupcake party is on.

       the kitchen is full of shit.  no, literally.  i opened up the freezer a little bit ago in search of food, and i came across a stool sample in a clear and precisely labeled container.  immediately, i freaked out.  "who took a dump in the freezer?"  i screamed.  then i looked up; on top of the refrigerator, there were three  more  containers.  of crap.  my sister's been having infections and stomach problems, so the doctor requested these samples.  this alone freaks me out; doctors wouldn't make you collect your own feces just for the hell of it, would they?  unless they feared something major?  my sister said that, among other things, they're going to test for stomach cancer.  dear holy god.  dear. holy. god.  so i'm trying to make light of this despite being a little worried.  what's the punchline here?  oh man.  when there's poop in the freezer right next to the frozen pizzas, what *isn't* the punchline? this stuff writes itself.  everything's going to be fine.

       if you read this, jason- happy birthday.  the other night, jason and i met up for coffee after i got off work, and he said, "sorry, jackie, but my birthday plans include dan's brother and dan, so we didn't invite you, and..." and then he let it trail off like that.  it's funny that it even had to be said.  i thought some things were just too obvious to talk about.  in a lot of ways, i have assumed, without mentioning it, that i don't even exist to that group anymore- like most of them have buried me, said their last words (both nice and not-so-nice), and have then happily gotten on with it.  anyhow, it did kind of bothered me that he even brought that up, because i wouldn't have thought twice about it otherwise.  but once it was spoken, then i had to actually ingest it, think about it.  well, either way.

       i won the illinois state lottery.  it was truly against all odds, because not only did i pick my favorite numbers, but also my favorite letters and a few of my favorite colors.  i'll be on tv tomorrow night accepting the giant check, and hopefully the television station will let me say a few words.  maybe they'll ask, "what do you plan to do with all of this money?"  and i can answer, "i was thinking about giving it to charity.  but i'll probably just buy a car."  wow, what am i going to do with all this money?  it's 64 million, to be paid in one lump sum.  i'm sure i'll invest at least $100 of it, but then what?  obviously, i buy a house.  i get a couple of cars, take a few year's worth of fancy shmancy vacations (the kind that include cabana boys), acquire a whole shit load of toys and shoes.  i buy my gentleman caller every single piece of crap he could possibly want and then some.  like a go-kart track and six go-karts, all to be kept out by the pool.  i never work again.  i study art under famous artists, play sports with famous athletes, wine and dine with sexy celebrities, and become politically active, but only so i can have access to the button maker.   jackie for president or bust!   oh, the things that money will buy!  so, this is a nice turn of events.  i was going to  make  some hot dogs for lunch, but since we're talking about 64 million- i think i'm going to  order out  some hot dogs for lunch.  ah, this is the life.

        Your memory is a monster; you forgetit doesnt. It simply files things away. It keep things for you, or hides things from youand summons them to your recall with a will of its own. You think you have a memory; but it has you!  - from "a prayer for owen meany"  what a sad, beautiful book.  i've noticed this about other john irving books (by this i mean, the only other one i've read, being "the world according to garp"):  they start out slow and full of seemingly insignificant details, but, when the shit starts to happen, let me tell you that the shit starts to happen.  read the last part of that sentence with extra emphasis.  every tiny paragraph of "owen meany," especially the ones that you thought were just filler, is suddenly vital to the integrity of the story.  i find it absolutely amazing how that works out, because not every writer can do that.  if i ever write a book, a whole bunch of nonsense is going to happen and then, out of nowhere, everyone will be maimed by the butler, who will not even be mentioned until you read the words, "then everyone was maimed by the buter."  it will befuddle you.  of course, now i've just given away the ending of my novel, so maybe i should turn the butler into a dinosaur.  a court jester.  a crazy, one-eyed chef from lincoln, nebraska, who has a habit of adding extra vanilla to everything.  i guess it really won't matter much.  who am i kidding anyhow?  all i have so far for "my novel" is a bunch of random names and cities scrawled on a wad of cocktail napkins in pink lipstick.  but at least i've stapled the napkins together.  the thing that got me thinking after finishing "owen meany" has to do with the quote above, and how everything "came together" in the end.  my thought is- at the end of my life, is every little piece of bullshit going to suddenly come full circle?  boy, would that be a trip.  not to mention one very crowded hospital room.  i can tell you right now which icon from my past would probably end up stepping on my life support cord.  and which other one would ask to eat my jell-o.  if the past *is* an indication, i can tell you that a car ride will be my undoing.  it won't be a car crash that will kill me, but it'll be something that happens in a car.   like maybe i somehow catch on fire from a spark that jumps out of my cd player, landing unfortunately on my very flammable pants or in my hair-spray coated hair.  not that i use hair spray all that often, but this day will surely be an exception because of the hair spray and yogurt convention i will be driving to as a part of my parole agreement.  or, maybe, a rabid dog will jump into my open car window while i'm stopped at a toll booth psychotically counting out my forty pennies, and ... no, the dog won't bite me, that would be too obvious.  the rabid dog would have to somehow stab me with a letter opener that he had recently acquired from a mail order company operating out of memphis.  trust me, memphis makes sense.  it would be a small dog.  a cute one, in a goddamn sweater.

       i'm about to leave to go buy a gift for a shower.  this means dealing with gift registry, which makes us suckers think that this whole shopping and purchasing thing is really just more of a fun, wacky kind of scavenger hunt.  suckers.  i've decided that  i'm  going to register for some stuff.  now i know i'm neither engaged or pregnant, but why can't i too share in the joy of receiving?  i guess that's what the amazon wishlist is for.... but i'm also interested in tennis shoes and board games and chocolate covered almonds, so i may have to pick a few varied stores for this registry of mine.  oh how fun.  then i'm going to throw a shower for myself- not a bridal or baby shower, but a "did you buy me all the stuff i registered for?" shower.  it'll be a good time; i hope you will all come bearing gifts.  hot dogs may be served- possibly.  it's going to be all about the profit margin, so unless i get a good deal at costco, the shower may be byob...af.  bring your own beer... and food.  ah, yes.  then i wonder why i can count the number of friends i have on one lone hand.   i guess it's just as well; i need the other hand for flicking everyone else off.  good times.

       for those of you who missed last month's episodes, our heroine jackie was having a bit of trouble sleeping.  by "a bit of trouble," i mean "absolutely none and i was almost suicidal about it."  now here we are about to enter july, and i'm sleeping like a baby.  the only problem is that this baby is not like your average baby.  sure, there are the obvious differences, such as the fact that i'm 5'8" and have a license to operate an automobile, but also unlike your average baby, i'm having nightmares.  i'm assuming most babies don't have nightmares because what could they possibly have nightmares *about*?  too much milk?  the diaper that got wetter and wetter?  the animals in their hanging mobiles coming to life and suffocating them in their sleep with their life-size winnier the pooh bears?  oh my.  maybe i just proved myself wrong.  my nightmares are not your run of the mill nightmares.  no monsters.  no being naked in public.  no dreams of falling or being chased.  i have three themes in my dreams.  one, pregnancy.  oftentimes, i'll dream that i'm having a baby, and it's usually not even a real baby.  once, it was a rat.  another time, a doll.  a third time, a fully grown man that i was strangely attracted to.  the second theme is not graduating high school.  i'm always back at my old high school, i'm always taking classes too hard for me, and inevitably, i'm always being told, "you don't have enough credits, you're not going to graduate."  i'll wake up and think i'm still seventeen, lying there in bed and trying to figure out how many extra credit projects i'll need to get done by monday.  now, i was always an honor student.... except for my last semester in high school when i failed calculus.  failed.  but it was calculus, which was really hard, so even a failing grade in it is still better than your average american high school student, yes?  oh, it was so confusing.  anyhow, my third dream theme is time travel.  you would think this would sound fun, whimsical even.  the thing is, i'm constantly getting *stuck* in other times, with no way of finding my way back to the present.  the strangest thing about this dream, though, is that it usually takes place in a mall.  like, it'll be present day at one end of the mall, but once i enter sears or something, suddenly it's 1956.  i don't know why malls are always involved.  maybe it's just a commentary on my spending habits.  but the amount of sleep i'm getting these days, dreams aside, is pretty damn exciting.  i'm looking forward to new things on the horizon- a well-rest girl can move mountains, i hear.  or at least look at pictures of them.  without feeling cranky and drowsy.  and that's a plus.

       whoever thought up the idea of fortune cookies is my personal hero.   also, the magic eight ball guy.  and the guy at the cheez-it company who said to the other cheez-it guys- "hey!  let's package TWO bags of cheez-its inside ONE box!  because people eat a lot of cheez-its."  he was right, you know.  oh, how he was right.  i think a great job would be to write fortune cookie fortunes.  i think that while it might also be fun to write the replies for the magic eight ball, i fear all of mine would be much too lengthy to fit on that way-too-tiny triangular surface.  also, i'd probably end up ingesting magic eight ball juice somehow, and then i'd have to have my stomach pumped.  i'd probably also have to have my stomach pumped if i worked at the cheez-it factory.  because while i have been eating a lot of cheez-its lately, i've also started getting the impression that my intestinal lining is starting to decay,  just a little bit.  and that's no good.  certain things just aren't covered under your average hmo.

       what a hot, sticky day.  this morning i woke up at the insane hour (and equally insane minute) of 7:45 and headed to the old homestead, la casa de mi familia.  i had lunch plans with girls from work (where i *used* to work, sigh) but thought that i would spend the morning with my dad first.  so i got home, my dad and i talked for about twenty minutes, and then i spent the rest of the time playing on the internet, doing laundry, soaking up the cable tv, and burning cds.  talk about your quality family time.  lunch was with val and nikki.  val's a character; if there's more than a four second silence, she says, "boy, wasn't that awkward."  she talks.  a lot.  she works out every decision, even the tiniest ones, out loud.  like what she's going to order.  where she's going to place her fork.  how she's going to light her cigarette.  you would think this would be highly annoying; i love it.  her chatter's the most refreshing thing since sliced bread.  although i suppose sliced bread alone isn't that refreshing- maybe sliced bread paired with a chilled leinenkugel's?  a snoopy-machine icee?  you get the picture.  of course i had to make my day complete by visiting my old store before heading "home."  today i actually thought of the apartment as home.  i was wondering how long it would take, and i guess the answer's just under three weeks, like the gestation period of a chicken. true fact.  anyhow, how can the apartment *not* be home- all of my shoes are here.?  the old store is chugging along without me, as i knew would eventually happen.  i was afraid i would walk in and nobody would even care.  i am, after all, yesterday's pudding- whatever the fuck that means.  but i was wrong, alas.  i was greeted in one of the best ways possible; i was lifted from the floor and spun around by my favorite lab technician and former smoking partner.  he told me to transfer back to the store and compared me to the kinds of giant cookies you get from a really nice bakery.  "everyone else is just tollhouse," he said.  i'm hoping this train of thought catches on; "cookie" wouldn't be a half bad nickname to possess.  i can't tell you how much that made my day.  but i guess i did, since it ranked important enough to blog about.  i guess if we're using *that* scale, though, to rank importance, i'm probably fucked.  i believe i've written entire entries about mascara.  news to lebowskifest goers- time is drawing near.  the "dudes" sent me their newsletter today.  everyone is quite excited, and i guess there's going to be a costume contest.  how hard, though, can it be to dress like the dude?  my lord.  i'm thinking of gaining two hundred pounds and going as walter- i have access, don't-you-know, to the necessary lens tints i would require for walter's yellow shooting ones.  not to mention the aviator frames.  it's like i'm halfway there.  kind of.  shut the fuck up, jackie.

       i'm a big fan of things mechanical.  like those doors at the grocery store that open when you walk up to them, via the great technology of sensors? oh man.  sometimes on my break, i'll just walk up and down the strip mall making doors open and giggling wildly.  today i found, in the break room, a candy machine in which the candy bars will spin around if you press down a button that says "rotate selections."  so now whenever i go back there, i have to press down that button.  have to.  the noise itself is quite satisfying.  whirrrrrr.

       chris drinks soda before going to bed.  he drinks soda *in* bed, and while i find this absolutely adorable, i am unable to explain why.  it's generic soda (costco's "simply cola") and he, while slurping rather casually away, states in a serious tone, "this stuff's much better than either coke  or  pepsi."  i find this assessment extremely funny, but again i can't explain why.  what kind of wierdo drinks a can of soda in bed?  while naked?  before falling promptly asleep?  maybe i'm the wierdo for being so hung up on this image, but today all i could do was think about it and laugh.  you get a lot of queer looks when you're standing by yourself trying to disguise uncontrollable giggles as uncontrollable coughs or an uncontrollable, perhaps unidentifiable, type of half sneeze, half belch.  trust me, i know.  i don't think i've mentioned my Project on this blog, which is a shame because i think that if i did, i'd end up with some pretty cool results.  basically, my Project is the collection of t-shirts from different cities... small, little kid t-shirts as to show off my sizely (cough, cough, cough, choke) rack... that say, as an example, "somebody in las vegas loves me."  "someone in san francisco loves me."  "somebody who loves me a lot went to wisconsin and got me this t-shirt."  you get the picture.  those are the shirts i have now: las vegas, sf, and wisconsin (which isn't a city, i know, but work with me here), and my ultimate goal is to have one of those shirts from every possible city in the entire world.  what a wardrobe!!  i had to buy the first three myself.  which works out fine, because if you don't have self-love, what do you have... and, yes, the joke is funnier when you buy those types of t-shirts for yourself, so i guess it works out.  carole needs to bring me one of those from new york when she comes home next to visit, but it can't be one of those "i (heart) ny" t-shirts, otherwise i'll punch her.  however, if anybody else is traveling or comes across any of those t-shirts from any other city (other than chicago, because everyone here thinks i'm an asshole), please contact me and i will give you my mailing address and the correct reimbursement for both the t-shirt and the postage.  kids sizes 14-16, possibly 12, please.  and the cheaper the t-shirt, the better.  i don't like wearing things that look too nice, it makes me feel like i need to apologize.  the funnier a city sounds, the better.

       the book i've been reading for about five or six weeks now is "a prayer for owen meany" by john irving.  i'm about halfway through.  at this rate, it'll be september before i finish, which means that it will take me an entire summer to read one (1) novel.  and that's just horrible.  once in high school, somebody i knew told me that it was their goal to read three books over the summer break.  to this i scoffed,  "three books?  i'll have three books read by the end of the second week, you jackass.  what are you, illiterate?"  now i'm not so smug.  i read this book on a recommendation.  a boy i was on a date with found it odd that i wrote in all capital letters (which i only do sometimes) while my emails were all in lower case letters (which i do all the time, much to the dismay of prospective employers i'm sure).  he said, "that's odd how you do that.... ever read 'a prayer for owen meany?'"  "no."  "well, you should."  and that was the end of that.  no plot summary, nothing.  the only reason he recommended it, i can see now, is that whenever owen speaks or writes, it's all in capital letters.  did this guy really think that i would identify with this character for that one reason alone?  what a freak.  i'm nothing like owen meany.  i never killed my best friend's mother by slamming a baseball into her forehead.  never.  it was a soccer ball, and it was the mother of a girl i hardly knew.  so there.  when i was in sixth grade, i wrote down the title of every book i read for an entire year.  by the end of the year, i had read an average of about 1.2 books a day.  no joke.  most of them weren't even picture books.  and here i am taking three months to read one lousy novel.  not to mention i keep forgetting key plot points.  i think after i finish this book, i'm going to have to pick up something nice and thin, like a single o'henry story.  that'll boost this year's average for sure.  this is truly the dorkiest blog entry i have ever written.  but is it the dorkiest blog entry i have YET to write?  probably not.

       today my domestic partner and i got a membership at the local costco, which was either the stupidest or possibly smartest thing we've ever done.  possibly stupidest. my domestic partner seems to think that as long as we keep eating at the costco cafeteria, where you can get a huge hot dog and 20 oz coke (free refills) for $1.50, the $45 membership fee will be more than worth it.  in my office (read: corona box on kitchen floor), there are currently 24 bottles of gatorade, 48 ice cream sandwiches, 12 rolls of paper towels, and all sorts of other food items that are surely going to go bad before any sort of sizable dent can be incurred.  also, i have a feeling that with the number of sandwich bags we bought, i'm going to end up bequeathing most of them to my grandchildren.  ri-goddam-diculous.  you know you've skipped some vital part of your life when you wake up one day and find yourself signing up for a costco membership at the age of 22.  something about it just doesn't seem right.  also, the fact that you can buy 1450 q-tips at one time.... that, in fact, if you're at costco, you pretty much HAVE to.  what's happened to me?  some days, i feel like a gigantic loser.  this is one of those days.  i don't think it's because of the fact i had a hard time lifting my lifetime supply of toilet paper into the shopping cart.  i think it's because of this dream i had last night.  all this great shit was happening to me in this dream- i was living in a water park / go kart park- and then somebody asked me who i was and what i did.  and i told them the answer.  i sold glasses.  and i hated having to say that.  i woke up and realized that something has got to change, and soon.  i don't want to waste my life working some menial job that will never get me anywhere.  really, any job at all will be menial, i'm quite sure of it.... but there's got to be some other way.  i want to do something that makes me insanely happy.  i know what this something is.... but i'm so weak, i'm so afraid of being mediocre, of failing miserably.... so i stop myself before i can hardly begin.  this is not who i want to be.  some religions say you get a whole shit load of lives.  if i believed that, then i'd say, "i was probably fabulous in my previous lives, so i can be kind of boring now....." but that's not what i believe.  this is it, my one chance.  and even though i'm young, i'm still kind of blowing it.  sigh.  i can always find something to complain about.   usually it's men.  lately, i'm having trouble complaining about men.... so again it comes back to me.  i'm such the stereotypical woman, always taking care of my romantic needs first and then worrying about the rest.  funny, huh?  oh well, we're all fucked up somehow.  at costco, it's impossible to buy just one loaf of bread.

       last night was board game night- chris, ocean, jordan, kim, and i sat around the dining room table, drank beer from a gigantic glass boot, and tried to tackle the mystery and intrigue that is "castle of magic."  my vote was for "scrabble," but my vote never seems to count for much when chris has the chance to be a wizard of some sort.  it was kind of cool, once i got the hang of it.  of course it took me forever to get the hang of it.  i think we should all invest in a few less complicated games- but not "mouse trap," because i could never quite get the hang of that one either.  i used to like playing "the babysitter's club game" a lot when i was about ten.  the trivia questions were way too easy, though- i mean, everyone knows that it's claudia that likes art, mallory who has a hundred siblings, and jesse who's the token black girl.  those young adult writers, they understand the importance of having a token everything.  i love playing board games.  i'd rather play a board game than a computer game, and, going back to when i was ten, i was quite convinced that what i wanted to do when i grew up was to design board games.  i actually made a huge board game about the size of our dining room that had the layout of a streetfront, with different buildings.  the object of the game was to catch the robber, steal back the money he had stolen originally, and then return it to its rightful store.  i thought it was a lot of fun, but i think if i were to redo that game now, it would be like, first you catch the robber, then you steal back the money, then you buy a whole bunch of string cheese.  then you take a gulp from the beer in the boot.  i also wanted to be an astronaut.  a detective.  a teacher.  a writer.  a fashion designer.  a senator.  instead, i grew up to adjust glasses.  oh, how cruel life can be sometimes.  my character in the game last night was the former king of some country that had already been assisinated once and was therefore unable to be assasinated ever again. i was immortal.  immortal, i tell you.   and i was mad with power.  before we all got bored and gave up.

       oye!!  i'm sitting on the floor of the kitchen typing with my laptop on a corona box because for now all we have is dial-up and, of course, this is the only phone jack in the apartment that works.  this is how the impoverished must feel, the ones that have computers...   the more things change, the more they stay the same.    i'm not quite sure what i'm trying to say with that cliche, but except for moving in with my boyfriend, switching jobs, leaving my hometown an hour behind, and dying my hair a slight burgundy color, not much else is going on.  i kind of hate my job.  not that i hate it, but i just don't like it very much.   remember how in "being john malkovich" all those old people wanted a younger vessel to take over so that they wouldn't have to grow even older and eventually die?  i'm the young vessel, and my co-workers are the old people.  i can see them planning the take-over- it's in the lines around their eyes, spelled out in the grey strands of their hair.  it's in the way they shuffle around rather slowly.  after a while, i won't be me anymore.  i'll be fifteen old ladies.  at least maybe i'll know how to knit.  and bake, let's not forget that i've been meaning to bake.  i exaggerate.  i tend to do that.  everyone is quite nice, and since i too am quite nice, we all get along grandly.  since i don't have children in their twenties, though, or the onset of arthritis, we don't necessarily have a lot to discuss.  i miss the shenanigans of my old store, the gossip and the drinking and the fun.  i need shenanigans.  baby boomers and their predecessors don't seem to crave shenanigans.  the apartment is relatively great.  it has its problems, such as the phone jack situation i described in paragraph one, and the roaches, and the fact that the people above us sound like elephants when they walk around, but it's a lot of space, and it's starting to feel like home.  i like my roommates.  i like sleeping next to chris- strangled snoring and all.  i like ... well, listing my likes is never interesting.  maybe i should go back to complaining.  now that i'm online again, i'm going to call my mother and tell her... that i'm still not online.  because she's a fan of writing me emails that read like grocery lists, except instead of listing things like milk, eggs, and cheese, they list things like, "make sure you don't break any legs," and "brush your teeth," and "practice safe sex because if we find out that you're giving birth to any bastard children, we'll drive up there and drown them in the nearest river."  typical mom stuff.  only with more spelling errors.  i've forgotten how to blog.  i'll be back.

       the new apartment, which is large and currently cluttered with boxes and mismatched furniture, will not be equipped with internet access until next week.  which is truly a death sentence for the likes of jackie.  i'm at chris' parents right now using their computer; "saved by the bell" is on the tv behind me and my stomach is full of cocoa puffs.  so i guess all's not bad.  detailed blog entries to come.  and moving anecdotes, let's not forget the moving anecdotes.

       and in sports, i am officially sick of hearing about sammy sosa and his stupid corked bat.  this is bigger news than the what-have-you going on in iraq.  fox interrupted "that seventies show" today with a special sammy sosa corked bat announcement.  interrupted.  as if a little cork in a goddamn bat is more important than key plot points of a moderately acclaimed rerun.  i played softball for a brief period in my youth.  the year was 1991.  "home alone" was a run-away hit, and the clarence thomas/ anita hill hearings had even the fifth graders cracking low brow sexual harrassment jokes.  like the one where clarence tells anita he wants to keep her on his  staff  for a very long time?  whoo-ya!  surely, that wasn't the best one, but so much time has passed that the juicy ones have been stuffed back into my subconscious.  returning to my story, competition was becoming very heated at ye olde "girls ages 10-11" softball field, and i knew i had to do something to re-earn the respect of my peers, whose respect i had previously, and repeatedly, lost due to poor performance in the batter's box.  that and there had been several unfortunate incidents resulting in a few of their dogs dying and me for some reason having to shoulder the blame.  let's not get into it.  what's important is that the pressure was on.  i knew i wasn't going to become a great batter overnight, or even over an extended period of time filled with lots of training and practicing, so what i decided to do was cork my bat.  i don't know how i got caught.  maybe it was my sneaky, shifty eyes.  my profuse sweating on sixty-five degree days.  or maybe it was because my method of corking was to simply tape a few wine corks to the tip of my bat.  whatever it was that gave me away, i was ejected from that game and then ridiculed for what seemed like minutes.  anyhow, my point of this story is that while it was a big deal for the duration of that one game, my bat corking incident certainly did not interrupt "that seventies show."  so let's get over this sammy sosa crap and move on, shall we?

       i'm typing this blog entry on my new lap top, freshly purchased from the good people at best buy.  boy, are those best buy dudes pushy- extended warranty this and payment plan that.  just give me my goddamn lap top already.  i think it was incredibly smart of me to spend over a grand on a lap top what with now also having to pay rent and fully support myself on a job that, while not exactly crappy, sure as hell isn't great.  don't you?

       i am addicted to the television, which is unfortunate, because here i am stuck without a television.  not that i can lay on the couch for hours on end watching mindless game shows and reruns of my favorite sitcoms (remember "news radio," everybody?), but i just like to have it *on* while i go about my morning/afternoon.  even if i'm using the computer, i want the tv on.  even if i'm totally busy constructing a log cabin out of popsicle sticks (which would require the consumption of alot of popsicles, mmm rocket pops), i want the tv on, as a friendly presence in the background.  i'm sure this is a sickness of sorts, but i was raised by the tv and i find it to be a comfort.  and i'm a little sad that i can't turn it on.  i could put a movie in, i suppose, but movies aren't the same.  i need comedy central, or a news broadcast, or even "the facts of life."  no, who am i kidding, i hated "the facts of life."  but remember when tbs was rerunning "parker lewis can't lose?"  oh, good times.  when i was little, i'd make tv's out of big cardboard boxes, like the sort you'd find a washing machine in.  i got the idea from the "muppet babies."  and my sister and i would put on our own shows, only our own shows were very limited in action because there's only so much moving you can do in a cardboard box.  mostly, we aired the noon o'clock news.  "this just in, i want ice cream."  chris and ocean are at work, and i'm in their apartment.  a few more days, and we'll all be in *our* apartment.  but until then, i have no ownership of this space that i am inhabiting.  which is why i think it would be awfully funny if i rearranged all their furniture and maybe taped a whole lot of shit to their walls.  like portraits of richard nixon, they'd like that.  or perhaps i'll just nail all of my socks to their walls- yeah, that would be pretty random, and i'm sure everyone involved would get quite the kick out of it.  i sure would- of course it would be a sock-less kick, but there's no rule saying you need socks on to kick.  am i right?  am i right?  i wonder if "spongebob" is on.

       my "surprise" going away party was last night.  a good time was had by all.  i'm going to miss my co-workers quite badly.  who grows this attached to their coworkers?  you'd think i was leaving behind my family.  speaking of leaving behind my family- except for the pillows i forgot in my bedroom, i'm officially moved out.  i have to go back and clean up the incredible mess i left in my wake (23 years worth of junk and gunk) but other than that, i'm gone.  we left this morning/afternoon while both of my parents were still at work.  i'm a horrible, horrible daughter for not saying a proper good-bye.  horrible.  my mother called my cell phone just as we were getting off the highway.  and she was crying, saying that she loved me and was going to miss me, asking if *she* was the reason i was moving.  we've never had a good relationship, and it's not an odd question, even though i know it sounds odd.  no, mom, you're not the reason i'm moving.  i looked over while talking to her and saw the reason i was moving; he was sitting next to me in the car.  the only real apprehension i have about this move is the whole switching jobs part.  i wish my store could have transplanted itself here in town.  i'm going to be the youngest person in this new store, by, it appears, a good ten or fifteen years.  oh well, i hear the elderly have a lot of wisdom to share.

       i'm at chris' apartment right now, which is basically like being right in the middle of mexico.  not  new  mexico the state but mexico, the actual country which you would pronounce "meh-he-co," turning the x into a j which sounds more like an h.  not that i have a huge problem with being in mexico, but i'm rather hoping the new apartment complex will resemble more  new  mexico the state than mexico the country, if you get my drift.  because, not being mexican, i feel a bit out of my element.  everywhere i look, there's somebody wearing a sombrero while blaring mariachi music.  it's aggravating, and i can't explain why without sounding like some sort of a racist.  and i'm not a racist.  i just don't like being around so many mexicans- this despite that fact that i'm italian and, if cast in a movie, could easily play the mexican heroine.  i've even got the "j sounds like h" part down pat.  i really just think it's all that mariachi music.  and when i walk past a group of them who are looking at me and speaking rapid spanish- oh, certainly they're discussing how bad of a hair day i may be having.  and that's kind of rude.  here's what just happened, though.  i'm sitting here kind of bored and hungry and i hear the delightful bells of what sounds like an ice cream truck.  thinking, "sweet, i want a rocket pop," i run outside on the balcony.  no ice cream truck in sight.  instead, there's a mexican man, in a sombrero, pulling around a little cooler on wheels and ringing a set of bells.  i'm not buying ice cream out of some dude's cooler.  i highly doubt his ice cream has been approved by the state board of health, not to mention i'm sure he's lacking any requisite licensing he would surely need.  i also know that there have been several knocks at the door here at the apartment by a man (maybe not in a sombrero, although it's likely he owns one) selling homemade tamales.  not going to buy.  sorry, maybe it's just me, but i like my mexican food pre-packaged and completely americanized by, say, the good people at taco bell.  or chipotle.  or, really, i do love authentic mexican food- but only when it's sold in a RESTAURANT.  these independent, free-lance contractors selling the crap they concocted earlier that day in their kitchen, or bathtub, or who knows where- it just doesn't seem kosher.  oh, how horrible this all makes me sound.  but i don't care.  much.  the complex we're moving into has a very early colonial virginia kind of feel to it- maybe our neighbors will instead sell homegrown tobacco.  which would actually be an entirely different situation altogether.  something to think about, i suppose.  the song i'm taking credit for writing today is van morrison's "moondance."  i mean, jackie's "moondance."  it's a marvelous night, wouldn't you say?

       at which point i said, "you take your color copiers and your fancy shmancy sales pitch and shove them up your-"  uh oh.  ever notice that you often light up in front of giant tanks of propane gas labeled "highly flammable?"  they should really make those signs more visible.  also, they should include illustrations of surprised italian girls being engulfed by the kinds of flames that only get bigger as you try to put them out.  as to make the warnings a little bit clearer.  our walls are bare.  i'm thinking of taping up some mustard labels, a la warhol.  i think we only have one container of mustard, though.  so i guess by "some," i meant "a."  my birthday is wednesday.  i'm scheduled to work.  i have a wedding to go to next saturday.  again, scheduled to work.  this after specifically requesting both days off.  what's the deal here?  it's like i'm writing my requests in sanskrit.  laughable, man.  just laughable.  i got three bills in the mail today, a day after paying rent.  speaking of laughable.... i hope that pyramid scheme pays off sometime soon.

        this entry sponsored by minolta   i interviewed with them today.  they want me to sell copiers.  color copiers, black and white copiers... copiers that copy in both color and black and white... everybody needs a copier, right?  how hard could this be?  "hi, my name is jackie, and i'm here to simplify your copying needs.  now, sir or madam, do you prefer color or black and white?"  "this is a private residence."  short silence.  "everybody needs a copier.  especially if you're running a scam of some sort, say, out of your basement.  a scam that requires copying foreign currency and social security cards for uses of forgery and maybe identity theft.  sign here."  i don't think this is for me.  not the selling part, because i bet i could be good at it, but the part where you work 11 hours a day, five days a week, in your first six months in order to train.  you heard me.  that's a shitload of hours.     24 hours per day -  11 hours per day at work -   6.5 hours per night sleeping --------------------------------------    6.5 hours of jackie time  most of that time being taken up by bodily functions and traffic and choosing between the black pants or the grey ones.   i don't want the kind of job that becomes your entire life.  what's the point of making money if you've no time to spend it?  that's my motto.  also, "he who smelt it may not have necessarily dealt it."  but we'll see.  my mind is rarely *completely* made up.  it's like that big wheel in "the price is right."  you think it's on the 80 cent mark, and then it slowly ticks back over to the 30 cent mark.  you don't know whether to laugh or cry.  and why the hell did you price the can of peas at sixteen dollars to begin with?  sixteen dollars!! that's exorbitant for peas.  minolta.  brent lent me a minolta camera, and i am oh so anxious to persue my dreams of becoming a wildly successful photo-journalist, hopefully overnight.  my artistic dreams have been rekindled- i just hope i don't break it on him.  or lose it.  or trade it for a handful of gum.  ah, but i jest.  i'm sure it's worth at least *two* handfuls of gum.  seriously, brent- thanks for entrusting your camera in me.  i'm tired.  i didn't sleep at all last nigt, and every time i woke up, i felt it was necessary for me to roll over and whack chris across the chest with my arm.  and ask him what time it was.  and demand him to pass me my bottle of water.  and complain to his half-listening ear, "i can't sleep at all!  hey, wake up.  i said i can't sleep!"  girlfriend of the year.  first i threaten to leave him behind at gencon, and then we get back and i don't let him sleep.  somebody should photo-copy me a medal.

       chris and i are spending the night in lafayette, indiana, which sounds, quite frankly, like a horrible place to spend the night.  i don't know about you, but when i think of indiana i think of trucks on cylinder blocks in every other front lawn, less teeth per capita than the national average, and while i know that they say there's "more than corn" over here, it's often very hard to believe.  like, if there is more than corn, surely what they mean by that is, "we also have wheat."  or cows or your what-have-you's.  i don't know, i'm not some backwards ass farmer, stop asking me already.  my point is that chris and i just got back a bit ago from downtown lafayette, and it's gorgeous.  it's obviously not chicago or even houston or montreal (i'm assuming), but it's pretty.  clean.  nice.  since i don't have a camera due to the unfortunate i-dropped-my-camera-into-24-ounces-of-orange-juice incident of 2003, i must resort to stealing pictures off the internet.  do forgive me.        i'm such a snob when it comes to smaller towns.  i wasn't born and raised *in* chicago- i have lived my entire life thus far in the suburbs- but i have a difficult time appreciating anything that isn't within an hour of some bustling metropolis.  i guess indianapolis is about an hour away, but, again, i can't picture that indianapolis is exactly bustling.  i do hear they have a speedway.  that's about all i've heard.  maybe tomorrow i'll fall in love with indianapolis and decide to move there in order to take up a career in teaching ballet to illiterate orphans.  it's possible.   anyhow, what i'm getting at is that i like *this* small town, and i wanted to remember it with an appropriate blog entry.  everywhere i go, i have access to a computer.  such a convenient life i lead.

       wjaf, all jackie all the time.  we played a game last night.  by we, i mean, myself, chris, cassie, and ocean.  the game was called "settlers of catan," and when chris began to explain it to us, i immediately felt sick.  games with overcomplicated strategies usually give me this feeling; i'll take a nice, rousingly simple game of "jenga" or "sorry!" any day.  but i caught on, and then last night my dreams were fused with grain and ore and wood and all of the other what-have-you's that building a settlement, and eventually a city, would require.  today we leave for four long days of game playing.  i'm in this trip for the scrabble tournament, and, also, the men.  i mean, just the scrabble tournament.  chris keeps calling this "our vacation," but i find several things wrong with this phrasing.  one, this is "his" vacation, because i had no part in planning it and am basically just going along for the ride.  and, two, the word "vacation" makes me think of strange cities and sight-seeing.  not indianapolis and walking back and forth between one hotel and the adjoining convention center.  really, this is less a vacation and more of an outing.  a trip.  there *are* differences, i swear.  nonetheless, i'm looking forward to it.  there's going to be six of us in one hotel room- do i hear pillow fight?  also, do i hear, "someone in indianopolis loves me?"  there's the money shot; aside from the scrabble, i'm in it for the t-shirt.  i should pack.  i'm waiting for chris to snap at me; i've been putting it off all morning long in favor of the computer and the tv.  also, ben folds five.  everyone should own a copy of "naked baby pictures."

       and here i am.  the interview today went good, if by good i mean bad.  badly, that would be the correct adverb.  i suppose i still have a shot, but my outlook is dim.  this interview was with the big boss man, and he wanted to see some of my portfolio pieces.  i couldn't very well tell him that i had long since destroyed my portfolio in favor of using the binder as a poem and story holder, so when i got home, i had to throw some shit together to email him.  shit, that's the operative word.  so, i'm kind of down.  i could still have a chance, but it seemed like every question he asked me, i had to answer, "no, i'm not familiar with that."  what a downer.  maybe i should get a government job.  sitting in a tollbooth all day sounds like it would be fun, right?  and lucrative.  one toll for illinois, one for jackie.  one for illinois, one for jackie.  one for.... bleh.  i need cheese.

       i went to a baseball game last night; god bless the minor leagues and their seven dollar tickets.  tom brought his son, debbie brought hers (plus saida's son as well), and heather brought her kid, too.  if there's one child in this world that will make me want to remove all of my inner tubing and replace it with pipe cleaners, it would be heather's brat cameron.  this kid is a bigger asshole at the age of nine than most established assholes are at the age of, say, 26.  34.  whatever.  he threw popcorn in my beer.  he threw chicken wings out onto the baseball field.  when the players came up to the wall, cameron unloaded an armful of stuff onto the closest one and demanded, "sign my stuff."  how had he acquired this stuff?  he'd said to debbie's husband, "buy me stuff."  there was no please, there was no thank you, and did i mention that he dropped popcorn into my beer?  there were fireworks at the end; this was my personal favorite part of the night.  that and hanging out with tom, who has perfected every imaginable wordplay there could possibly be on the word "ball."  heh heh, ball.  how i miss these people.  how good it was to see kevin, how nice it felt to complain about store 11 to my family at 280.  i got a baseball and had everyone sign it.  "miss you," wrote debbie.  "come back," wrote curtis.  they didn't get the game; they were supposed to pretend to be baseball players signing for a kid- but, hell, i'll take the sentiment.  i miss them, too.  and maybe i will come back, once a month, if i get this other job and remain a casual part timer at good old l.c.  if i'm going to work once a month, right, i might as well work with who i want to, at the store i like, even if it is an hour drive.  what's an hour?  technically, what's two hours- an hour there and an hour back.... damn, that's a lot of driving.  maybe i'll need to reconsider that.

       in the span of one half hour, bill calls me to vent about nikki and then nikki instant messages me to complain about bill.  i find that this situation tends to happen to me a lot; i get in the middle of other people's problems.  this is not because i put myself there; instead, i am put there by these friends of mine, but, being the why-don't-you-open-up-to-me-because-i'm-nosy-about-your-secrets person that i am, i never put up my hands and say, "whoa.  i'd rather not listen to this.  from either of you."  i don't necessarily think i encourage it, but i must be, because it always happens.  if it's not nikki and bill, it's roger and gina.  who are roger and gina, you may ask?  they were karate instructors i once knew, back in the day when i went out of my way to acquaint myself with.... karate instructors.  the thing is, nikki and bill are both right and both wrong.  this is often the way it goes; there is no white and black, just varying degrees of grey.  and any way you slice it is:  nikki treats bill like shit because bill lets her.  ever been in a relationship like that?  what end were you on?  my throat is killing me.  maybe cereal will help.

       what a day!!  my job interview went rather well; you never know how much you have to brag about in terms of work and educational experience until you start blathering.  the guy who was interviewing me was wearing jeans; if i get hired, do i get to wear jeans too?  please say yes.  so, i had that interview and then brent called and said a position at the college might be opening up soon.... i'm getting it from all angles, like that video i saw once of a girl getting "rogered" in six different places, including the backs of her knees.  talk about your graphic videos.  not that i rented this; it was playing on continuous loop at the museum of sex.  but i digress.  so, i have two potential job offers, PLUS, my good friend mitch is driving up tonight to hang out.  see, lebowskifest fell through for a number of reasons i would rather not list, so mitch, who is now also not going to lebowskifest, planned a spur of the moment trip to chicagoland.  good old mitch.  i just hope his car doesn't get towed tonight from our lot.  monday, my final interview.  tuesday, indianapolis.  tonight, mitch.  tomorrow, hanging out with the old southside gang, and sunday's dinner with my parents.  it's so nice to say "dinner with my parents-" because it's *only* dinner.  only pleasantries, only eating, and then i go home.  to my own home.  what a life.

        "well, jaclyn, i'd like to meet you.  how does 9:30 on friday sound?"  "don't you think that's kind of early?"   i always manage to put my foot in my mouth somehow.  overall, i think the phone interview went well.  tomorrow's the face-to-face dance.  *****  there was almost a fist fight in the store last night.  my customer called another customer a "clown," and then there was shouting back and forth, and then the two men tossed down the stuff they'd been holding and made moves towards each other like a punch was about to be thrown.  i was sitting on my stool right next to them, and i jumped out of it and scurried behind another desk, getting ready to crawl beneath it.  luckily, my manager stepped in and prevented whatever may have taken place.  trying to act like i had not been prepared to scream, i calmly strode back to my computer and continued the sale.  "clown."  who calls someone else a "clown?"  i rather like it.  *****  my favorite board game is scrabble.  i think i'm getting better at it.  one day, i hope to make a career out of it.  the key is knowing the two-letter words, the ones that no one else has ever even heard of.  the other key is being able to get up in the middle of the game and go online to look up words.  last night, i was really hoping "unpaint" was a word.  like, i've just painted this garage, but i made a mistake by choosing lime and goldenrod, so now i need to unpaint it.  hand me my unpainter.  a really good word i wish was a word is from saturday scrabble with julie and brent- blinkery.  i just got a job down at the blinkery.  i make blinkers.  one day i will not make blinkers.  then i may report to duty at the  un blinkery.  we played last night.  the players were me, chris, jordan, and cassie and ocean playing on a single team.  because there are only four racks.  chris and i came to the conclusion we could never be on the same team.  the whole thrill of the game is the competition between us.  on a team?  no competition.  just fighting over which words are real words and who came up with which ones.  it would be awful.  one of us would end up sleeping outside.  it probably wouldn't be me.  what kind of sick man makes a woman sleep outside?  poor chris would have to deal with the elements.  i just hope that if it were to rain, it would only be a mist, as to not get him *too* soaked.  ha.  ha.  ha.  *****  time to go to work.  then no work for ten days.

       i was reading my old blog last night.  i have two old blogs, both of which i keep hidden from the public.  this is for reasons that i cannot quite explain except to say that, whenever there's some emotional change in my life, i like to get rid of the evidence leading up to that emotional change.  this is why, before the blogging age, i started and stopped over a dozen journals (even more than a baker's dozen)- it was too painful to write in the same notebooks and be reminded of any unfair travesty that i had recently suffered.  i'm still reading the old blog, the first one, now, while i wait for my phone interview for this job to begin.  i love that it's a phone interview, that i can impress this dude first with my wit rather than having him see how profusely i'm sweating and that i have a pimple on my forehead.  also, that i can look at the company's website while chatting with him, as to cheat and make it seem, as i'm madly clicking away, that i am totally familiar and interested in this company.  the name of which i will not yet disclose in my blog.  i read this in my old blog and started laughing...   10.23.2002   ... leaving thousands badly bloated.  ...but that story in a moment. first we proceed with today's jackie update. she's gimping along quite badly, limping and lurching like she's 82 and not 22. she wants to cry out, as she did in the sort-of-mean streets of nyc right after bumbling across an intersection and spilling her orange juice, "this is not me!" she hopes her knee heals- without, of course, seeing a doctor. it really fucking hurts.   despite being physically injured, she did manage to make it today to volunteer work, giving "the gift of sight" to upwards of one hundred chicago public school students badly in need of eye exams, eye wear, and lots of standing around and waiting. it did make her feel kind of good, and the children were very happy to be getting eye exams and glasses; this is a marked difference from the kids who sulk in the orland square shop and whine about needing an eye exam and glasses. these kids today knew that they were lucky, and felt privileged- they deserved it. also, the attending doctors were very, very hot. both were just out of optometry school, and they were no older than 27 or so; the one touched jackie's back, and she nearly fell over from joy. that and her bum knees.   played pool with gail and a bunch of filipino-ites last evening. did think it would be a good idea to write a dialogue occurring between players of pool. what with "lining my shit up," "i did that on purpose," and "that wouldn't have fucking happened if you'd have fucking used some chalk," jackie is going on record as believing that the possibilities are endless.   well, kind of. it seemed a good idea at the time. she wanted to do the "big lebowski" of pool.   and next up, tips on how to turn one can of tuna into the rest of your life. 1 Shout Out jaclyn 5:58 PM    why did i start laughing?  because now that i've transferred stores, i'm now working with that hot doctor, the one who touched my back.  and because now i, obviously, am not remotely interested anymore.  obviously.  this is how my last blog entry begins:   beware the self-fulfilling prophecies indeed.   chris keeps asking to read my second blog, the one in which i go on and on about this great guy that i've just met (yeah, that would be chris).  but i think that may remain hidden permanently; i was writing that stuff before he knew i had a blog, and it just makes me seem overly anxious, kind of insecure, and over-all nutty.  all i do is write about how afraid i am, afraid that it will end.  this may be my favorite entry, though, from my personal ad days:   11.21.2002   this is great. i was just logged onto nerve checking responses to my profile (tee hee) when i decided to check out the ads of other girls in my area, just for competition's sake. i came across this GREAT ad; the girl's nickname was from a u2 song, her title was from an elvis costello song, and her answer to the question "what's in your room" was "a lot of relics and artifacts from ancient civilizations dating back to about the time my vacuum cleaner broke." and i thought to myself, "hell, she sounds like someone i wouldn't mind dating, heterosexuality be damned."  then i noticed that one of the items she couldn't live without was her pez dispenser, noticed that she was also a leo, and saw that, under profession, she'd put "professional origami artist-" which, as we all know, is always my fall-back.  i realized then that this girl who was so damn wonderful was me, from a profile put up sometime in march, when jason had told me about the onion's personals, which he had just posted on.  (i defy anyone to diagram that sentence.)  anyhow, i guess what i wanted to say was that i just fell in love with myself. and isn't that just the funniest thing we've all ever heard of? yes, i agree. Shout Out jaclyn 2:27 PM    i guess, no matter what happens, i'll always have myself.  i wish this dude would call already.  my palms are so moist; the keyboard's practically soaked.

        remember me?   that's what blogger asks when i log in.  of course i remember you, blogger.  i write in my blog five to six times a week.  at least.  sunday, chris and i met up with shane and leslie and two of leslie's friends for a night at the green mill.  it was the uptown poetry slam, and every time i go to a poetry slam, i inevitably end up thinking a couple of things.  like, a, what a bunch of wankers.  and, b, if these wankers are getting applause, then i should go up there because surely i, who am not a wanker, would recieve so much applause that farmers in iowa would be turning to each other quizzically and saying, "jeb, did you hear that?  some sort of thunderous applause-like sound/vibration just knocked over the cow."  then the two farmers would have to go and pick the cow up, placing it squarely on it's four legs.  ever try to upright a cow?  it ain't easy.  i always say that when i go to the green mill.  i always say a lot of things.  that's me- boastful mcgee who always remains seated.  sunday, when chris came home from work and saw me with my short, straight hair, we had the following conversation.  chris:  i think i'll have sausage for dinner.... (sheepishly)  do *you* like sausage? me:  no, dammit, you know i hate sausage. chris:  oh.  you're just like my last girlfriend.  maybe you had to be there.  his delivery was great.  it. was. hysterical.  i have an interview scheduled in the near future for, get this, a job.  it's quite exciting.  see, i say i want a new job, and, next thing you know, i've got someone calling me saying, "we've found your resume on monster...."  too bad there are quite a few factual errors in that resume.  it's like, i want to tell prospective employers that i'm detail oriented, but how can i when i have to say, "by the way, i made a few mistakes on my resume."  like i got the location of my current job wrong.  for a while, i had my year of graduation wrong.  my year of graduation, for crying out loud.  i was trying to find a job in 2002 with a resume that proclaimed i wouldn't be out of college until 2003.  what a dipshit, eh?  oh well.  now i'm going to my current job.  the one that i got the location of wrong.  i hope i can get there and back alright- please, say a little prayer.

       i'm watching the "three's company" movie on vh1.  who would have known that suzanne somers was such a brat?!?  no wonder they had to replace her, like, nine times.  remember when lucille ball did the "best of 'three's company'" episode?  now there's a star- lucille ball.  i'll bet she never postponed the start of her network season without letting jack and janet... ricky and ethel.... whoever... know.... lucille ball and i share the same birthday.  of course, the year is different.  you know what i liked about "pirates of the caribbean?"  johnny depp.  the rest of the movie, too, but that johnny depp... you can tell he'd be fun to hang out with.  especially if he wore that eyeliner all the time.  i got a haircut today.  i can't tell for sure right now because of the way she styled it, but it's quite possibly uneven.  the girl who did my hair looked like she was 15.  on top of that, she kept calling me sweetie.  like, i am clearly about seven years her elder, and she's calling *me* sweetie?  anyhow, i don't know what to do.  i'm not the type to go back and complain, so maybe i'll just walk around for the next few months with my head cocked to the right.  i love getting hair cuts because they blow dry my hair straight afterwards.  i have obnoxiously curly hair, so the straight look is somewhat novel and very welcome.  i hate getting my hair cut because they put that stupid cape on you.  i know it's so they won't get hair on your shirt, but it makes me feel like i'm all dressed up for halloween- as a volcano with a head sticking out of it.  creepy.  and who knows who else has been wearing that thing?  i suppose *that* doesn't matter so much- it's not like i'm eating dinner off of it.  i can just use my shirt for that, especially since it's so hair-free.  i think the girl knows the cut's uneven- as she was blowdrying it, she stepped back, squinted, and then cut more off...  this happened three times.  then i got home and had to experiment with the head-cocking look in front of the mirror.  i also had to ask myself- at what point, should i be paying more for a hair cut than i do for jeans?  because that point's been crossed- and i feel like such a tool.  a tool without jeans.  and a lopsided head.

       i called in sick to work yesterday.  i really was sick, but not sick enough to require a day off.  today, however, i'm sick enough to need to stay at home-  but, because i called in yesterday, i'm dragging myself there today.  i'd much prefer to stick my head into a bucket of worms.  so i'm looking for a new job.  the thing is, i don't know what i want to do.  i'm a certified optician, and i have a bachelor's degree in marketing.   i don't want to be an optician anymore, and i despise the field of marketing.  so what does that leave me with?  the bucket of worms.  exotic dancers can make about $500 a night.  i'd be the worst exotic dancer alive.  especially if it were topless dancing.  there'd be men demanding their cover back.  and that i get my cover back as well.  ba-dum-ching.  i hold the record for smallest chest worldwide.  i have trophies and everything.  it's kind of neat.  i don't think the exotic dancing place gives health insurance.  so that's out.  i hate working.  i don't want to do it.  i want to win the lotto or marry into money.  i want to find out that my rich uncle cornelius, who i didn't know i had, has passed away peacefully in his sleep, leaving me, his only heir above the age of 21 and below the age of 24, with his entire fortune.  his entire massive fortune.  i want my rich uncle cornelius to leave me a jeweled staff.  and a lot of electronics.  sigh.  i have to get ready for work now.

       i threw everything out.  ever regret doing that?  i throw eveyrthing out all the time.  then, when i was moving, i threw the rest of everything out.  and then my mom put the rest in boxes, so she could have my room to put HER boxes in.  and now i'm forgetting everything.  kind of.   i started writing a story last summer, a story that would be my novel if i ever got around to finishing it and writing it correctly.  and now i'm restarting it.  i'm at such a different place in my life, and i think that's a good thing.  plus, i've got it.  got what?  got it.  i rule.  kind of.  i just wish i had my stuff.  i liked my stuff.

       i'm glad i don't have to build a nest.  the birds who live in the "rafters" of our terrace have built themselves what appears to be a three bedroom, two-bath famiy home/nest, and the most amazing thing about this construction is that it's entirely twig and mud.  i mean, i'm sure there's your random twizzlers wrapper or what have you, but this set-up is mostly forest bits, and, when you consider that these powerhouse little birdies are using their beaks and not their hands (which i'm told they don't have), this end result is ultra-impressive.  when i was in fourth grade, for a project, i attempted to make my own nest.  it sucked.  i had to get my dad to finish it for me, and even his nest rather blew, despite his usage of adhesives.  so what i'm saying is that i'm thrilled to pieces that my survival in this cold, harsh world is not dependent on having to create a nest.  also, i'm happy to say that i don't have to live in one, either.  i shudder to think of the plumbing problems.

       i may complain about my mother's emails, but i love them.  tonight's opened up with, "i saw sheryl crowe at the taste.  i thought she was taller.  oh well."  easily disappointed, that woman.  i need to have my parents over sometime before we leave for vacation.  this will require massive amounts of cleaning.  the whole apartment is starting to look like my bedroom at home did, which is to say that my shoes are everywhere and any drawer or cabinet that i open- well, that usually will remain open until a couple of hours have passed and i look around, confused, and have to ask myself, "who the hell left all the cabinets open?"  also, i tend to notice that i leave a trail, be it napkins, books, the aforementioned shoes, whatever.  but, hey.  pobody's nerfect.  my favorite email from mom said, "hope everything went okay with the more."  two paragraphs later, she writes, "the word more should have been moved."  she's new to this whole computing thing; the delete key and/or backspacing key remains a mystery.

       last evening, my good friend shane and i saw "28 days later," which gave me quite the descriptive, horrifying, and oddly scientific nightmare.   we walked into the theater not knowing anything about the movie; i was kind of fearful that it was possibly a sequel to sandra bullock's "28 days," which also would have resulted in a horrifying nightmare.  thankfully, these fears were unfounded, as sandra bullock didn't make even the slightest cameo appearance.  i don't recommend many movies, but i do recommend this one, because it's scary and gross and filmed in london.  so go see it and let me know what you think of it.  shane just got back from sweden, and he's got a baker's dozen worth of developed film rolls.  he's the kind of guy who takes a picture of everything.  for example, there's a picture of a folding chair that he really liked.  there was also a picture of a trash can that he thought was kind of neat.  whenever i hang out with him, i feel motivated to grab my own camera and attempted to capture all of the beauty in the world, or at least in the chicagoland area.  however, there are several problems with this.  one, i don't have a camera anymore as i dropped mine into a vat of orange juice, and, two, once i get my film back from the drug store, all the "beauty" that i've captured ends up being slightly marred by the fact that i have no concept of good photography.  composition.  technique.  shutter speed.  whether of not it's a good idea to have your thumb in the way of the lens.  all still a mystery.  that brings me back to sweden.  i think i'd like to go there, but i can't necessarily give you a good reason why.  oh, i've got a good reason:  how cool would a "someone in stockholm loves me" t-shirt be?  pretty cool.  so there's your reason.

       don't you hate pants?  i spent friday afternoon with my best friend carole, who flew in this weekend from new york city, which is a place where they sell roasted, sugary peanuts right there on the street.  there is a secret life that i have when i am with carole, and while i understand that may sound like i'm trying to tell you i'm a lesbian, what i mean is that a different side of me is always brought out when i'm in her company.  this is a side that most people don't see, and since it is secret, i'm going to leave it at that and not bother to explain.  friday evening, christopher and i watched the fireworks from the race track.  i like fireworks, and you know i'm really missing these days?  sparklers.  also those things you throw on the sidewalk that snap.  another association with fourth of july that i miss?  water balloons.  but back to the fireworks; they were big and pretty.    after the fireworks, or just before they were about to end since we wanted to beat traffic, we headed into the city where it would no longer be just us, as we were meeting up with carole and some of her silly little friends- the ones that i can't talk to about anything except "elimidate" or the guess? store at the mall.  this is the part in the story where things go sour.  i drank and drank, and while i was fine at the bar, the second i got home was bad news, bears.  i can count the number of times i've thrown up due to alcohol on one hand, without using all of my fingers, and, unfortunately, friday night was one of those times.  in between spews, i remember crying, "i'm so bad!  i'm SOO bad!!" and "i'm so fucked!  i'm SOO fucked!!"  then i passed out, woke up, and went to work.  i handled myself surprisingly well considering that i felt so sick i could barely stand.  then last night was eric & emily's fifth of july party, which had a fiesta theme.  pretty refreshing after all of that american patriotism crap.  although i was not completely recovered from what the spanish refer to as a "hangover" (the spanish who speak english), i had a blast.  and i left there feeling really happy.  here i am with a boyfriend whose friends- whose extremely funny and smart friends-  i totally like and get along with.  i believe they, as well, totally like and get along with me.  that gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling, like the kind of feeling induced by care bears, especially because i am, as the spanish say, without a group of close, tight-knit friends like that.   so if i can continue to infiltrate my way into this group of friends, all will be good.  and now it's sunday.  elvis costello is playing at the taste today, and while i know my sweet little sister probably wants to go, i am without motivation to drive into the city and attempt to find parking.   so instead i will just remind myself, repeatedly, how absolutely horrible his concert was in october.  how absolutely horrible.  horrible.  absolutely.

       the best thing about the fourth of july is the fifth of july, when you get to read about all of the horrible firework accidents from the night before.  the second best thing about the fourth of july is that it's not the fourth of january.  because the fourth of january is usually much colder.  the third best thing about the fourth of july is that i finally get a chance to wear my red, white, and blue tank top and matching red, white, and blue capris.  along with my red, white, and blue sun hat and star-spangled flip-flops.  no, wait, that's not me.  that's some annoying asshole in front of me at the gas station.  who i will hopefully read about the next day, the fifth, in the chicago tribune's yearly special issue "how all you stupid fucks messed up and are now without eyebrows.  and the family dog."

       yeah, i hate my job.  oh god, how horrible it is.  i think i've been spoiled for too long- now i'm paying for it.  my job used to be 80% fooling around, and now... well, i don't know the exact percentage, but it's something like, oh, ZERO?  no fun, at all.  i'm miserable!!   it's like having a real job, only, well, i still don't consider it a real job.  like, i make enough money for it to be a real job, but since i'm a college graduate, i feel that a real job entails business cards and a desk.  i have neither, unless i white-out my manager's name on *his* business cards  and write in my own.  and then start putting my stuff on his desk.  but there are several problems with this scenario, all of which i will outline below.   Real Job "Requirements" and Why I Can't Fake Them  I.  Business Cards and Whiting-Out My Manager's Name and Writing In My Own     A.  People can always tell these things.    B.  I'd have to buy white-out.    C.  Customers might, having been duped into believing that I'm in charge, start complaing to *me* instead of him.    D.  How embarrassing would it be if I got *caught*?    E.  I'm physically incapable of writing that small, as small as an 8 point computer font.  Physically.  Incapable.    F.  That's a lot of fucking business cards to go through.  II.  Putting My Stuff on My Boss' Desk     A.  I don't have any stuff.    B.  What would I do with *his* stuff?  Burn them?  Where would I start the fire?  And how would I safely extinguish it?    C.  After I found some shit to put on his desk, I'd feel obligated to sit there.  Once I sat there, I'd have no idea what to do, and I'd probably fall asleep.  This would greatly endanger my chances of getting home on time.    D.  I'd probably use his desk as a place to apply white-out to my new business cards.  This would result in white-out spills.  Which I'd have to clean.   as you can clearly see, this would never work.  but i don't care about a desk and business cards.  what i care about is enjoying my time, and, at this store, i'm simply not enjoying my time.  what's a girl to do?  i guess not every aspect of my life can be perfect.   i should just deal with this, or maybe find another job, and revel in the fact that i love who i come home to after the day's worth of work is done.  i should.  i'll probably, however, just keep complaining about how much i hate my job.

       i'm on hour five of visiting my parents, and let me tell you this:  i came here wayyy too early today.  in a little while, i'm going to carole's to check out baby jack.  i can't wait to see his balls.  there are labels all over my parents' comptuer warning about computer viruses.  "never open email attachments."  "be aware of all email subjects!"  "maybe you should just use the phone instead?"  it's insane.  this entire house has operating instructions on every square inch.  there's a note on the refrigerator saying "make sure you close refrigerator door!"  one has to wonder how *that* one came about.  someone got up for a midnight snack, forgot to shut the freezer, and the next morning my mother found a squirrel inside setting up house?  i don't know.  i can't ask.  i wish chris were here.  but he had to work.  how convenient.  how very, very convenient.  my sister found a box of my stuff and proceeded to read everything that was in the box- letters, cards, JOURNALS- and what she said was, "you have a lot of explaining to do."  heh.  heh.  heh.  anyhow, last night with carole, and chris, was great.  the only weird thing- and carole agrees- is that when we see each other after not having hung out in months, the first few hours are full of... bullshit.  all the mundane pleasantries, all the semi-awkward questions and answers- basically, a total lack of superstardom.  but then there are those moments, after the lacking, that are just perfect.  perfect and too intangible to explain.  my grandma gave me a vacuum cleaner.  it looks like it's circa 1962.  i'll just be happy if it works.  we haven't vacuumed the apartment at all.  in nearly 3 months.  under a microscope, it's probably a thriving city-  a thriving city that had better be bracing for inevitable destruction via lots of sucking.  and some blowing.  this 1962 monster is going to tear some shit up.

       carole's home this weekend from the big apple, and so tonight is our night to hit the town, maybe knock over a liquor store, and then proceed to drink everything that we've stolen.  for some reason today, i'm thinking of the vagina monologues, which we went to see about a year ago.  it starred marcia brady, which was kind of odd.  imagine marcia brady faking an orgasm.  it was enough to make me stop watching nick at night; i guess i should be thankful that it wasn't alice up there.  it's one thing to imagine marcia having sex, or masturbating, but another thing to think of alice.  even sam the butcher's presence made me question alice's sexuality.  i don't think alice was a lesbian, like vh1's "i love the seventies" seemed to suggest- but alice was definitely asexual.  as in, she could reproduce herself without any help- create, on her own, an entire army of alices that would later destroy most of who-ville, or whereever it was they lived.  anyhow, we went to the vagina monologues, and surely we looked like we were out on a date, my carole and me.  that was one thing we laughed about; another was in the end when i saw my name posted above the door.  i had won a prize.  i had won a vibrator.  "have fun," said the leering asian kid who handed me my new toy, which was encased in a velvet, heart-shaped box.  "heh heh heh."  i had to walk to the car holding a vibrator wrapped in velvet.  we thought everybody we passed just KNEW what i was holding.  and, oh, how greatly hysterical the whole night was.  batteries were included, but i had trouble using it right away because of marcia brady.  some events just shouldn't occur in nature.  ever.

       only my sister can write an entire email about bowel movements.  today she also wrote:  "did you know i'm learning a new language?  it's the language of math!"  gee.  how exciting.  i wonder how it's going w/ the conjugating.  i just got done reading "bird by bird: instructions on writing and life."  this is because i'm still working on becoming a famous writer.  what better way to learn to write than by reading about it?  i mean, besides actually writing.  the only problem is that i once tried reading a novel by this author and then had to stop because my eyes were starting to blur from the boredom.  so who, exactly, am i taking writing advice from?  would i be better off reading a book called "how to write" by, say, peter from "the family guy?"  my problem is that for over a year i've been grappling with the same storyline.  and it's not a funny story.  and, basically, i'm the main character.  this may sound a bit egotistic, but they say "write about what you know," and i'm what i know.  but among other things that i know is that i'm better with humor than with seriousness.  and nothing is coming together, at all.  the other characters keep changing, the ones other than me.  i want to write about my best friends, old and new, and what they taught me.  i want to write about my mother.  i want to write about being selfish and afraid and then about being surprised.  i want to write about being brainwashed by someone who is completely *wrong*, and then being haunted by them- i want to write about brainwashing myself....  about fooling myself.  i want to write about delusions of flying, about knowing who i am and then not wanting to talk about it, and about the fucked up ways we sometimes choose to express ourselves.  i want to write about an anorexic and an artist and an academic and an abuser and about how it really is nurture, not nature, and then i want to write about why we look at strangers.  but who's going to want to read that?  i have so many false starts, because, above all, i want to be funny.  and some things just aren't that funny.  i'm writing a little story about a man who's writing inspirational calendars.  only he's a real prick.  and i started writing from an idea i got from chris, a man who has superpowers linked to an appliance.  but that reminds me too much of my story from last year about the talking blender.  and you know how i've pegged this man with the superpowers?  he's got the same voice as my man from the story where a talking bear is delivered to his doorstop.  which is the same voice of the prick who's writing the calendars.  you see what i'm getting at?  it's all the same.  talking crap, a prick, an appliance or two.  but at least that stuff makes me smile.  and shake my head.  sigh.  i'm going to write my sister an email about my *own* bowel movements.  now that should be something interesting.

       ocean is full of good ideas, like this one:      it's macaroni and cheese (and peas) in a bread bowl.  some may consider this a huge waste of bread.  still others may not see the point, since he's also using a plate.  i, however, find it to be quite a delightful idea.  one of those "had to be there moments:" when he gave me some macaroni and cheese (and peas) in a regular bowl and then said "here," proceeding to plop in a huge hunk of the bread that he had scooped from his own bowl.  it was like the antithesis of the bread bowl- this large, misshapen piece of bread sitting in the center of my cheesy, and pea-escorted, noodles.  i won't lie; i didn't eat all that bread.  but ocean didn't eat all of his bowl either- hey, at least we got the photo.   !@#$%^&*()_+

       i'm quite certain i'm the only "ferclyn" on the web.  that's *world wide* web, which leads me to believe that i'm the only ferclyn in the *world.*  there's something comforting about believing this.  i'm not the only me in the world.  doing some ego surfing one year, i found another me in boston.  she's about a year older than me, a law student, and very hot.  she's the only other person who could have rights to the "ferclyn" claim.  i highly doubt she's thought of it, though- but, if she has, and if she really is a law student, then i may one day run into some copyright problems.  i wonder if me and the other me are cousins or something... the last name's not that common, after all... or i wonder if that's actually ME out there, the result of some odd cloning project.  now that would be interesting.  i wonder how i'm liking boston.

       usually, when i'm dreaming, there's always a part of me that knows i'm dreaming.  lately, i'm dreaming, and i no longer know whether or not what's going on is reality or just my sleeping subconscious.  this makes every night rather terrifying, especially because my mind never lets anything good happen to me whilst in dreamland.  i wake up having to give myself a pep talk, and my pep talks are usually along the lines of, "alright, you're okay, nothing like that has occurred in your life... yet."  i would have made a very poor cheerleader.  "go team!  although don't waste too much energy, because you're probably not going to win anyhow!! whoo!"  insert leg kicks.  optimism is an acquired outlook on life.  it's like bleu cheese-  you have to practice.  although i never had to practice with bleu cheese; i liked it the first time i tried it.  so maybe optimism is more like horse radish.  that would really be a damn shame because i have vowed to never try horse radish again, after the horse radish incident of '89.  i thought that it was cheese, and so i slathered a whole bunch of it onto a cracker and proceeded to pop the cracker into my mouth.  imagine my surprise when i found out it was not cheese on my cracker, but horse radish- or, as it is also known as, pureed shit.  i drank four glasses of water afterwards, but the taste remained for approximately twelve years.  anyhow, i started this post with the intentions to share my nightmare.  now it seems that i've changed my mind.

       carole has a new nephew.  his name is jack, and he was just born yesterday.  she sent me a picture that i was unable to download, but apparently this infant's got balls the size of his head.  he's going to grow up to be something else, that jack.  i'd kind of like to think that carole's sister named her kid "jack" after me.  i, however, don't have balls the size of my head.  so she probably, in fact, named him after somebody else.

       sometimes you wake up, get upset about something, do something in defense, and then think, "why did i even bother?"  but a lot of actions don't have delete buttons, and so you have to do what you do best and just walk away from the open can of worms.  oh the adjectives i could ascribe to the worms.  what a day.  and, oh, what a night.

       thoughts running through my head at work  don't touch that.  i heard you the first time.  you obviously didn't hear me the first time, because this is the third time you're asking the same fucking question.  you're not allowed to bargain.  don't touch that.  damn, you need a breath mint.  your wife needs a breath mint, too.  this wouldn't have happened if you weren't so cheap.  i don't care what your insurance card says, we don't take it.  what a fucking cheapskate.  i'm sorry, m'am, but no matter what pair of glasses you buy, you're still going to be fat.  really fat.  don't touch that.  put things back where you got them from.  could you please wipe the cheeto powder off of your kids hands before he touches anything else?  don't put that frame in your mouth; that's disgusting for several reasons.  yeah, sure you only clean your lenses with our cleaning stuff.  yeah, does it *look* repairable?  that's a coupon for *pearle,* you jackass.  why do you look so surprised at the price?  don't touch that.  are you even listening to me?  i wish you had washed your face this morning; you're getting oil on all the frames.  can't you see how busy i am?  don't get pissy with me; i could fuck your vision up so badly, so subtly, that it would drive you NUTS and yet you'd never know, exactly, what was wrong.  come on, buy another pair, you can obviously afford it.  our policy does not cover stupidity.  have you been *chewing* on these?  don't touch that.  no, i don't have any samples.  just take my word for it.  god, i hope i never end up like you.  i don't care where your nose hurts.  it's not the frames, it's your thin, wrinkled, veiny face that's causing all that pain.  um, yeah, those look real good.  i swear to god, lady, if you don't stop asking me the same question nine times, i'm going to bore a hole through your skull with this screwdriver.  no.  i can't give you anything for free.  what does this look like?  we close in five minutes.  don't you have a home?

       last night i got bit on the ass by a five year old.  he was hiding in my toilet.  now, i usually check for things in the toilet, such as five year olds or sewer monsters or my toothbrush or somebody else's poop, but last night i was in too big of a hurry.  i was given quite the surprise when i sat down.  "yee-oww!"  i yelped, leaping up and cracking my skull on the towel bar.  "who are you!?!?"  i think he was lithuanian.  i couldn't get a word of english out of him.  grinning at me from the toilet, i could see that his little teeth were sharpened to points.  i rubbed at my ass and wondered if i was in any real medical danger.  "i don't speak lithuanian," i said loudly, hoping he would understand, "so if you can just get out and go home, that would be really swell."  he snapped his teeth at me.  flustered, and still having to pee since my first attempt had been foiled, i thought about it for a moment and hit the flusher.  i had to hit it a few more times because he kept getting stuck, but eventually he was gone, down the pooper and flushed out of my life like many a cigarette butt, like many a dead goldfish, like many a... well, i'm too much of a lady to go on.

       karaoke rule number 14:  don't dedicate a karaoke song to *anyone*.  especially a recently deceased grandmother.  karaoke rule number 57:  it's not cool to steal the little golf pencils that come inside the karaoke book.  karaoke rule number 242:  never, ever become a regular.  then all the other regulars will know that you don't have a healthy social life.  that, outside of the karaoke bar, you can't even get the homeless to talk to you.  karaoke rule number 483:  if you think you know the words, you don't.  read the goddamn screen.  just a few more...  it's an early night.  chris and i both work early in the morning on, of all days, saturday.  also sunday, which i hear is referred to as the "sabbath" in certain circles.  tonight, we had a dinner consisting of salad (the bag of which i opened myself), stuffed mushrooms (which chris made himself, so very deserving of the word 'orgasmic'), and crabs.  don't buy crabs.  the meat was good, but there was so little of it!  not to mention that, while eating it, we emptied a  tub of butter.  by the way, if you're reading this, ocean, we owe you a tub of butter.  so, i've been on and off.  i think that, for the rest of my life, i will always have episodes that leave me feeling lower than low.  i think some people call it "depression," but those people charge way too much, and so i will refer to it as "a case of the mondays."  on tuesdays.  and wednesdays.  and thursdays and fridays.  you get the picture.  no matter how well things may be going for me, i'll get hit with these feelings for no apparent reason.  and i can't explain them, what they are or where they come from.  it's been a weird couple of weeks for me, which the average blog reader probably doesn't know, but i think i'm feeling better.  i'm hoping, at least.  then i figure i'm good for another six months, which leaves me at about mid-february when i'm throwing food across the kitchen and sobbing because i can't stand being in the same room with myself.  which is mostly unavoidable.  but by mid-march, i'll be okay again.  and that's what we live for.  the worst part is that i feel bad... for chris.  like i should have warned him better that, every once in a while, i would be like this.  not the joke-cracking wiseass he fell in love with, but the hopeless, mopey, whiney, needy, sniffling, drained-of-energy... wiseass... that... he fell in love with.  unwittingly.  he should've known there was a catch.  ha. ha. ha.  and, hey, i'm writing this now, of all times, when i actually feel better.  so typical.  i always wait until the last possible minute to get things off my chest.   what's bothering you?  nothing.

       karaoke rule number 621:  don't do "lightning crashes," by live.  you don't want to have to say the word "placenta" in a bar.  bill and i went to one of the local bars last night. neither of us sang, but there was one dope doing the aforementioned "lightning crashes."  and i thought, why?  why?  it's not a karaoke song.  "sweet caroline" is a karaoke song.  "build me up buttercup."  now *that's* a karaoke song.  you can go on the karaoke circuit and win tons of shit.  also, "golden tee," the golfing arcade game.  i think the grand prize is something like seventy grand.  and, magic, the card game, does tournaments where the winner pulls in over a quarter of a million.  that's  dollars , not... like, tacos, or something.  it really makes you think.    to be successful in this world, you don't need college.  you just need a shitty hobby of some sort.  plus free time.  then you shake well and serve.

       it's really about the loss of innocence.  the symbolism is not particulary easy to pick up on, but a careful reader will notice that the plastic pancakes show up whenever there's about to be a metamorphosis of some sort.  the green syrup stands for resistance.  the year-old butter is the habits that we are afraid to lose.  notice that the main characters all have names beginning with numbers.  this is no coincidence.  i modeled 5cynthia after my mother, a tall, long-haired woman who often drew her eyebrows on with strange shades of red and burgundy.  the preface was written by a man i befriended on the subway.  the preface to the preface was written by the nya- national yogurt association.  and the cover was illustrated by norman rockwell.  i got it off a calendar.

       i played sim city 4 last night before going to bed.  my nightmares, therefore, were fraught with worries over where to build my roads, whether or not to put residential zoning next to industrial, and if i could get by with having only one small police station.  this may be why i don't get into computer games.  because they haunt me.  i was tossing and turning all night long.  this reminds me of the tetris debacle back in '92.  i played during the day and then had dreams at night that my uncle (why my uncle, i still don't know) was standing on a ladder throwing tetris pieces at me.  "make a line, bitch!"  he'd cry, and i'd try my best but usually end up having one of the more sharp, angular pieces cracking me right on the forehead.  for weeks whenever i closed my eyes, i'd see tetris pieces, and my uncle, and i'd go mad trying to mentally arrange them- and avoid getting hit by them.  eventually, i had to stop playing.  then i got "zombies ate my neighbors" for super nintendo, and even my waking hours were spent figuring out whether i should run from the undead or be brave and try to kill them.  by "undead," i mean "family members."  like my uncle, r.i.p.  i also watched "high fidelity" yesterday, for about the twelfth time.  lord, what a great movie.  the part where tim robbins get his teeth knocked out by a slam to the jaw from a telephone makes me laugh so hard i have to pee.  just thinking about it, i kind of have to pee.  excuse me for a moment.

       saturday was fun.  sunday, recovering from saturday, was not fun.  just so we're all caught up, today is monday.   (details and... oh, how embarrassing.)  yesterday i watched a foreign film.  i noticed that the actors seemed to be saying a lot more than what was translated.  i think i'd probably do that, too, if i were a translator.  character:  after the train wreck that killed my uncle, i was very sad.  i went for the reading of the will on a rainy monday, and i was very surprised to find out he had left me sole custody of his rabbits.  translated as:  i need a shotgun to get rid of some rabbits.

       i don't understand.  today's word of the day is still "davy jones' locker."  i'm doing fine, thanks for asking.  i'm staring at my cell phone bill.  i've got a great plan.  all the minutes you could possibly need for 29 bucks.  a girl can't go wrong.  this month?  it's 70 bucks.  i do this all the time, which makes no sense because i hate talking on the phone for more than two minutes.  no conversation should go over 2 minutes.  "hi, it's me."  "hey."  "wanna do something?"  "sure.  nine?"  "yeah, nine."  (pause)  "how's the diarrhea?"  "oh, it's better."  "and the chronic vomiting?"  "i think it was the taco bell."  "alright, see you at nine."  see, i even got some banter in there, and it still comes out to under two minutes.  who the hell am i talking to for so long?  it must be that radio show i keep calling into.  "and, you're on the air!"  "okay.... hello, can you hear me?"  "you're on the air!"  "yeah, hi, jackie from her living room, first time listener long time caller.  i just had a question for your producer."  "go right ahead, little lady!"  "why's he such a fucking douche bag?"  "what-"  "your morning dj's are morons.  and the one dude keeps referring to his wife, but it's clear to everyone that he's a raging homosexual.  he's got his cock so far up-"  "either request a song or i'll disconnect you."  "- the other guy's asshole that-"  click.  "and you're on the air!"  "yeah, jackie again.  i was somehow disconnected a few moments ago.  can i request a song?"  anyhow, somebody's going to have to pay this bill, and it's not going to be.  so maybe i'll just... get out my checkbook... write the check... put it in an envelope... hmm, that's not going to work.  tonight we're celebrating my belated birthday downtown in the city of lights with some of my fabulous ex-coworkers.  that store was really amazing.  there were tons of us between the ages of 21 and 26, and we were all so fucking cool.  i mean, most of us were so fucking cool.  i certainly was.  anyhow, i got to go.

       in the fourth grade, i copied my math tests from the indian girl next to me named sangita.  she always got a's, and so i always got a's.  fourth grade math was crucial because how well you did seemed to determine what classes you would take for the next decade or so.  i spent most of grade school copying math.  in junior high, i also copied.  in high school, i did exceedingly well in advanced algebra.... but everything else involved either copying or making cheatsheets.  finally, in my senior year, i was put in calculus.  lord knows why i agreed to this.  most of calculus was spent sleeping or doodling.  this year, i knew i was too lost to even copy, and so i failed it.  it was the only F i ever got.  i'm horrible at math.  it struck me yesterday exactly how inept i am.  i mean, i know i don't know the first thing about finding the circumference of a circle- something about pi multiplied by how long your pencil is?- but i thought that at least i could always add.  who can't add?  it's the first thing you learn, after basic shapes.  well, i know my basic shapes- but on three separate incidents yesterday, i added the price of the frame plus the price of the lenses- and ended up quoting a number that was nowhere near the actual total.  and this made me both feel and look really, really dumb.  i wanted to say to my customers, "i'm not as stupid as i sound.  it's just that i was never good at math... or science... or remembering important dates in history... or any subject that involved a lot of attention to detail.... really, i was going to major in english, but then i didn't feel like doing any reading."  so i majored in marketing.  not the marketing/business aspect that would have involved numbers and analyzing them, but the marketing/communications aspect that involved discussing what color would best sell bran.  i can't add.

       sometimes i feel utterly incapable of holding a conversation.  sometimes i feel like speech is such a chore and that i would much rather keep myself locked up somewhere with the internet and maybe a flashlight as my only means of communication with the outside world.  sometimes i feel like the things i say don't make any sense.  or that i'm talking through a mouthful of graham crackers and all that's coming out is crumbs.  when i type in my blog, sometimes i hear the 'doogie howser, md' theme music.  then since i always get neil patrick harris confused with that kid ricky from 'silver spoons,' after a few moments, i start to hear the 'silver spoons' theme.  i'm a bad public speaker.  i talk fast and refuse to look at anyone.  i mutter little asides to myself such as, "well, this isn't going anywhere," and "not like this guy cares" which tend to detract from my point.  if i'm talking to more than two people and notice that more than two people happen to be looking at me, i lose it completely.  i no longer know what to do with my hands, so i wave them around.  i accentuate the wrong syllables.  when i can't think of what word to say, i substitute with, "you know what i'm talking about."  we all, however, know that they don't.  when i think something is really funny, i have a laugh that basically sounds like something inside my throat has exploded.  it's exploded and it's coming to kill you.  i never liked 'doogie howser, md.'  i never thought he was cute.  i only watched the shows because i too wanted a computerized journal.  when i was a kid, i wasn't allowed to use our word processing program except for homework.  see, my parents stifled the writer in me for fear that i'd accidentally erase their hard drive.  and now look.  an ugly internet worm has gotten to their system- and it wasn't because i wanted to write a story about how fifth graders rule and fourth graders drool.  once i did accidentally erase the hard drive- or at least a key part of it.  but that, you see, is not my point at all.

       all the computers in this apartment crashed and/or became infected with that stupid worm.  they say those that started the virus had a sense of humor because they encoded some snotty remarks about bill gates in the virus.  sense of humor?  i was not laughing.  why couldn't they have encoded the snotty remarks in, say, a newsletter?  a greeting card?  a personal ad in the washington post?  why in a virus that's infected *my* computer?  don't they understand that things that irritate me are never, ever funny?  luckily, all is well, which is good because i've only paid off 1/10 of this laptop.  basically, i own the home row and the part of the memory that the paint program inhabits.

       we went to a wedding last night.  the dinner alone, i understand, cost literally an arm and a leg for each plate.  close to two arms, one leg, and part of the spinal cord.  that's not counting the renting of the fancy shmancy ballroom at the hotel inter-continental on michigan avenue, the umpteen photographers, the what appeared to be six thousand arrangements of roses each the size of your average canadian province, and then the spotlight for each of these enormous rose arrangements.   my mind whirled thinking of the expenses-  the princess-like wedding dress, the live band with four separate violinists, the mushroom bar, the filet mignon, the fact that we were in a ballroom- a  ballroom .  with servers who folded your napkins for you if you got up for even a second.  we had macaroni and cheese served in martini glasses.  maki rolls as an appetizer.  there were about a dozen people in the live band, and there were elevator attendants and godiva chocolates and a view of michigan avenue.  it all got me to thinking.  when i get married, i'll never be able to afford anything like this.  when i get married, the reception will probably be in the motel six convention room.  on a wednesday.  after thinking about all the money lauren's parents shelled out for this gala, i feel kind of bad for only getting them a thirty dollar clock at "things remembered."  but some of us can afford ballrooms, and the rest of us can afford clocks.  thirty dollar ones.  there were speeches, of course.  lauren and eric are perfect for each other, perfect, a perfect match, she's the perfect girl, he's the perfect guy, they're the perfect couple, the wedding is perfect, their love is perfect, everything's just perfect, perfect.  thank you for sharing this wonderful day, this wonderful couple, what a wonderful wedding, a wonderful love, he's just so wonderful, she's just so wonderful, their love is so wonderful, everything's just wonderful.  perfectly wonderful.  a thesaurus would been a better gift, methinks, rather than the clock.    ah, i think i'm bitter.  i don't want to be bitter, or envious, or cynical.... but i also don't want to be wasting one of my few days off by watching tv and playing on the computer all afternoon....  and look at that, i am.  so, while you  can  help most things, you usually don't.  or at least  i  don't.  insert smile.

       i turned down a chance to go to seattle.  nikki's going in september to visit her friend javier (apparently you pronounce the "j" like an "h"), and she requested that i come along.  she got a deal- three hundred bucks for a round trip plane ticket and hotel.  i love seattle.  even the fact that it's always so dreary kind of turns me on.  there's something about seattle that's just cool.  like, if seattle were a guy, it would be a tall, attractive guy wearing the greatest three dollar thirft store shirt you've ever seen.  it would be a guy with a dry, cynical sense of humor who drinks a lot of coffee and stomps through the city in enviable boots.  he paints and writes and reads great books by little-known, recently published authors and listens to cutting edge albums *and* wants to see every new indie film that you do.  he's smart.  he never shows off about it, but you know he's smart, because it shows in his jokes.  he has very nice eyes and doesn't flinch if it starts to rain.  if seattle were a guy, that's what the guy would be like.  and if seattle were a girl, i'd like to think that girl would kind of be like me, only closer to the version of me that makes my aspirations more of a reality.  so, if seattle were a girl, it would be a tall, thin girl wearing the greatest three dollar thrift store shirt you've ever seen.  greatest sense of humor you've ever come across, coupled with a dollops of modesty.  she'd also be attractive, but not in your stereotypical way.  like, her boyfriend would refer to her as "unbearably cute," but most people wouldn't really notice her until they got her talking.  she'd read and write and take great photographs with a camera that actually worked; she'd have a good record collection and a working knowledge of most things artistic or, at least, interesting.  she'd be sarcastic, have a slight mean streak, and yet still be nice to animals and foreigners and usually children, unless of course they were sticky fingered or too demanding.  i mean both the children and the foriegners.   she'd also be independently wealthy from accidentally finding a flower that was able to transport you backwards and forwards within the space time continuum.  anyways, i'm not going to seattle because- i need to go to new york to visit carole.  this is a priority.  also, while i do have three hundred dollars, i need it for other things.  like going to new york, or eating.  if i do go to seattle again, i want chris to go, too.  and as far as traveling with nikki?  i think her incessant chatter might wear me out by the middle of the first day, if not by the end of the flight there.  which is about four hours.  and who knows what this javier kid is like.  his boots might not even be all that enviable, for all i know.

          yesterday, i met a celebrity.  not jim carrey, but the dog- the dog that was in "the mask" and "my dog skip" and various coach commercials.  you know coach, they sell ugly handbags for something like six hundred bucks a pop.  anyhow, i met this dog and it was an odd moment indeed.  here was an animal, a goddamn *dog*, that had already accomplished more in life than i ever would.  i'm not going to be in a jim carrey movie.  my likeness isn't going to be used to sell purses.  not to mention, i was willing to bet that the dog had more cash than i did.  all in all, it was very depressing indeed.

       i need to figure out how to become independently wealthy within the next month or so.  i'd like to invent something, run a few info-mercials, and proceed watch the money roll in.  i want to accidentally discover another periodic element- but not a radioactive one.  something fun.  or i want to sue somebody for upwards of a quarter of a billion dollars.  i don't want to have to come down with any disease in order to sue; i don't, for damn sure, want to suffer psychological damage or have a lot of scarring in my uterus.  i don't want to work.  at all.  maybe if i could figure out exactly what i wanted to do, then that would be a different story.    I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. You know, as a career, I don't want to do that.    ditto.  it's a shame i don't know how to kickbox.  one day i'll be satisfied with what i'm doing for a job.  until then, i'll continue to not be satisfied.  at all.

       the guy who's cutting the grass looks a little like tom petty.  yesterday at work, my coworker joanne fainted.  she's diabetic and often has "episodes," but this was the first one i'd ever seen.  i looked up while making a phone call and saw her laying on the floor.  the first thing i thought was, "why the hell is she laying down?"  the second thing i thought was, "do i get to lay down too?"  frankly, i was a little pooped from remaining erect all day.  heh, there's a sentence.  anyways, the third thing i thought was, "boy, she has some fucking nerve."  then, the fourth thing i thought when i saw my manager run over to her repeating "oh god, oh god," was, "i'm a really big asshole."  because it did not occur to me that she had passed out until that moment, a full minute or two after i had noticed that she was on the floor.  i guess i'm a little slow at times.  also, grossly insensitive.

       today is my birthday.  my mother gave me a card with 12 dollars worth of starbucks gift certificates inside.  she never ceases to amaze me.  i know those certificates are a totally recycled gift; she's probably had them in her wallet for over 2 years now, but it must be difficult for her to go out and buy coffee with such a rigid tv-watching schedule.  sigh.  she also gave me some gum.  it saddens me that even with her own daughter, she's the cheapest lady alive, but i guess if i try to understand.....  oh well, fuck it.  i'm 23.

       i've started reading "catch 22."  i've started reading chris' copy of "catch 22," which was published in 1965 and smells like the closeted sweater of some dead old lady.  the pages are properly yellowed, and i'm sure that by the time i'm finished, i'll have to reassamble the book with rubber bands and bubble gum.  i'm hard on the books i read.  usually, i get mustard in them.  anyways, why i'm bring this up is because i came across the word "infundibuliform" while reading.  and after practicing saying it aloud a few times, i tried to guess what it might mean.  i came up with "formed like something fun," "a boring, gimpy bull," and "in dire need of a large peach smoothie."  here's what it really means.   infundibuliform    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (nfn-dby-l-frm) adj.  Shaped like a funnel.    my goal is to use this word today in a sentence.  i already have the sentence.  "that funnel is infundibuliform."  i don't have a funnel, though.... so, shit, there goes that.

          a while ago, i painted this painting that maybe you've heard of it.  i called it "starry night," after my good friend bob "the starry night" macdonald.  he was the main inspiration for this painting because he was the one who motivated me to actually do something with my life.  "you should make something," he'd always say.  "and you should shut up," i'd say, because usually i was in the middle of something when he told me this, like writing a child-support check or trying to get the cap off of a 40.  "make something," he'd repeat.  "like what?" i'd finally ask.  it was no secret that i'd dropped out of carpentry school three years earlier after accidentally nailing my professor's foot to the bumper of a buick.  "you know i don't have it in me."  "you do," bob "the starry night" macdonald would insist.  "write something, like a haiku about social injustices.  or paint something, like a portrait of me."  "a portrait of me?"  "no, a portrait of *me*."  "a portrait of you."  i've never been good at drawing faces.  the noses always get me all tied into knots, unless i just draw it as a triangle.  most people understand that it's supposed to be a nose if it's a triangle, but the art world doesn't always like that.  or so i've heard.  so i drew a landscape instead.  i said to bob, "your portrait is done."  "that's a landscape."  "well, you're as big as a landscape."  "shut up."  "no, you shut up."  then my friend lorraine "the mountains at saint-remy" cortez showed up.  so i drew a portrait of her as well.

            this is wolf blitzer, from cnn.  now, when i think of the name "wolf blitzer," i think of some ultra cool, leather jacket wearing, mystery solving, babe-getting superhero.  the name "wolf blitzer" is just.... awesome.  and this guy, sadly enough, doesn't do his name even an ounce of the justice that it deserves.

       yesterday, chris and i went over to my manager's grace's house to look at her computer, which she's been having problems with.  grace is from poland, and she sometimes has problems understanding english and speaking to tech support on the telephone, so she enlisted our help.  basically, we were there for an hour and a half only to discover that she had simply just forgotten her passwords.  actually, the one password she was typing in wasn't working because she was using the numeric key pad without the num lock on and the other password was one that she had created a few months ago and simply forgotten, until our gentle coaxing led her to remember.  we were there for an hour and a half "working" on it.  in that hour and a half, chris uninstalled one of the programs for which the password would unlock.  then, eventually, she recalled her password.  we left, and she thanked us profusely for helping, even going as far as to offer us money.  we refused, of course, and then once outside, chris said, "christ, we didn't even do anything.  except, of course, for deleting her firewall-  something, mind you, that she paid for."  now, maybe it's just me, but i find that rather humorous.  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  today i worked in the dr's office.  usually, i work on the retail side of things, selling glasses and whatnot.  contacts, you see, are totally foreign to me, despite the fact that i wear them.  so today i had to work with two new wearers, and i have to give myself points for being honest.  "they say you're only supposed to wear these contacts for twelve hours at a time, but you could probably go days on end with them in.  that twelve hour thing is kind of an old wives' tale, like not swimming after eating."  "these are two week contacts.  mine are two week contacts, too- but let me tell you something, sir.  i don't throw mine out until a solid three months have gone by, at least.  like, if you buy a year supply today, it could possibly last you for the better part of a decade."  ah, i'm such a model for good eye health.  if the doctor ever hears me.... also, if a lifeguard ever hears me.... i hear the not swimming after eating thing is still debatable.

       chris and i went to a french restaurant last night.  our appetizer was a crab cake that we shared that was no larger than the size of my palm.  this lone crab cake cost eight dollars.  my entree was steak.... and shoe string french fries.  only i can go to a nice restaurant and end up with fries.  of course, they were french, but after my food came, i felt like i might as well have ordered a hot dog.  not that the steak wasn't good- but it wasn't something that you should go to a french restaurant for.  from now on, i decree that when i go out to eat, i will only order the most ethnic, bizarre, never-even-heard-of-it-before entrees that i can find.  or i'll get that hot dog.

       halloween party.  here.  november 1.  all hallow's day, actually.  will be dressed up as....  shit, what do people dress up for as halloween these days?  when i was a kid, my mom was really cheap about costumes, so i had to be the same thing for about three years in a row.  i can remember two three year series.  the first three years, i was a punk rocker.  this involved star shaped glasses, a glitter gold wig, and heeled shoes.  not really anything that had to do with being a punk, or rocking- basically, i was a badly dressed grade school whore.  the next three years i was a clown.  i think i may have recycled the old star-shaped glasses.  one year, my mother made me a sandwich board that looked like a playing card- and so i was the ace of diamonds.  the ace of diamonds, in her sandwich board, had a hard time sitting down that year.  sigh.  i think this year i'll just pick one of my alter egos and go as her.  sylvia's quite sweethearted, but toby's a nympho, mary-lou's a klepto, and then there's babs, who has a strange powdered cheese fetish.  we've got rita the prescription drug housewife and angela, whose voice gets high and screechy when she talks about communicable diseases.  it's a fun bunch.  i've got chuck p's "diary" sitting on my table.  i have another book, "strong motion" by jonathan franzen, to read before i get to "diary," but i'm ashamed to admit that i'm not necessarily looking forward to it.  chuck's got this thing where he latches onto  one formula phrase and repeats it for about 200 pages.  and while some formula phrases, like the ones in "mystery men," are kind of neat, others are just extraordinarily obnoxious.  speaking of which, i need a formula phrase.

       matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match....  i'm setting nikki up with dr. eric from my store.  this could go either way.  i should know better than to set her up with anyone i know, just because she has a habit of dumping guys without ever actually telling them, but, on the other hand, maybe they'll really get along.  i mean, i'm sure they'll get along, at least for about ten minutes.  twenty minutes may be pushing it.  so i tell nikki and val about dr. eric while we're out on sunday.  then this morning, val calls me and says that she went out last night and met a doctor from my store.... dr. eric himself.  this is bizarre for about ninety different reasons.  what are the odds that val would meet this guy, who lives an hour away from her, only three days after being told about him?  talk about random.  maybe it's a sign of some sort.  of course, that sign would be more like dr. eric is actually meant for val, but a sign is a sign, even if it's a fucked up sign.

       still drunk.  thinking of people i'm never going to see again.  gee, how sad it gets.  i tried calling heather today at her new store.  she wasn't there.  and then they said, "but kevin's here," and i said, "kevin caldwell?"  and they said, "no, kevin ryan."  and i don't know anyone named kevin ryan.  so i hung up.  i thought of my old friend chrissy lately, co-creator of the "bizarro movies" we used to film.  i wonder what ever happened to her.  i swear to god if she goes public with our bizarro movies and doesn't seek me out to give me a cut of the profits, i'll sue every last pink strand of hair on her head.  and then i'll beat her with her own lonely towel.  still listening to liz phair.  i should take up guitar.

       i'm drunk.  sometimes, during the day when i'm not drunk, i'll come up with all these great ideas.  like, i can almost remember one now.  but then when i drink massive liquid quantities, i try to remember my good ideas, and they just seem dumb.  everything seems dumb.  except for liz phair, because she's always great.  i got blue contacts today.  so i am blue-eyed.  i think it makes me 15% sexier.  i've got this down to a science.  now i just need to get those hot pants.  a relevant quote from chris:  "hot pants are only as hot as the ass that they're on."  truly, he's a man beyond his times.

       i've been doing a lot of crossword puzzles lately, and i think i'm ready to write one.  now i don't know any crossword writers personally, but i imagine they must be a ton of fun at parties, what with knowing all those useless facts.  imagine, everyone's sitting around discussing the boring things that people discuss, such as who's dying of what and where you got those shoes, when the crossword writer cuts in and mixes things up a little.  "do you know a six letter word for the last half foot of your large intestine?  it's rectum."  at which point the crossword writer's sidekick can yell, "rectum?  it nearly killed him!!"  you have to be very smart to write a crossword puzzle, or else have a lot of time and reference material at your disposal.  i once read a fluff piece in the newspaper about a crossword writer who proposed to his girlfriend by mixing the words "LOVE YOU FOREVER NICOLE MARRY ME STEVE" into the puzzle.  this really could have backfired.  what if nicole didn't do the crossword that morning?  or what if she did it and just didn't notice the hidden message?  worse, what if her name was barbara, and not nicole?  schemes like that can go horribly wrong.

       chris and i just saw a squirrel hanging on to the side of the building, near the roof.  "how's he doing that?"  chris wanted to know.  we watched his little paws grasping and scraping against the brick and the gutters in what seemed to be desperation. we were enraptured by this show.  then, at the last second, the poor thing slipped and fell right off, hitting the boards of the porch with an almighty *thump*.  silence followed.  "do you hear scurrying?" i asked chris, "because i don't hear scurrying."  chris went to investigate.  the squirrel wasn't moving, but his eyes were blinking.  his life was probably flashing before his eyes.  he was seeing trees and flowers, female squirrels and big bowls of clusters cereal.  in memorandum:  stanley squirrel, ????- 2003.

       christmas decorations are up in the mall.  may i remind you that, technically, it's still summer.  this irks me to no end.  i don't want to hear about christmas until it's officially december.  and then i want to hear about it in only in vague passing.  my dad asked last night what our plans were for thanksgiving.  again, technically it is still summer.  why such a rush to get through the seasons?  why do the department stores start stocking winter coats in august?  why do the 2004 calendars start showing up in april of 2003?  has the whole world gone mad?  anyhow, i have to go.  i'm meeting with some friends this morning to plan my party for new years.... 2010.

       my parents are coming to dinner tomorrow.  first thing i need to do is get rid of all of the cigarette butts on the porch.  second thing i need to do is make chris bury all the dead hookers.  not just because my parents are coming- but i think, overall, the bodies are disrupting the flow of chi.  chris joked that we should have both of our sets of parents over tomorrow.  he has a point; they will have to meet eventually.  here's the thing, though.  i am wildly embarrassed of my mother.  she's like my dirty little secret.  if chris' mother meets her, she will no doubt pull chris aside and say, "run like hell, boy.  the acorn can't possibly fall that far from the tree."  either that, or she'll grow to like me more, because i am an obviously a strong individual for having overcome such horrid adversity.  my mother doesn't have any tact.  cosmo kramer has more tact.  so does an a-bomb.  she's crass; she thinks inappropriate things, and then she just spits them out.  there's no filter.  either way, just my parents are coming tomorrow.  cigarette butts.  dead hookers.  i'm sure there's something else i'm forgetting, but i'm sure i'll remember just after it's almost too late.  if you're following me.

       so it seems that this dark eyed girl with a penchant for good cheese and elvis costello records dating pre- burt bacharach is going to do this.  after looking for other jobs, after getting a degree, she's going to simply take a promotion at her current optical.  the money will be good, at least.  not to mention, she knows what she's doing when it comes to optics.  and as far as being a good manager?  she knows what it's like to be under a *bad* manager, so it would seem to add up that she'd know what not to do, therefore knowing *exactly* what to do.  huh.  that's the same logic she applies to her mother.  her mother was a bad mother- therefore our eyeball connouisseur heroine will one day be a GREAT mother.  anyhow, after my job hunt, after waiting over a year after graduating, what i'm simply doing is moving ahead at lenscrafters.  funny, huh?  originally, it was supposed to just be a part time job to have while in college in order to make some going-to-the-movies, need-some-new-sneakers cash.  now, it seems it may be a... career.  oh well.  it really is good money.  and i get free eyewear.  i got my fourth set of free glasses yesterday; they're plastic, and boy do i look intellectual in them.

       i'm reading a book by isaac asimov.  this is the second isaac asimov book i've read, and once again the universe is in great peril.  this book concerns energy.  when i was in third or fourth grade, i learned that the universe only contains a limited amount of energy, and one day we would run out of it.  this kept me awake at night.  during the day, as well, i would try to sit as absolutely still as i could, just to not waste any energy.  i think i was a little paranoid.  anyhow, i'm really hoping that there's some time travel in this book, because i perk up at the thought of traveling through time.  along with time travel, i'm a big fan of mars.  any book that involves time traveling while on mars would automatically get the thumbs up from me.  really, it doesn't take much.

       so i have a job interview on tuesday, and yesterday i recieved a phone call about another job.  however, since i was working, i had to play a very unprofessional game of phone tag with the gentleman who called me and, alas, never did get to actually speak to him.  hopefully, we'll talk on monday.  however, i have been thinking, and a plan has formed itself within my head.  i just now got done completing a survey that may win me 25,000.  there's an abundance of surveys like this, and raffles, and contests.  if i enter every single one of them, i'm bound to win something.  in fact, my twpy (total winnings per year) will probably average about 32,500.  i could easily live off of 32,500, thus solving my problem of having to work.  i am one smart cookie.  now i have to get ready for work. it's sunday.  who works on sunday?  me.  it's the sabbath, i really should be at a prayer service of some sort.  or watching the "three's company" marathon on tvland.

           john ritter is dead.  this is awful news, because john ritter, as jack tripper, was rather like a second father to me.   "three's company" shaped me into who i am; come to think of it, i don't know if that's good or bad.  my mom had all the episodes on tape, and, as a kid, i used to watch them on continuous loop during days when my own dad was sleeping and the only activities i could engage in were quiieeet ones.  of course my uproarious laughter at the hilarity that often ensued with jack, janet, and the blonde wasn't always quiet, but then we'd just pause the tape and i'd take up coloring for a while.  as you can see, my childhood was rich with...... anyways, john ritter is dead, and what this says about the delicate balance of life and not life is downright bone-chilling.  shit, now i feel like i have to color.  but i'm not coloring the berenstein bears, because i could never figure out where their fur ended.  before you knew it, the whole page was brown.

       well, it's 9/11 again.  last year's 9/11 made me rather hate everybody; i remember in particular one woman in an american flag t-shirt, fdny hat, and star-spangled pin who deliberately cut in front of me in line at the movies.  the thing about today- and i do have yet to leave the house- is that everybody's going to be so proud of themselves for being so fucking patriotic and compassionate- when the truth is, they're still the same assholes they always were, only now they feel they have a "cause."  9/11 is not a holiday like fucking independence day.  it's a time of grieving, and, in my opinion, it's a time of grieving only for those who lost somebody.  the rest of everyone else can go fuck themselves.    i do add:  it's one thing to have respect and reverence; it's another thing to be some jerk who tries to flaunt it.  however, i am going to punch anyone wearing an american flag t-shirt today.

       i did leave the doctor's office with pills on tuesday; the very nice dr. walker was quick to prescribe xanax and then give me a three week supply of paxil, of which i will more than likely get a refill.  now i know that there are a lot of stigmas associated with these drugs, but i've been doing a lot of thinking.  here are the facts.  i have terrible bouts of insomnia.  i get overemotional at times and cry about the smallest things.  occasionally, i have panic attacks, and also i have recurring feelings that there isn't a point to anything i try to do.  i can be very anti-social.  basically, i've known for quite a while (like, eight years) that i do, at times, exhibit the key signs of depression.  not all the time, granted.  i do want to give myself some credit.  the moods come and go, and i could be fine for months at a time until it all suddenly hits me again.  but after staying up all night on tuesday- and, on monday, being so ridiculously wound up that i couldn't even keep my food down- i realized that i can't live for those months when i'm fine, because the times when i'm not are awful.  so i'm willing to try these pills.  the xanax is a temporary solution to relax me if i can't sleep at night, and the paxil- if it works, i could be on it for years.  and i wouldn't mind being on it for years, if it actually helps.  i just need my brain to start being nice to me, and if there's something that this little chemical could do for me, then at this point in my life, i fully embrace it.  what it boils down to is that i'm great.  no, i mean really.  i'm fun, funny, smart, good with people... the only catch is when i get into one of my moods, then i'm nothing.  a blob of wasted flesh.  but if one little pill helps with these moods, then i'll be super jackie all the time.  imagine all the things i could get done!  i don't know anyone else who takes paxil, so i have no one to talk to about this.  i remember when i was little, the doctor wanted to prescribe anti-depressants for my mother.  i got so upset when i found this out; i thought that it would turn her into some bizarro zombie.  in the end, she decided against it, and, looking back, maybe if she had taken something, then she would have been a little more human to her family.  because, as she was (and is), she's about the bizarro-est zombie you shall ever meet, if you're that unlucky to ever have to come in contact with her.  what it comes down to is that sometimes you need a little help.  that's nothing to be ashamed of.  and i want to do something to help myself now, before another six months roll around and i have a sleepless, down-and-out week or two that actually does push me over the edge.  the edge is not my friend.    so, this extremely personal entry that i just wrote is a toast to good times.  to feeling better.  and, speaking of toasts and things that make me feel better, i believe i'm going to go now and pour myself a drink.

       i am still not one of blogger's "blogs of notes."  today i called in sick to work.  really, i probably could have gone.  i was supposed to go to the west dundee store to help out there, so at least i screwed over people i didn't know as opposed to people i have to see all the time.  i've been vomiting, i can't sleep, i haven't eaten, and although i don't know which drugs i'd like to try, i'm sure i'd like to leave the dr's office today with *some* kind of bottle of pills.  even if they're tic tacs.  i've never been to this dr. before, because this is the first time since living in this area that i've needed to go and see one.  i rejected one woman doctor based on the fact that her last name sounded "funny."  now i'm going to see dr. walker.  it's kind of like a blind date.  i already feel comfortable with him, though, since there's an off-chance he could be related to alice walker, acclaimed author of "the color purple" and "possessing the secret of joy," two must reads for anyone even remotely literate.  sigh.  this should be good.

       at miller stadium last night, there were more cub fans than brewers fans.  of course, i wore my brewers hat because i'm such a richie sexson fan.  sidenote:  until last night, i thought he was black.  anyhow, back to miller stadium.  it's great.  you don't have to be a baseball nut to enjoy racing sausages, FUNNEL CAKE, and the fact that the beer guy offered me lemon wedges.  lemon wedges.  i think that's rather fancy (pinky UP).  miller park has a beer garden with a live band playing before and after the game.  it has a mascot that goes down a twisty slide.  a tgi friday's.  a hot tub where four lucky fans get to soak in during the game.  a retractable roof.  fireworks.  racing sausages.  it took us an hour, probably an hour fifteen, to get out of the parking lot.  what poor planning on somebody's part to have six lanes of traffic merging into one lane of traffic that apparently led into a solid brick wall.  i like going to brewers' games.  i like seeing chris' face light up at the thought of bratwurst.  i'm liking planning next year's outings- going to the game, hanging out in milwaukee, driving to the dells or - one of my top ten-  urlLink the house on the rock .  this place is great.  apparently the creator, alex jordan, smoked four packs of cigarettes a day until he eventually keeled over.  i know this much is true.  the infinity room is awesome.

       let me tell you about the tubmans.  now that's not their real name, but it's the name that i've given them in my head.  i think it fits, but only because "tubman" seems to conjure images of dumpy fat-asses, at least for me.  these are the people who live above us.  mr. and mrs. tubman are quite large, and the floor squeaks with their every movement. their bedroom is right above us; sometimes i can hear the bed squeaking, rhythmically, and every morning i am awakened with the sounds of the tubmans getting *out* of bed- it sounds like quite an ordeal.  then i hear them walk across the room towards the bathroom.   pound, pound, pound , go their feet.  the tubmans also have a dog.  the dog runs around all day, and i'm convinced that they feed it nothing but pixie sticks and red bull.   ba-dum-ba-dum-ba-dum  goes the dog.  the tubmans have a daughter who's about 16, and while she's not fat now, you can kind of see it in her.  the future holds awful things for the teenaged tubman.  this tubman jumps around her bedroom a lot, listening to alanis morissette, because she's also fed nothing but pixie sticks and red bulls.  when she comes downstairs, she always stops to talk to us.  she doesn't have much to say, and yet the yakking is incessant.   yak yak yak , goes the teenaged tubman.  the creaking of the ceiling alarms me.  i fear one day, the ceiling may cave and we may be stuck with mr. and mrs. tubman (who weigh no less than six hundred pounds together), the hyper dog, and the yakkity yakkity teenaged tubman- all on top of us.  and you know what they would do, after the dust from the plaster settled?  laugh.  mrs. tubman has a horridly obnoxious laugh.  the dog would lick our faces, and the teenaged tubman?  she'd belt out, "i want you to know... that i'm happy for you... i wish nothing but... the best for you both....."  a la alanis m.  oh, just thinking about it is both scary and painful.

       new obsession:  the travel channel.  yesterday was san francisco.  today, london.  i can't watch shows on these places without aching to go.  i wonder if the travel channel is hiring.  i could travel abroad and interview the locals from thousands of locations and also act as food/theater/shopping critic.  i could go to every tourist attraction and museum and castle and natural wonder and make witty comments about all of my findings for various aired specials.  while i'm not willing to learn new languages, i am willing to use a flex spending account to accumulate lots of key chains, souvenirs, and "somebody in (budapest) loves me t-shirts."  i'm willing to make new friends all over the usa and especially abroad, and then proceed to get my new friends completely shit-faced.  i'll interview anybody.  i'll handle the crown jewels and stand dangerously close to geysers and volcano tops.  oh, how i want to go to pittsburgh and try that cheesesteak sandwich that includes the fries and the coleslaw *between* the bread.  i'd also like to do research on how long it takes for water balloons to hit the ground when thrown from the roofs of various famous landmarks....i want to smuggle exotic birds back into the country from places like brazil and new guinea.  yes, this is a job i feel i can do.  if anybody from the travel channel is reading this, contact me and i'll fax you my resume.

       and gosh-darn it, people like me.  today a letter was recieved at my store.  "after several frustrating attempts to correct my eyewear, i finally decided to come in one last time before giving up and returning my glasses.  your associate jackie was quickly able to pinpoint my problem and make me a new set of lenses that worked well after several of your other associates were unable to help.  i feel that jackie is one of the most competent employees your company has and also would like to add that working with her was an enjoyable experience due to her upbeat personality and the manner in which she handled my problem and was able to put me at ease."  i have to record this, because it's ... awesome.  more people should write letters to companies, especially when they concern me.  unless they have something bad to say.  like, if a letter said, "your associate jackie seemed to have no idea what i was talking about and, on several occasions, managed to insult both my taste in clothing and the manner in which i combed over my hair," then i could probably do without.  i urge you.  as a consumer, be an active letter writer.  you just may be the bright spot in an otherwise dimly lit afternoon.

       we went to the cubs game today.  now, originally, i thought that there were only 7 innings in a baseball game, but it turns out there's 9.  this, quite frankly, seems like an awful lot on its own-  *but,* in today's game, there ended up being 15 innings.  now i'm no baseball girl, but, damn, don't you think that's a bit insane?  if i were playing on a baseball team, and we were in, say, inning 10, i'd intentionally throw the game just so that i could get the hell out of there and maybe shower and have a hoagie.  you just don't want a game to have to go into double digit innings....  especially since they don't sell beer after the 7th.  gee, maybe that's why i thought the game was over after 7.  this is the 3rd cubs game i've been to in my entire life.  i went to 3 *white sox* games last summer alone.  now, i was raised on the south side and therefore am supposed to root for the sox, yet here i've been transplanted to the north side.   my father's threatened to give me up for adoption if i start liking the cubs, but i'm torn because of my location and the fact that my boyfriend's a die-hard cubs fan....  wait, who am i kidding?  oh, i'm so funny.  i'm not a fan of any baseball team, except maybe the brewers since i look so good in their baseball cap.  (also, chris has taught me several richie sexson facts so that when people comment on my hat, i can say, "yeah.  the brewers.  that richie sexson is one hell of a [ look at notecards ] first basemen.")  the bottom line is that i don't get most of baseball, only enjoy going to the games for the hotdogs, and the fact that i'm thinking about which team i need to like is absolutely laughable.  it's like mitsubishi sitting down and trying to decide which flavor of hot sauce they should start selling.  because mitsubishi sells cars.  not hot sauce.  come on, i thought you knew that.  oh, baseball.  i do like going to the games, but for all the wrong reasons, like my aforementioned hot dog.  friday, chris and i are going to milwaukee to watch the cubs/brewers.  we have seats in bernie's terrace, which is near where the mascot hangs out.  did you know that the mascot has a slide he gets to go down?  i'm hoping that if i'm really good, they'll let me go down it, too.

          **************************************  happy halloween.  i've been up all night checking the candy bars for razors; i don't want to be held responsible for some personal vendetta of the guy at the snickers' factory.  you know how it is.  yeah, i'm talking to you.  i really don't want to go to work today, but aside from purposely breaking my ankle, there are few ways i can get out of it.  i mean, i suppose i could call in sick, but that would be a little transparent.  i'd have to prove i really couldn't come in to work.  such as showing them the bill for my broken ankle.  i've always admired people who could break their own bones for the good of the bigger picture.  like, you're stuck in handcuffs and the only way to get out is to break your wrist.  so you do it.  and now you have this great story to tell at bars for the rest of your natural life.  my dad came up to my store to buy glasses yesterday, and get an exam.  he drove an hour just to come to *my* store.  that's my dad, always going out of his way to see his darling daughter.  we went to lunch on my piddly half hour lunch break, and he told me that sometimes he takes lunches that last as long as 3 1/2 hours.  that once he drove 30 miles away on his lunch break just to have a certain kind of taco, and that he and this other guy normally frequent best buy on their lunch breaks.  this is the kind of job i need.  you go out for lunch and decide you also have time to get your hair highlighted, buy some authentic wisconsin cheese, and then sit down and reconsolidate your loans.  or something.  i don't know.  i wish i could snap my fingers and make a plate of french toast appear.

       if i had to choose one word to describe myself this morning, it would be "pukey."  if i had to use two words, it would "pukey" and "headachy."  so last night this guy tim stopped by.  he's jordan's friend, and unbeknownst to us, jordan's told this guy that he could possibly sublet his room.  i guess it only makes sense; according to ocean's count, jordan's only been here 3 of the last 4,569 hours.  or something like that.  it might be kind of weird if this guy moves in, but i guess he seemed mild-mannered enough, which is always good.  personally, i don't care as long as he can pay the rent and maybe do the dishes once in a while.  but, you know, it's still a somewhat odd situation.  not to mention, it's been nice living with just chris and ocean.  the three of us have a certain rhythm together that may or may not be upset by this guy.  like, what if tim watches tv naked and listens to polka music until four in the morning?  then again, maybe he'll enhance that rhythm by contributing a blender or something.  we don't have a blender.  anyways.  my dad gave me a printer yesterday.  that was nice of him, because it's now been five months that i've been printer-less.  this is going to be a key step in my burgeoning career as a famous novelist.  now all i need is a stapler.  and an idea for a novel.  if had to pick a third word to describe myself this morning, it would be "ultra," as in "ultra pukey," and "ultra headachy."

       oh how i manage to amuse myself.  i'm at my parents' house right now, going through some more of my old stuff, and i found this file on one of my long lost floppy discs.  this is from the archives, friends, circa 1997.  and i like it.    dinner date  the potato, looking sexy, wore her sour cream and chives. the steak was truly captivated by her many eyes. he wanted so to taste her; so he chased her round the plate. the potato was a tad turned off by her pushy, beefy date. she threw a little corn at him and other bits of tiny food as a subtle way of saying that she wasnt in the mood. besides, she said, i like the bread, he really has nice buns. the steak got rather jealous and he said the date was done. i wish id never met you, said the piece of bloody meat, i cant believe youd rather have a lousy hunk of no good wheat! he was overheard, of course, by the ear of corn who told the bread, who promptly wished that he never had been born. im on a roll, the bread cried out, i will never get my break! secretly, the bread was gay and really had it for the steak. so all three were very sad, each alone and feeling beaten. it didnt matter anyhow. in they end, they all got eaten.

        urlLink this article  is great for a number of reasons.  like two.  the first reason it's great is this:   "You were drunk while cutting up Morris Black?" prosecutor Kurt Sistrunk asked.   "I hope so, yes, sir," Durst responded.    and the second reason is this:   Durst, who sometimes posed as a mute woman while living on Galveston Island...   he posed as a mute woman?  for fun?  to meet mute guys?  because he was a transvestite but knew his own voice was much too masculine to pass as a lady's?  and this is so random; it has next to nothing to do with the murder....  or does it?  maybe this article should have been called,   "eccentric millionaire goes into alcohol induced killing spree after nobody believes he's a chick"   just something to think about, really.

        urlLink this website  told me that my ideal place to live is norfolk, virginia.  this is a little upsetting considering i was trying to skew my answers towards seattle.  who the fuck am i, though, to doubt what a website tells me?  everything on the internet is true.  anyhow, i've been doing some research on norfolk, virginia, and i think they might be on to something.       it's on the ocean.  it has a big arts community.  the weather is temperate.  no snow, fellows!  it's safe, with a low crime rate.  the cost of living is lower than the national average.  i checked out some apartments, and you wouldn't believe the finds i ... found.  it's also home to a university, and i'd probably get to go sailing every once in a while.  i told chris that norfolk was where i was supposed to live.  and he said, "guess we're moving to norfolk."  i think i'm going to retake that quiz a few more times, though.  i am still kind of thinking about seattle.  it would have been funny if the quiz results would have kept me squarely in the chicago suburbs.  funny, but heartbreakingly sad.

       i found a dog year calculator on line.  apparently, a dog that is 56 years old is actually, in dog years, 392 years old.  could you imagine the benefits a dog this old would recieve?  a human that's 56 still has to work.  but a dog that was 56, being 392, would probably recieve not only a fat social security check every month, but also some kind of trophy.  i never understood dog years.  what's the point?  who came up with such an idea?  an internet search yielded nothing except another cut and paste dog calculator that i tried desperately to add to my blog, but to no avail.  how cool would my blog be if i had a dog year calculator?    anyways, i have to put something up.  so here's a japanese comic book called "armpit care."  those crazy japanese.  i'll never understand them, at least not fully.

       several years ago, i went to the doctor because my lymph nodes were swollen.  the only problem was that i, for some reason, would always confuse the words "lymph nodes" with the word "gonad."  so i went to the doctor and said, "my gonads are swollen."  he gave me a really wierd look and said, "your what are swollen?"  "my gonads," i repeated, gesturing towards my throat.  "oh," he said, relieved.  "those are your lymph nodes."  and when i realized my mistake, i was eternally embarrassed.  ****************************************************************************  two days ago, there was one squirrel on the porch.  yesterday, there were two.  this morning, i saw three.  i'm beginning to think that squirrels are further along in the cloning process than we are.  and it makes me mad.

       we have sim golf and sim city and sim theme park and sim coaster.  i tried playing the sims, but had trouble getting my sims to find jobs and not want to spend all day trying to catch the other sims in the shower.  what's nice about the sim set is that if you screw up a life or a landscape or an entire metropolis, then all you have to do is start over.  really, this is the premise of all video games, and it's upsetting that in real life we don't get to do this.  i've been searching for a reset button for about six years now.  although i wouldn't want to start completely over.  like, if i pressed the reset button, i'd still want to wake up next to chris- but just have another opportunity to clean the shower before the mildew got so out of control.  it's the little things that i'd want to change, not the whole picture.  maybe last night i would have had a sandwich instead of pasta?  maybe i'd have worn purple yesterday instead of black?  how would i be different *today*?  oh lord.  shut me up.  anyhow, my feeling about the sim games is that they're not realistic enough.  if you play sim golf, there's no chance of chipping your tooth on a putter.  if you play sim theme park, you don't get to lose your sandle on the roller coaster.  if you play the sims, your mother doesn't call to yell at you.  which is nice.  and i can't remember where i'm going with this entry.

       i miss amelia bedelia.  now that was a woman that i could identify with.  i saw "lost in translation" last night.  it wasn't what i thought it would be, and at first i was disappointed in it.  on further contemplation, though, i think i'd have to admit that it was a really, really good movie, mostly because it prompted the further contemplation.  i think i was disappointed at first because of the lack of action- but that's just it.  that's what most of life is, the sitting around in your underwear and sight-seeing while trying to "feel" something and looking out a window when you should be sleeping.  meeting a stranger in a slow, random way, rather than a big, dramatic way.  listening to motivational cds and doing bad karaoke.   my favorite part of the movie: "let's try 'mixed internal.'"

       i've decided that i'd like to write an advice column.  this is not because i feel like i'm knowledgeable and worldy and have so much wisdom i need to share.  oh no, my friend, it's because i think it would be fun to read about other people's problems.  also, i'd like to be in a position to dispense bad advice without ever having to deal with the outcome.  ah, but i jest.  really, i'd like to write an advice column because i need a writing *prompt*, and having to respond to a question would give me that prompt.  now i need a shtick.  urlLink  "savage love"  is relatively brilliant, but, alas, it's also relatively taken.  i know a lot about eyeglasses, but who's going to want to read a column full of questions from "nosepadless in north dakota" and "bifocal blues in biloxi?"  certainly not anyone i'd care to talk to.  there are way too many "family" advice columnists, and there are also way too many "i like this boy, what should i do?"  advice columnists- although, if your target market is fifteen year olds, then there's really no other way to go.  and etiquette?  that would be laughable; my father has several times threatened to send me to finishing school due to too much burping, chomping with my mouth open, and picking at various pimples during fancy ceremonial dinners.  to which i was probably wearing dirty tennis shoes and clown socks.  anyhow, i've been thinking about this all morning, and the only thing i have is a column on talking your way out of anything.  like, you've done something wrong, and now you need a really good excuse.  i think i can provide this excuse.  i can help the wayward excuse themselves from messes of their own creation.... again, i'm not saying i'm necessarily qualified to do this, because i'm the first person to admit when i'm even 20% at fault, but it would be a fun endeavor.  don't you think?  so i'm going to call it "what you've done now," and officially invite questions and letters.  please.  i'm pretty hard up over here.    what you've done now an advice column by ms. here's-what-you've-gotta-do-next

       yet another "blog of note" has been added to blogger's list, and again it is not mine.  dan, it was really, really good to see you today.    how happy i am.  i had an excellent visit with my parents this morning.  i rather like the way our relationship is evolving.  this is mostly due to the fact that i rarely see them, although i will admit that i miss my dad a lot and wish i could see him a little more.  i got to make up with a good friend today, and i also got to see another good friend as well, and then be with the both of them and go to the thrift store.  this is where i picked up a bowling trophy for chris.  i am planning an elaborate ceremony in which to present him with it once he comes home.  i sure hope he likes the live band that i ordered.  they're tuning up in the kitchen now, which is where the caterer is putting together the cheese sculpture and chocolate milk fountain.  anyhow, what else can i say?  i am very pleased so far with the way today has gone.  although i am rather wishing i had gone to the patio for a sub sandwich.  if you're ever in the south suburbs of chicago, the patio is the place to eat.  i'm plugging them for free here, because this is an organization i truly believe in.  if only the owner would build one up here, i'd promise to eat there everyday.  and that's what i've got.  good day!

       what we currently have going on in the laundry room is three people, from one family, using all eight washers.  oh, they get me every time.  how are you?  i am fine.  not much is going on here.  i've been working a lot.  i can't wait to not work.  one day i hope to go out and do something besides work.  but we shall see.  that's all i have for today.  my boredom and frustration are seeping out into my blog entries.

       attention anyone planning on getting an eye exam today:  please, i beg of you, please cancel your appointment.  please.  didn't you know it's game 7 tonight of the cubs and marlins?  don't you want to stay at home and watch it?  you don't need an eye exam!  your vision is fine!  i couldn't read that stop sign either; the letters were painted to look kind of blurry and misshapen.  it's not you, it's the rest of the world that's gone mad.  please don't come into the doctor's office.  that throbbing in your eyelid is normal.  and that contact you have stuck in the side of your eye?  i'll tell you what you should do right now- deal with it!  please spend today doing something else.  maybe you should go shopping.  when's the last time you went to a museum, you uncultured prick?  oh, and the cubs game.  this is the northside, don't you know.  you'll be beaten if you don't watch the cubs.  please cancel.  or just don't show.  don't worry, i won't consider it bad manners.  the truth is, i just don't want to put up with you today, you with all your needs and problems.  you with your expired insurance card and your annoying questions like, "shouldn't you clean this off before you make me stick my face in it?"  "shouldn't you be writing this stuff down that i'm telling you?"  "shouldn't you be concerned that i appear to have no peripheral vision?"  ah, maybe tomorrow i can deal with your requests and issues.  but not today.  oh please not today.

        urlLink read an article about my favorite product.   another day, another half dollar.  i wrote a poem yesterday.  i spent over four hours working on it only to get up today, reread it, and decide that i hate it.  i am not a poet.  this is probably a good thing, because poets get a bad rap.  nobody likes a poet.  they say to the poet, "oh, you must hug plants and overanalyze rainbows."  you must compare family members to objects made of synthetic materials.  you must wet yourself when you discover you've accidentally created an internal rhyme.  chris' friend columbo, who you can link to through chris' blog, is promoting himself as a professional writer.  he offers to write screenplays and "treatments."  he charges an awful lot.  now, this is what i should get into.  let me know if you need a screenplay.  i won't charge quite as much, but i will charge something.  like two sandwiches and a candy bar.  three bagels and a cup of cocoa.  i could link to columbo's blog here, but that would require work beyond which i'm willing to put forth.  i've already linked to the pez article- isn't that enough?  how much do you expect from me anyhow?  i was never able to please you, was i?  i'm mildly intoxicated and would rather like to do a cartwheel.  instead i shall find something to untie.

       i thought that i should write about politics.  everybody's using their blogs to write about politics, and since i am one to so willingly jump onto the bandwagon, i thought that i too would give it a try.  i have decided to focus my attention on the politics of lincoln, nebraska.  while searching for material, i found this helpful website for the  urlLink lancaster county democratic party .  apparently, the party's major political upcoming event is an outing for the wedding anniversary of mark and terry.  no last names are given, because apparently lincoln is only home to one mark and one terry.  but they've been together for 28 years, and lord knows that's cause for celebration.  the celebration will include hot dogs.  also "junk food."  who lists "junk food" as a menu item?  i'll tell you who- those wacky, liberal lincoln, nebraska democrats.  it's a very informative web site.  they show pictures of their county party officers, and the chair is justin carlson, who, in his blue work shirt, looks like he was recently let out of a correctional institution.  and then there's jim johnson, the treasurer, who looks like he's posing for his senior high school yearbook picture.  anyhow, the one thing about actual lincoln politics that i found is a link to join the immigrant right network of iowa and nebraska.  lord knows the immigrants in iowa and nebraska need rights- they too should be allowed to eat hot dogs and junk food at the wedding anniversary of mark and terry.  i'm not trying to lead you to think that lincoln's not all that politically active.  they are open minded to the thoughts and needs of the world at large.  just ask steve, their swedish exchange student.  again, no last name.  this is because everyone knows steve, the kid from sweden with a major in u.s. politics who's surely kicking himself in the ass for deciding to take the internship in lincoln over the one in washingtion dc and the other one in new york.  so this is my first entry on politics.  join me next week when i explore the inner workings of warren, indiana.

       my dad fell asleep at the wheel and got into a car accident.  this after i have a dream alluding to my dad not being able to pick me up.  truly, i am psychic.  anyways, my dad's okay, but the car's messed up.  this worries me, my dad falling asleep while driving.  at his job, he operates heavy machinery that could easily catch fire if not watched.  what if my dad falls asleep at work and millions die in the resulting catastrophe?  also, what if it happens again, and he's not so lucky?  sometimes chris falls asleep while watching tv.  this worries me, too, as often while napping you can miss key plot twists.

       they called me back into the dr.'s office to say that i would be needed there 2-3 days per week.  uncle jesse, my general manager, tried to phrase it as "part of my development towards my advancement," but that's a load of garbage.  the real reason they want me back there is because i'm so tactful at delivering the results of the depth perception test.  me:  "0 out of 9.  so, let me get this straight- they let you have a driver's license?!?!?" patient:  "wow.  i really didn't get *any* of that right, huh?" me:  "nope."    i look down and realize that i have forgotten to press a key button during the test, therefore making the results completely innaccurate.    me: (not wanting to admit that i have done something wrong.)  "yep, no depth perception.  none.  also, i think you're color blind."  to make a short story shorter, i agreed.  what was i supposed to do?  i could barely concentrate on our conversation anyhow; the whole doctor's office seemed to smell like soy sauce, and i was trying my damndest to figure out why.  i looked at dr. w and tried to inspect her teeth for traces of rice that would indicate she'd been eating sushi.  i discretely attempted to sniff my own fingers as to jog my memory for whether or not  i'd  been eating any sushi.  i snuck another glance at uncle jesse, then thought, "nah, he's mexican.  mexicans don't eat sushi."  at least not self-respecting mexicans.  i have come home early nearly every day in the past two weeks.  my paycheck will soon reflect this.  i will no longer be able to live the high life; i may have to start mixing my hair conditioner out of beer and mayonnaise as to save a few bucks at the walgreens.  patient:  "what's that smell?" me:  "soy sauce." patient:  "no, that other smell." me:  "beer and mayonnaise." patient:  "coming from your  hair ?" me:  "hey, at least  i  can judge depth perception.  stupid."

       I read an article in the  Chicago Tribune  about how blogs are sources of new talent.  It goes into detail to explain how it's possible to go from simply writing in your own blog to being hired as the editor of  Vanity Fair .  Now, this is what I'm in this blog stuff for- besides, of course, the personal satisfaction.  If anyone would like to hire me to write for their publication, don't hesitate to contact me.  Unless your publication is a church bulletin- I do draw certain lines.  I even wrote this entry with correct capitalization, just to prove that I can.  See how serious I am about this?

       an open letter to chuck palahniuk, author of "diary:"  why did you waste my time with this book?  the only thing that i got out of reading your trite and overly-riddled-with-catch-phrases novel is that any author can be successful as long as they have one good book under their belt.  yours was "fight club," and now you have this massive following that you no longer deserve.  you should have stopped writing five years ago and committed your life to one of body-building and picking up girls at bars by pompously boasting, "ever hear of a little book called 'fight club?'  yeah, that's mine."  instead, you continue to make poor use of paper with your now predictable writing style and completely formulaic sentence structures.  you almost had a good plot this time.  ideas of fate and reincarnation are often eaten up by the public like handfuls of pie by a secret bulemic at three in the morning.  however, you failed by creating lifeless characters that nobody cared one way or the other about and the hokey fake letter at the end of the novel which attempted to make us feel that maybe your stupid story was true.  ooh, scary.  also, i'd like to add that the picture on the inside of the cover makes you look like a real asshole.  where'd you get that sweater from, lands end?  i am never reading another book by you again.  you are a disappoint to aspiring writers everywhere, because you have successfully proven that the authors who make a name for themselves are just recycling one idea over and over and over again.  you are john grisham and danielle steele.  you are the worst version of mary clark higgins and harlequin writers who are all working from a single brain cell.  you're lucky that i borrowed your book, instead of buying it.  if i had spent cash on this pile of excrement, you could be assured that i'd be flying out to toolsville, or wherever the fuck you live, to personally kick you in the teeth and pee on your sofa.  thank you.

       things that i have learned  1.  neil diamond and neil young are two completely different neils.  with different songs.  so if you were to buy a neil diamond cd looking for a neil young song, you'd be somewhat of a retard.  2.  a sandwich cut diagonally tastes three times better than a sandwich cut lengthwise down the middle.  3.  i should not bring coffee into the grocery store for the following reasons:       a.  it's impossible to push the cart while you're holding a cup, and i end up knocking into the elderly.      b.  spills are inevitable, especially in the produce section.  more accurately, *on* the produce section.      c.  the caffeine rush promotes random giggles at the names of various pasta shapes, which in turn promotes raised eyebrows.  4.  any guy that is hitting on me more than likely needs to borrow ten dollars.  5.  every religion is wrong, except for mine.  i know this is true because god has communicated with me through various hearty soup labels.  6.  clogged toilets make for awkward social situations and shyly embarrassed inquiries about the nature of your diet.  7.  the last thing you want to do is give your name and phone number to a representative of american express, because they will, i promise, call every four minutes.  it's as if they know you're lying when you say, "no, i'm not here right now, may i please take a message?"  8.  giving a kid a pet is a good way to teach them about life and death- especially if they're around to witness how you strangle it after it vomits on your lunch.  it's also a good way to teach kids not to vomit on someone else's sandwich; there will always be consequences.

            it's interesting how you can't see simon's other hand.  then, when you think about where that hand might be and look at sosa's face, it creates a kind of nightmarish vision.  also, i'm disturbed by simon's armpit hair.  i mean, all guys and some of the girls (this is a shout out to eastern europe) have pits like that, but it is beyond me how this population sect copes with that.  the cubs won last night, and i actually cared.  they say it's infectious, this baseball stuff.  in other news, the garbage strike means that the dumpster in our parking lot is both overfilled and surrounded with trash.  this is indicative of dumpsters everywhere, and when our good trash-carriers get back to work, they're going to be up to their own hairy armpits in it.   by "it," i mean everything from week-old poopy diapers to week old salami to week old non-flushable hygiene products to week old cheese to week old tissues.  so let's all hope they get that raise as to make those first few awful days at least sort of worth it.

       last night was the blind date, and it was a raging failure.  maybe not, i don't know.  here's how i feel, though- if i were dr. eric, i'd want to punch nikki in the face.  i don't know if she does it because she's nervous or if she really is as narcissistic as she comes across at times, but she would not stop talking about herself, how great she is, all the stuff she's done, this one time at this bar, this other time in her former jeep, etc, etc.  she didn't ask a single thing about him.  see, this is what you do on a first date.  you get to know each other.  this often requires expressing interest in not just yourself, but the dude you're out with.  i should write a dating manual.  i should call it "the fine line between wanting to hug you and wanting to beat you with the first blunt object he can find... and how to know when you've crossed it."  anyhow, i was annoyed most of the night.  it didn't help that i felt sick to begin with.  i think i may be dying of a yet to be named disease.  if it is yet to be named, i hope they don't call it jaclyn disease.  while i may one day want a rare breed of parakeet to be named after me, i don't think i'd be happy knowing that i was leaving this earth a legacy of tumors.  that's just not what i wanted to do.

        chapter seventeen   "don't tell me.  let me guess."  "you're never going to get it," i replied, hanging up the telephone.  "let me just tell you-"  "no, i want to guess!"  javy's face was the color of insistence, which is a light maroon.  "was that the test results?"  i sank into a chair and stuck a muffin into my mouth.  "brrgh berr err bugh uhh," i replied, spraying crumbs into the air.  javy, with a quick motion, caught the muffin bits before they hit the floor, and then pressed them into his cupped hands, managing to create a smaller muffin.  watching him with raised eyebrows, i swallowed and stated, "it's amazing how you do that."  "i'm an amazing guy," javy replied, sculpting the muffin into a detailed model of a 1997 honda civic coupe, with a spoiler and a little yellow leaf hanging from the rearview mirror. "so the test results.  let me guess."  "fine.  they were the test results.  so guess already.  i do have things to do, you know."  i glanced over to table, upon which was heaped six years worth of laundry, nine months worth of dishes, and three pets that i'd been meaning to bury.  javy's face crinkled into the shape of a question mark.  he began to pace back and forth, rubbing his nose thoughtfully and muttering aloud, "malignant.  benign.  pregnant.  barren.  going to live forever.  going to die in three days.  high i.q.  stupid as a stapler.   going to an ivy league school.  going to work at a drive-thru.  need medication.  need alcohol and social drugs.  positive. negative.  tumor.  doctor's fingerprint on the x-ray."  "you're driving me nuts!" i cried, throwing back my head.  "if you're not going to guess, then i'm going to have to tell you."  this was serious business, and javy was making a mockery of it.  i had been waiting for these test results since first taking the test back in the beginning of chapter two.  "the result was that i'm-"  javy stopped in his tracks.  "shut your talk hole.  i said i was going to guess, and i'm going to guess, okay?"  i jumped to my feet and shook my finger at him, so exasperated that i began to wish i had never agreed to becoming his legal guardian.  "well you know what?  guess away.  because i'm never going to tell you.  that's it.  i'm leaving."  "you're leaving?"  "yes, are you deaf?  now book me a flight and take me to the airport."  javy got out his credit card and sat down at his computer, sighing audibly.  "i wish you would you change your mind," he muttered as he logged on and paid for a one way ticket to lima, peru.  "but if you won't, i suppose i'll just have to pack your bags."  "fine.  you do that."  i began to cry, fat tears sliding down my face.  javy shot out his hands and let the tears drop into them so he could reconstruct smaller, skinnier tears.  "i am going to miss you," i said.  "yeah. and i still don't even know what the results were."  "i'll send you a postcard," i stated.  "or maybe in chapter eighteen, we'll make up and i won't even go."  "oh, you're going," javy quickly replied.  "that ticket wasn't cheap."

          last night, chris stuck this tree inside his jacket and that tinsel inside his pockets before proceeding to stumble, pressing against me in an effort to conceal our finds, past a big burly bouncer and into the night air.  we had found this booty inside a closet at a bar, and walking along outside, i scooped up this milk crate.  so now we have a little tree set up on a little milk crate, and now all we need to do is five finger discount a tree skirt.    good times.

       i'm one of those suckers working in retail america today.  worst. day. of. the. year. ever.  although last year i made a hundred bucks in commission.  so maybe it's not *that* bad.  i've felt kind of sad the past few days, but i can't put my finger on why.  maybe it's pms.  maybe it's because i no longer am taking my paxil (i.e., crazy pills), or maybe it's because nobody likes me and i can't do a thing with my hair.  it could be the weather; the shorter days don't do much for my seasonal affective disorder.  self-diagnosed seasonal affective disorder.  but i do know what will make me feel better.  instead of writing about it now, though, i'll write about it later- after it's already happened.  this shirt i'm wearing must have shrunk in the dryer.  either that or gnomes replaced it with a child's version; it's comically tight.

        the history of thanksgiving by jaclyn f.   thanksgiving is a national holiday that was started in 1963 by a young polish-mexican couple named agnes and miguel juarez.  1963 was a year full of turmoil and economic depression.  the demand for a more varied selection of "flesh" colored crayons far exceeded the actual supply of the one slightly salmon-tinted tan that was standardly supplied, and not everyone in america was able to afford more than 1 good set of flatware.  agnes and miguel had their own personal problems as well.  agnes had never lost the freshman fifteen from her college days and had actually gone on to gain a sophomore seventeen, a junior twenty, and an i-dropped-out-of-college-because-my-double-major-in-philosophy-and-refrigerator-repair-was-too-stressful-so-i-decided-to-become-a-waitress thirty.  she had difficulties combining the correct shampoo with its complimentary conditioner, and nightmares about smack-talking cheese bricks haunted even her waking hours.  miguel didn't have it so good, either.  his first novel had been rejected by all of the publishers due to the fact that it was copied pretty much word-for-word from "the adventures of tom sawyer."  he tried to argue that his book wasn't about tom sawyer; his character's name was tim sawyer, and instead of dating becky, tim really had it for a young boy named bucky.  so maybe it wasn't copied word-for-word- but even miguel, during weaker moments, would admit that it was pretty close.  1963 had agnes and miguel feeling especially low.  miguel could never find two socks that matched and would often have to wear one black one and one just-a-little-bit-off-black one.  "this isn't how a famous novelist is supposed to dress!" he'd growl, hitting agnes upside the head with whatever he could find, be it golf club, lamp, or the torn off bumper of a station wagon.  it was this abuse that almost drove agnes to leave miguel, but she was always reminded of upcoming events they had to attend together, such as the birth of their first daughter monkey anne.  they thought about what they could do to make things better.  miguel's idea was to organize a book exchange, to promote not only literacy but also to give miguel some fuel for his next novel, which was tentatively titled, "oliver twast."  agnes had a better idea.  "i'm hungry," she said.  "let's make a turkey."  "i can't afford a turkey," miguel roared, throwing a coffee cup at her.  "then we'll get somebody else to make the turkey, " agnes offered meekly.  "we'll tell them it's for a holiday and that everyone else is doing it, too.  my mom will make me a turkey if i tell her it's for a holiday.  she gets off on that kind of thing."  "yeah?"  miguel said.  "yeah,"  agnes smiled.  "what should we call this holiday?"  miguel lit up.  "we'll call it 'national why-not-consider-a-threesome day!'"  "i told you how i feel about that," agnes mumbled.  "and i told you how i feel about that, "miguel responded, grabbing his crotch.  "good.  really good.  but maybe your mother isn't that kind of lady anyway.  so let's just call it 'christmas.'"  "we came up with that last year in order to get that sofa set," agnes reminded him.  "and we did 'easter' the year before because you had it in your head that you wanted to sit on a rabbit's lap.  so let's just call this 'thanksgiving.'"  "what a dumb idea," miguel sighed.  "it's too many letters, and you know i can't spell all that well."  and that's what clinched it.  agnes told her mom about 'thanksgiving,' who immediately got excited and told her own friends and relatives about it.  nobody wanted to admit that they had't heard of it, so instead the grocery stores were jammed with a bunch of strangely confident, but secretly confused, housewives and mothers buying turkeys and cans of cranberry sauce.  and, yes, it was a good day for all, that thursday in 1963, except for old man williamson who had a stroke sometime around noon and linda farnsworth of denver, who lost a hand in a terrible blending accident.

        urlLink http://members.cox.net/impunity/endofworld.swf   so here i am, drinking a red bull for breakfast, over-cream-cheesing my bagel, and wondering where that strange smell is coming from.  i've just made a very important decision.  i am never going to discuss my feelings again.  i rarely do so in this blog, but my life is a different matter.  i'm like that girl in that story i once wrote, the one that ultimately got her mouth cut off for saying things like "i feel you feel that i feel i've lost that feeling...."   except i still have my mouth.  thank god, because that's where i keep my teeth.  no, but seriously folks.  it really is better to keep those small little worries inside you, because eventually they'll have to go away on their own.  or they'll build up and kill you, one of the two.  also, voicing those small worries inevitably gets you "the sigh" or "the groan."  you know how it goes.  you say, "hey, by the way, i was justing thinking about this," and the response is the "GROOOOAN!" or "SIGHHHHH!"  and both of these are loosely translated as "shut the fuck up, bitch, i'm sick of your whining."   of course, this just causes more small worries.  you think, "now i've done it.  i'd better say something about how i'm feeling about THAT."  it's like a regular paper mill inside of you, except instead of paper being produced, it's bicycle parts.  oh, wait, that's not right.  so that's my advice, for both myself and for you, dear reader.  just keep it inside, because it's obviously a stupid thought anyways!  and nobody wants to hear it!  why don't you make a witty observation about window treatments instead?  that'll have them rolling the aisles.  we saw the movie "elf" yesterday.  it was stupid, but it was great.  some parts had me exploding with laughter, and what a mess that was.  one more day until thanksgiving, which is one of my favorite holidays due to the good food and, you know, not having to buy anybody any goddamn gifts.

        1st post of day:   i had two interviews today.  actually, one interview- the one that chris' sister actually got for me, god bless the bergers and all they've given me- was canceled because it wasn't convenient for the man who was going to deliver it.  i see, i have to work around HIS schedule,  because HIS time is obviously more valuable than MINE.  he probably had to go have something waxed- i know how it is with these executive types and their hairy genitalia.  i just got back from the one interview that i did actually go on.  it was another group interview, and let me tell you that the only thing they could possibly be judging us on is the size of our tits, because everyone in these groups gives the same exact answers.  they asked three questions, and we went around the group and gave our answers.  blah, blah, blah, barf.  finally, the third question was "if you don't get this job, what's your plan b?"  by this point, i was sick and tired of this whole process, so while everyone else said, "i'm going to keep pursuing, etc, etc," i stood up, stated, "if i don't get this job, i'm moving to paris and becoming a sidewalk artist."  then i sat down.  the funny thing would be if they saw that answer as unique and creative and offered me the job on that answer alone.  the more reasonable thing would be if they saw me for the non-achieving asshole that i am, burned my resume, then did a seance to try to clear the building of my presence.  anyhow, i'm tired of all this bullshit.  somebody give me a job.  i'm smarter than everyone.  everyone.  i'm more creative than everyone.  everyone.  well, okay, not everyone.  but at least 25% ... of the lowest 25%.... fuck you.

        today i talk about kansas      this is the "wow" mobile of kansas, "wow" standing for "words on wheels."  what i think is funny about this van is that the driver probably thinks he's driving the "mom" mobile.     dr. crumbine of dodge city, kansas changed the face of public health as we now know it by stamping every fourth sidewalk brick with this "don't spit on sidewalk" slogan back in the early 1900s.  because of this visionary, there was a lot less saliva on the streets, and if you dropped your bagel dog, chances were pretty good that it would be okay to go ahead, pick it up, and stick it right into your mouth.  no germs to worry about there!!

       i really wanted that job, and this is why i didn't get it.  that and i went to the interview pantsless and with a parrot on my shoulder.  the interview was a "group" interview; it was me and twenty-nine other fucks taking turns introducing ourselves and saying why we want this job.  from this, the interviewers chose who got the job.  unbelievable.  i think i didn't get it because i talk fast when i'm nervous, and having to bear my soul in front of over two dozen idiots actually made me rather nervous.  all they probably heard was "blahblahblah blahblah and, um, like blahblahblah."  plus i was convinced i had food caught in my teeth, therefore making me not want to open my mouth too widely.  so my recruiter (yes, *my* recruiter) called me later and told me the awful news, then said, "well, i have another interview for you to go on.  i'll email you the details."  i checked my inbox when i get home; it's another fucking group interview.  i should probably just stay home that morning and watch the travel channel.  i think they're doing a feature on gary, indiana that i really don't want to miss.  gary, indiana:  the boarded-up window of america's midwest.  chris and i went to vic's karaoke thing last night.  we were sitting at a table with some of vic's wife's friends, and the one guy looked like he had his arm tucked in his shirt.  so, a little drunk, i joked, "what, are you armless or something?"  his reply was, "yeah, i left it in the car," which was funny, until i realized that he really didn't have an arm, and therefore my abrupt little comment had made me look extremely insensitive and rather rude.  i was mortified.  it's not like me to pick on amputees, it really isn't.  i wanted to buy him a drink, as an apology, but he already had a beer, and i knew that double fisting would not be an option.  oh man.  i shall await my punishments.

       yesterday i went to the gladhound lounge, where  urlLink my manager does his side gig as karaoke cowboy .  check out his website; it's hysterical, but not intentionally so.  then today i went to work.  and it too was also hysterical, but, like vic's website, not intentionally so.  i want out of my optical.  i'm too smart for this job.  i've just recently realized this.  i have the standardized testing scores to prove it.  i'm tired.  and these pretzels are making me thirsty.

       are amateur teenaged cheerleader nudes amateurs at being cheerleaders?  are they really bad cheerleaders?  worst human pyramid ever?    in other news, today i volunteered at the old folks' home.  it was awful, sad and awful.  the whole placed smelled like urine, and nobody seemed to understand who i was.  but they all wanted to talk to me.  "how are you?"  i asked one lady.  "i don't know," she responded.  "i have to go," i stated.  "no, you're going to stay," she said, and i think the  word "forever" was silently implied.  when i walked into the room, everybody waved.  "she's here for me!"  one lady yelled.  "no, she's here for me," screeched another.  it was depressing enough to make me want to cry, if only i weren't trying so hard not to gag on the aforementioned urine stench.  good lord.  i repeat, do not ever place me in a home.  just place me in a casket.  i'll be fine on my own.

       there's an ad on "the onion" for playboy.com, which declares, "see the women of wal-mart naked!"  this may titillate a few of you at first, but let's stop to think about this.  the women of wal-mart.  the women of wal-mart.  naked.  have any of you seen the women that work at wal-mart?  is 57 year old bertha from the fabric section- spread eagled on the customer service counter next to the coupon books- going to get you off?  if so, i guess i don't understand men at all.  my website's going to advertise, "see your optician naked!"  i'll be standing there, a little embarrassed, while i clean off your glasses donning only my birthday suit.  i don't know how the hell i'm going to keep my nametag on, though.  women of wal-mart.  my god.

       today i broke a $5,000 machine at work.  it was an innocent mistake, but i do think i may need a lawyer.  if they decide to deduct the money from my checks in order to make me pay for it, i'll have to look into other money-making options, such as selling unnecessary organs and maybe dressing up as a clown for my co-workers' childrens' birthday parties.  that wouldn't work.  "what is this balloon animal supposed to be?" they'd ask, waving a long, unbent balloon in my direction.  "it's a snake."  ah, that old joke never ceases to make me smile.  i wish it were mine.  on the topic of machines that don't work, my dvd player does not seem to play dvds.  which makes me wonder if it has decided not to be a dvd player anymore.  maybe now it plays tiny records or reheats small, perfectly circular pancakes.  maybe it's become a printer or a telephone.  if people make career changes in the middle of their lives, why wouldn't electronics?  i hope that machine at work manages to fix itself.  it prints out detailed reports on a person's visual field, and after breaking it, i tried to handwrite that detailed report myself.  i wrote, "everything looked fine," on a piece of paper, but the doctor did not seem impressed with my can-do attitude.

       a lot of people have been asking about the nature of my book.  well, not a lot of people- mostly just janice.  but i will pretend that she is a crowd of about 24 and now address said crowd, wearing my favorite turtleneck and clutching a martini.   "my book.  thanks for asking.  let me tell what you my book is about."  short pause, sip of martini, quick pat on my head to make sure i still have hair.  "my book.  it has yet to be written because right now i'm working on my short stories.  the short story that is demanding my attention now is a compellingly compelling tale of desperation, loneliness, kid-napping, diseases that affect the lymph nodes, and consumers that wish to consume more.  all this takes place on the high seas."  another short pause.  "no, yes, you're right, it doesn't take place on the high seas, but imagine the pirate-speak if it did!  argh, me mateys.  "my book, the one that is only in my head and continues to remain tangible only in the forms of single sentences saved on multiple floppy disks, smudged paragraphs scribbled out on cocktail napkins, and tiny doodles drawn in lipstick on the corner of my mirror (note to self, do not clean mirror).  this is a tale of two girls that both remind me a little of my former self and of a good friend of mine whose name i choose not to reveal.  okay, it's carole.  another character is a boy who does not actually exist, except in memories that have been artificially created.  the girls find different ways to embrace and reject each other's friendship, and a theme that runs throughout my story is one of "how to keep the world at an arm's length away" and another of "everyone will treat you the way you treat yourself."  so you'd better damn like yourself.  anyhow, i'd tell you more about the great plot devices i am going to employ, but i've already given away too much, so let me also warn would-be idea-stealers that i've already gone back in time to copyright this to myself, circa 1984.  so fuck off."  long gulp of martini.  "i would also like to mention that i am a performance artist.  mainly, when i'm not working on my many literary masterpieces (or thinking of working on them), i impersonate trees, shrubs, ferns- anything botanical.  i do this while banging my head against a drum.  everybody likes drumbeats, no?"

       last night, chris and i saw "jesus christ, superstar."  i never knew there was that much singing in biblical jerusalem.  or dancing.  overall, a good time was had by all.  i got the tickets for chris' birthday, which was about a week and a half ago.  after the show was over, though, he told me that he liked the movie better.  so i probably could have bought him the vhs and saved about fifty bucks.  ah, but i jest.  a night at the shubert theater?  we wouldn't pass that up even if somebody were offering us a lifetime supply of butter.  (we could use it; have you seen our butter bill?)

        urlLink straight plan for the gay man.   mark your calendar.  every 3rd wednesday of every month i am volunteering at a senior facility.  i use the term "volunteering" as loosely as i would use the phrase "yeah, i cleaned the bedroom."  it's not as much volunteering per se as it is being told to go there without pay.  it's not as much cleaning the bedroom as it is just pushing my junk off to a corner and maybe spraying a little garlic mist into the air as to break up the other unknown smells.  i will clean, adjust, and repair the glasses of the elderly.  i will say silent prayers in the bathroom that i will not one day end up in such a place, my own eyewear in complete disarray and being held together by chewed on toothpicks and bits of denture adhesive.  i will pray that the moth eaten cardigan sweater worn by agnes and the two-different-shades-of-black socks worn by henry will not one day be a mirror of my own outdated wardrobe.  my pills will not come in a dixie cup, dear lord.  i will not be alone in a temperature-controlled home playing bingo on tuesdays in order to earn an extra peach cobbler.  this is what they prayed, i'm sure, back when they were me.  oh how depressing we can allow it to be.  i've never volunteered for anything on my own.  in high school, we were forced to do 24 hours community service to graduate.  i worked at "rainbows," which was a catholic group for children of divorced parents.  they went here to cope, together, and to drink the kool-aid that i had poured and leave crumbs all over from the cookies i had dumped on the plastic serving platter.  see, that was my major role at "rainbows."  every once in a while, i escorted somebody to the potty.  now i have an obligation to volunteer once a month at this senior facility.  i sure hope that it is indeed just working on eyewear; i do not, repeat *do not*, want to escort henry or agnes to the potty.

        you leave me on a nightly basis, and in the morning i find you, no explanation attached.  i can figure out where you go; it's the opposite of where i go.  i do not try to chase you, because that would require running.  i just try not to talk about you to the visiting gnomes and only think about you as fondly as i might a vanilla dessert or a lost green t-shirt.  you're not allowed to keep doing this to me.  both halves must make one decision, otherwise i will decide for everyone, and it sure as hell won't be pretty.  or smart.  it won't even have an okay personality.  i don't even want to go to sleep.  there's an almanac i'm starting to read.  i know everything there is to know about the dominant religions of meeker, oklahoma and how much rain tallahassee got in the year 1973.  there was a girl that i hate, and she was happy to see me.  she wanted to hang out all the time; she was wearing horrible pants and wanted to go shopping for obscure font sizes.  times old roman, 7.92.  she had questions about you that i dodged as if she were tossing week-old fish.  after a while, i turned the tables, and started asking her questions about the overly read, corduroy-hat-wearer in her life- even though by this point i had already slept with him.  i will never go rollerskating again.  this is a promise.

       sure, i want kids.  everybody wants kids.  who doesn't want kids?  yesterday, i realized i didn't want kids.  kids, with the touching, the breaking, the begging, the pooping.  kids with the drooling, the hair-pulling, the staring, the burping.  kids who can't reach anything on high shelves and need you to pour their cereal and show them what you can flush and what you DEFINITELY CANNOT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DO YOU HEAR ME flush.  kids who want to know where babies come from ("see, when a man sticks his penis inside a woman's vagina...") and what god looks like ("i don't know- bob denver?")  and how big texas is ("about the size of your toy box.  can't you see how busy i am?").  kids.  little pre-people depending on YOU for everything.  i hope they're not depending on me to teach them cursive.  because i'm still not so good at that.  anyhow, i had this image that one day i would have kids- adorable kids with big brown eyes and wavy brown hair.  i pictured that my daughter would wear a velvet dress everywhere, and in my visions, she's always sitting in a big chair, quietly coloring.  in this image, she's managed to make herself dinner and also vacuum the hallway.  i have a son who wears a propellor hat all the time and also sits in a big chair, playing video games with the sound turned off and putting himself to bed by about five p.m.  this boy has also mowed the lawn and reshingled the roof.  my kids, in my head, are well-behaved and quiet.  they don't require my direction.  they already know the answers to their questions.  any waste that comes out of their bodies smells like a glade plug-in and is cleaned up before i even know about it.  in my realization yesterday, i saw that this would not be a likely scenario.  in real life, my kids would spill and scream and demand things from me that i cannot give them- such as a vast knowledge on the topic of world politics.  i have no knowledge of world politics.  i also can't teach either of them to play the tuba.  i'd be a worthless mother.  i'd lose my temper.  i'd feed them at irregular intervals.  i'd smother them or not talk to them enough.  i wouldn't deal well with- hey, is this entry about how children are evil or i am evil?  suddenly i can't remember.

       the book i'm reading now is  urlLink "the time traveler's wife."   it's by a woman who teaches at columbia college, where i went.  as far as teachers who have published good books, columbia's got a lot of them, such as  urlLink this guy , who wrote a really cool book called "american skin."  now, the teacher i had for fiction will never publish anything.  she was too nice to be a writer, and the only outstanding detail i can remember about her is that she had some problem with her cornea that impaired her vision and forced her to wear thick, unsightly glasses.  this sucks, because it is my goal to learn under some great published writer.  my other teachers were nothing to write home about, either.  one guy spearheaded a potato campaign and another guy worked under the deceased chicago mayor harold washington.  he had a lot of stories.  "one time, harold washington and i got so drunk and decided to pick up some high school girls..."  another teacher handled the p.r. for some infamous plane crashes.  he too had a lot of stories.  "one time, when that plane crashed, i took a break from talking to the media to go find harold washington so we could pick up some high school girls...."  i was never taught by anyone great.  which is a shame, since knowing popular literary icons is one of my hobbies.  that and collecting strange smells in bottles.

       my new november's resolutions:  stop being bothered about the small things, and say "fuck it" about the bigger things, a la my mentor carole.  be on a reality series and ruin it for everyone.  try my hardest to look my hottest.  stop laughing.  finish my short stories, start my novel.  again, stop laughing.  learn to cook, but do it in secret so that it'll be a surprise for everyone.    delete that last one so it really will be a surprise.  speaking of which, i forgot that i put some wontons in the oven over fifteen minutes ago.  the directions said "9-10."  check wontons.  publish pictures of myself on every porn site available.  have good laugh at hilarity that will inevitably pursue  buy house and paint every room a different color.  allow no two walls to match.  collect ugly antiques.  install bowling lane.  seriously look into going back to school.  seriously check financial options.  seriously try to read things instead of employing the old "skim and scan."  pass tests not through logical elimation but extreme intelligence.  kick serious ass at karaoke; be approached by talent agent and promptly flown to new york.  win lotto, buy a lot of green beans.  say loudly, and out of nowhere, "i know you want me, but you cannot have me" to complete strangers, in church, while trying my hardest to look my hottest.  get root canal.  try to buy a jury's vote in a case that i don't care about.  wonder about loss of innocence.  ponder about lack of soda.

       whose idea was it to catapult carrots into fiona apple's face?  not mine, but i participated eagerly and even accompanied one of the carrots with a nasty letter.  i signed the letter with my own name and later when she asked if i had written it, i said, "no, that's not my name."  i walked to the library and called chris for a ride home.  he said, "you walked there, now walk back."  so i did, but we were living in a houseboat afloat in the sea and i couldn't find another boat to get me there.  i did, however, attain a library card.  my sister was making pastries in the river.  the river was filthy, but the pastries looked good.  we put them in our purses and ate them in the shoe store.  the shoe store had three glorious levels.  my mother became a cashier at wal-mart and my dad dumped her.  because she used to be a famous actress.  in tahiti.

       a fly's eye has over 4,000 lenses.  i would imagine that making glasses for *that* creature would take well over an hour.  and a contact fitting?  good lord.  lately, all i can think about is wanting to go back to school.  not even in pursuit of my master's degree, but just to take some classes.  it's odd; i'm not exactly what you would call a model student.  when i am in a class, i tend to spend my time daydreaming, doodling, and mentally constructing outfits that i would like to own.  during the five minute breaks, i sneak off to go home, and if for some odd reason i don't leave, i usually try to position myself behind a pole so that i can fall asleep without immediately being noticed.  and yet i really want to go to school.  it's not going to happen, because that would require money, time, and an ambition i don't possess.  but it's a nice thought.  in the meantime, i will continue to educate myself.  assuming that all the offspring survived, 190,000,000,000,000,000,000 flies could be produced in four months by the offspring of a single pair of flies.  and if all those flies had poor visual acuity?  damn.  p.s.  if anybody knows why i'm recieving  sports illustrated  in the mail- IT'S NOT FUCKING FUNNY.  UNSUBSCRIBE ME IMMEDIATELY.

       i downloaded  urlLink this game , mainly because chris told me to.  and i played it, and now i've made an ass out of myself.  i'm not good at fighting games, even when the characters are so damn cute.  why can't we all just put our weapons aside and sit down for a good game of trivial pursuit?  with this attitude in my head, i will never win any wars.  i'm glad they don't draft females.  "private jackie, you've blown up your own platoon.  again."  "gosh, i'm sorry.  hey, where can i plug in my blowdryer?"

       in my dream, i was in an anatomy class.  it wasn't like my real anatomy class in high school, which i still have very fond memories of.  in my real anatomy class, dan and i dressed up the mink we were supposed to be dissecting.  we put a cowboy hat on its head, boots on its feet, and rammed a candy cane into it jaw as to make our mink "festive."  i believe there was also a pillow that we put under its head, so that it would be comfortable as we sliced open its muscles.  the best thing about our mink was that we were able to stick a scalpel up its ass and create a mink puppet that walked around and quipped humorous sentences such as "rectum?  it nearly killed him!"  i don't know if we ever actually made the mink say that.  it would have been hard to convince anyone that the mink was speaking, what with aforementioned candy cane in its mouth.  but, you know.  anyhow, in this dream, my project was to create a collage of the human body with magazine clippings.  i made a kidney out of a photograph of a shoe.  a heart out of a picture of an apple.  a cranium out of a dollhouse.  and when i woke up, my first instinct was to get my collage out and hang it on the fridge.  but, alas, it didn't really exist.  at least it doesn't exist yet.  i need to buy glue and find my scissors.  i ended up going to the museum of sci & industry with chris yesterday.  my favorite part of the museum is the mold-a-rama machines.  too bad the mold-a-rama sculptures stink so much.  i want a mold-a-rama in the shape of a dinosaur getting conked in the head by another dinosaur holding a beer bottle.  not a mold-a-rama in the shape of a goddamn train.  what am i going to do with a train?  stupid wax train.

       today i'm going to the  urlLink baha'i  temple in wilmette.  starting my own religion didn't work out, so i'm going to latch onto this one.  "the earth is but one country and mankind its citizens."  haven't i always said that myself?  i'm not trying to say that catholicism has failed me, mainly because i know a lot of money was spent on my confirmation and communion parties, but let's just say that catholicism has failed me.  there's just too many rules that i don't understand.  you can't eat meat here.  you can't have sex there.  you can't worship false gods here.  you can't commit murder there.  plus, have you ever tried to read the bible?  while there are quite a few stories of adultery and intrigue, most of it is a family tree.  and have you ever tried to read a family tree?  it's tiring.  my dad always said, "never trust anyone who's overly religious."  then again, this is also the man that said, "what do you mean i can't wear black knee socks with shorts?"  who can you believe?  i mean, really.

       my dreams were of people in costumes fighting over whether or not to kill the person dressed as a bull because they were all convinced she had spiked the punch with raid.  and yet, oddly enough, they all continued to drink this punch while arguing over their options.  today i got an email from a guy that i went out on ONE date with an entire year ago.  he just wanted to see how i was doing.... obviously, he can't get me out of his mind.  obviously he's still hoping that i'll have his first born son and dance with him at our 25th wedding anniversary.  obviously.  yes, i'll gag you.  my other dreams involved my three year old daughter, my handsome husband, and the mob.  my handsome husband and i had moved to houston because the mob was threatening to steal our three year old daughter.  of course the mob found us because that's how the mob is- always finding people.  and my handsome husband and i had to run with our three year old daughter through a game show set to try and get away from the mob, who brandished not guns but breadsticks.  i'd like to go to a concert.  it's been a while.  who wants to go?

       somewhere in an alternate universe, there's a jackie that didn't take a hangover pill with her first drink.  that alternate jackie- bizarro jackie, if you will- probably has her head stuck in an alternate toilet.  not this jackie, though.  because i did take that pill, i'm only *thinking* about putting my head in the toilet.  but, as you can see, i'm not actually doing it.  i wonder what the other alternate jackies are doing.  popular science, and the tv show "sliders," will tell you that there's an infinite number of parallel universes.  surely, i'm in a good percentage of them.  but what am i doing in them?  where do i live, who am i with, how much money do i make?  what's my favorite sandwich?  what shoes did i wear last thursday?  am i leading any communist regimes?  am i an olympic ice skater?  what are all of my favorite colors?  nobody says brown is their favorite color.  somebody so wisely observed this.  i think i'm going to be the exception from now on; my favorite color is brown.  those are the m&m's that i'm eating first.  fuck you and your reds and blues.  i can't believe it's 2:30 already.  to think i almost had to work today.

       i'd like to speak in nothing but song lyrics.  the only thing is, it would take me three hours to construct a paragraph out of song lyrics.  and if somebody asked for directions to my cousin's house, i'd have a hard time finding a song that mentioned interstate 294.  today is halloween for us.  i have yet to put on my costume, and i think i may try to put it off for as long as possible.  maybe i'll put it on in the morning after everyone's left.  i'm a trampire, which is like a vampire, only trampier.  like, i'm not only going to suck your blood but also your....  oh god.  the ghosts from my catholic upbringing are planning to push me into a canyon, i can tell.

       it didn't feel like christmas.  then again, it hasn't felt like christmas for several years now.  it's just felt like an extended weekend that i'm forced to spend with family, because the mall is closed.  sometimes i unbutton my pants too soon.  specific incidents i'm thinking about involve using public washrooms, where i'm still a good twenty feet from the door, in the middle of the restaurant, and my pants are already undone.  this happens mostly when i've had a little to drink.  of course, i exaggerate; it's more like five feet away.  and i usually only undo one or two buttons, or unzip just halfway, but i always catch myself and think, "good lord.  what if the mayor is watching again?"  tomorrow we leave for virginia.  this is all i see fit to write for now.

       i am torn between hating my mother and finding some way to love her out of pity.  i think my sister is the most beautiful, and funniest, girl in the entire world.  my dad is wonderful.  i wonder why he's still married to my mother, unless he justifies it with the aforementioned "pity" factor.  i hope no one ever loves me out of pity.  i hope my sister finds some way to move out, and away from mother, very soon.  i used to be jealous of my sister, because she was my mother's favorite.  so, at some young point in my life, my mother was obviously pretty important.  strange.  i'm trying to pinpoint how old i was when i realized that my mother was severely wacked out.  seven?  eight?  i know i was always my dad's favorite when we were little.  it was because i was so damn smart.  also, i was the first born.  my dad used to give my mother an "allowance."  i hope nobody ever gives me an "allowance."  i wouldn't mind, however, giving my husband an "allowance."  it's fun to be in control and make somebody beg you for an extra buck so they can supersize.  i kid.  i think.  i'm afraid of having children for many reasons.  one, the fact i have tiny hips and would probably be cracked in half if i had to push something out of me.  two, vericose veins.  three, being awakened in the night by a lot of crying.  four, having to buy toys and food and immunizations and little socks and no-more-tears shampoo.  but, most importantly, i'm afraid that i will turn into my mother, that my children will hate me, that i will not know how to properly love them and be exactly what they need.  people said i looked like my mother.  i never saw it.  i know i don't look like my dad, which, god bless him, is a good thing, but who the hell *do* i look like?  anne frank, a little bit, but i don't think we have any relation to her.  thinking about my parents makes me want to cry.  i don't know why.  or do i?  because i do pity my mother, because i don't think it's her fault that she's so fucking crazy, and because thinking about my dad, all he's done for me and my sister, all he's sacrificed- and how little i've done to show my appreciation- makes my heart hurt like it's being crushed by giant, all-knowing hands.

       (pretend you see a picture of a map of north america, no labels, with a giant red star covering half of virginia)  i found this helpful map on how to get to norfolk, virginia.  we just head down, and then make a left.  we've rented a car for our trip.  the car we reserved is a "grand am or similiar."  the similiar part bothers me.  bikes are similiar to cars in that they have wheels.  a blender is similiar to a car in that it has a motor.  an apple is similiar to a grand am in that they both come in red.  so we'll see what we actually get when we go on saturday to pick up the car.  i'm glad chris and i feel the same about this trip.  it may suck.  norfolk may be boring as fuck.  but we don't care.  we'll be happy to drive fourteen hours and just glimpse the ocean, drink, and, you know, buy me some t-shirts.  remind me to print out my map before we go.

       according to  urlLink this article , saddam could be a spokesman for dove moisturizing shampoo and palmolive soap.   "even if you're hanging out in a spider hole, that's no excuse for your hair not to be soft and luxurious and your hands nice and smooth."  these two companies should jump on this opportunity.  he also had lipton tea.  i wonder if the lipton people know this.  then there's  urlLink this link  that sells the osama and hussein messenger bag, the saddam baby bib, and the "we got him" thong.  the "we got him" thong.  if there's one reference to somebody i don't want near my hooch, it would probably be a reference to saddam.  also louie anderson.

       about 7 months ago, i wept because i was leaving behind my lenscrafters in the southern suburbs.  i transferred up to a new store and proceeded to tell everyone how much i hated it because "everyone's so old," and "no one's any fun."  today's my last day at this 2nd lenscrafters.  yesterday, on my 2nd to last day, i could feel my eyes watering as i said good-bye to a few people.  today, ladies and gentlemen, it may be all-out tears.  everything can grow on you; love one lenscrafters, and you're bound to love another, eventually.  your heart WILL go on!  sniff, sniff.  when will this circle crack?

       i swear, those wacky catholics have a patron saint for everything.  just a sampling of the extensive list:  patron saint of hairstylists ... of advertising ... of unattractive people  ... of zoos ... of button makers ... of dysentery ... of goiters (!) ... of football ... of girls from rural areas ... of kidney stones ... of loss of milk by nursing mothers ... of newspaper editorial workers ... of being against oversleeping ... of hardware stores.  it goes on and on.  peruse it  urlLink here  for yourself.  and now, you lapsed catholic you, you'll never have the excuse of, "well, i didn't know who the patron saint of waiters is, therefore i couldn't pray."

       now, i've always found goiters to be rather humorous.   urlLink until i saw this .  chris and i are tentatively planning a trip to norfolk, virginia, our tentative future home.  i think i'm probably joking about the tentative future home thing, but you never know.  i'm relatively sure i don't want to live in illinois forever, but i guess i'd be open to other locales besides virginia.  i hear  urlLink vancouver, b.c.,  is lovely this time of year.  i went online to see what major art museums norfolk boasts, because you can't travel without seeing some art.  and i felt dismay when i saw that their chrysler museum of art has stuff by mark rothko.  i hate that guy.     this is bullshit, this painting.  all of his paintings are bullshit.  where are the despondent ballerinas and melted clocks?  this is just color-  shitty color.  harrumph.  but, despite this disappointment, i still want to go.  there's a t-shirt waiting for me:  "somebody in norfolk virginia loves me."  but it isn't mark rothko.

        for girls (and some boys) that are struggling with the "to swallow or not to swallow"  urlLink conundrum :    Recently studies have shown that regular consumption of semen can actually have some wonderful health benefits. Semen contains at least 13 prostaglandins and high concentrations of hormones that retain potency if taken orally. The quality of the seminal hormones is thought to be superior to even prescription versions. In the study women who regularly consumed their lovers sperm showed such benefits as a reduction in ovarian cancers, lowered depression and many even had acne symptoms lessen or stop entirely. It is thought that the oral consumption of the potent hormones had a balancing effect on woman's hormonal ups and downs.   lowered depression, eh?  turns out paxil was never the solution- just a vigorous blow job to yield large quantities of jizz.  well, enough of that.  i never thought i'd use the word "jizz" in a blog entry.  just goes to show- you can never know exactly what to expect.  p.s. now liz phair's song, "h.w.c." is making sense:   Give it to me, don't give it away Don't think about what the others say My skins getting clear, my hairs so bright All you do is fuck me every day and night  You're my secret beauty routine Na, na, na, na, what my body has seen I am lookin' good and I'm feeling nice Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum...   okay.  really.  i'm done.

       according to the 18th century theory of preformation (which, yes, has since been discredited), an individual develops by simple enlargement of a tiny fully formed organism that exists in the germ cell.  to put it in layman's terms and not plagiarize quite as much, every person from me to you to kobe bryant existed exactly as we are now when we were only specks of our daddy's sperm or our mama's egg.  the great epic "look who's talking" is a cinematic example of this theory, only imagine baby mikey's voice echoing from even inside his great-grandfather's sperm, or even his great-great-great-great-great grandaunt's ear wax.  sound crazy?  well, that's probaby why it's been discredited.  let's say we discredited the discreditors.  we did some detective work and discovered that their grand discrediting methods had involved a haphazard set-up of test tubes containing only yellow mustard and a spinner from the game "twister."  no matter how you try to utilize these materials, nothing all that scientific will emerge from your dealings.  just ask the judges of my fourth grade science fair.  i like this thoery because it means i was floating in a cell in the year of 1567, as the same jackie i am now, getting to watch the world unfold before my very eyes.  okay, not my literal eyes, but the eyes of my all-knowing, germ-sized soul.  yes, because of preformation, i have witnessed great world events, sat with my grandparents during their "wooing" period, and maybe even partially voted for kennedy.  it's staggering to think of where i was and what i was involved in.  possibly, i could have eaten babaganoush with cleopatra.  most importantly, i'd like to think that i was a microscopic spectator of the filming of "dr. strangelove."  i always wonder what colors i'm missing out on it while viewing it in nondescript black and white.

(endnote: i thought i would feel really weird about eating thumper, but then i got over it by humming "the circle of life" in my head and reminding myself that, yes, the strong eat the weak.  and i am strong.  and i think i really like the taste of bunny.)

       i barely slept last night.  i had stuff on my mind.  it occurred to me that- sure, while i did get the one job- the other job for which i took the personality test never called me back.  which means i failed...  the personality test.  this makes me feel sad.  i want to know what exactly went wrong with this test.  did i reveal my criminal mastermind?  did i reveal that i'm overly emotional, unconfident, and kind of sniffly?  or were the results akin to the e.q. test i took last year- and horribly low?  apparently i'm very cold-hearted and don't know how to empathize.  but you would think that would be a desirable trait in the business world.  bah.  i shouldn't fret about it too much.  but if there's something so horribly wrong w/ me that i'm failing your basic personality tests- then i want to know.

       the world's largest prime number was discovered by michael shafer.  it has 6,320,430 digits and would take up over 1400 pages to write out.  if a larger font size were to be used, such as helvectica 26.7, it might take up over 200,000 pages.  this is just a rough estimate based on some of my own mental calculations.  please don't quote me in your thesis.  i'm kind of mad at michael shafer.  i too was working on this project, and i was this close to finding the number myself.  when i say "this close," imagine me holding my finger and thumb about half an inch apart, and squinting my eyes.  anyway, i got as far as 127.  then i stopped to heat up a pizza.  that's when michael probably swooped in and beat me to the punch.  in other news, peter barham, of bristol university, has also outdone me in the field of figuring out the formula for cooking the perfect turkey.  his own mathematical equation accounts for the ratio of the specific heat of the turkey to the specific heat of the air, and the radius, girth and precise physical geometry of the turkey.  while i was using different methods, such as trying to factor in the "soupiness" of the gravy and the brand of aluminum foil that one would use to cover his/her turkey, i was on the exact same track.  but then i took some time out to pluck my eyebrows.  alas, peter barham gets the credit, and i get jack.  the thing that i wonder about is this.  what the hell is a guy as smart as peter barham doing working with turkeys?  you'd think he'd be out there trying to cure cancer or aids or find a way to invent a bottomless glass of wine.  but, no.  he's cooking a bird.  today i sat down and said, "i'm going to finish my story."  i'm estimating i have about 6 paragraphs left.  6 lousy paragraphs.  i've been sitting here for hours, and i haven't even opened the word file yet.  there is something extremely wrong with me.  now i think i'll do a google search for insanely difficult miniature golf courses.  for research for my own mini golf course that i plan on opening, spring 2005.

       i found this in the sacramento bee:   The Victoria's Secret "Very Sexy Fantasy Bra" by jeweler Mouawad is priced at $11 million. Sounds pretty expensive, but it includes matching panties, more than 6,000 white diamonds, sapphires and other precious stones, and a 70-carat pear-shaped stone hanging from the center of the bra.   good fucking lord.  i know why they call it a fantasy bra- only in your fantasies could you possibly own it.  i don't think even jennifer lopez has spent this much on a bra.  even one that comes with matching panties.

        urlLink this is a lot of fun.   anyhow, in 1941, no author won the pulitzer prize for a novel.  so, i'm proposing that i take it.  everybody's competing for the 2004 one, because that one will clearly be the most recent, but who else besides me is willing to accept one that's outdated by over 60 years?  who?  stand up, and let's fight over it.  of course, i'd have a better argument if i actually  had  a novel- but some of my grocery lists are so well-written that they read like prose.  beautiful prose.  nobody describes a half pound of ground beef and a 20 pack of tampons quite like me.

        urlLink my christmas wish, every year.   thanks to my good friend carole for sending me said link.  carole and i are part of the "we're flat as hell, but still hot as hell" club.  however, we'd still like some boobs.  today i am contemplating a hair cut.  i have to summon up all of my courage to do this; while i know i need one, i also know that there are a lot of drawbacks to doing the deed.    1, my haircuts have become increasingly expensive.  i find i can only go to the uppity salon type places, which is terribly ironic considering i used to have my FATHER cut my hair.  dad would just grab my hair into a clump and, with a pair of kitchen shears, make one mighty WHACK!  and there was my new hair cut.  good enough for me; i was fourteen and knew that even a stylish hair cut wouldn't get me a boyfriend, as i just oozed of dorkiness and ill-fitting jeans.  so why bother?  2, i've hair hair stylists say some nasty things to me.  let's cite 1999, when "shandra" said, "boy, it's awfully tangled back here," followed by, "do you condition at all?"  it was all i could do not to gouge shandra's eyes out.  i wanted to say, "boy, shandra, you're awfully fat.  do you exercise at all?"  yet the fact that she was looming over me with sharp tools made me quickly reconsider.  3, if i get a haircut, it's going back to chin length.  and if it's going back to chin length, my security-blanket ponytail is gone.  which means i have to spend at least 3 minutes a day styling it.  going from 3 seconds to 3 minutes is a big jump.  and i'm a busy girl, what with all those telethons i'm organizing.  4, ,,,  aw, fuck it, i'm just going to go get it over with.  when i get my hair cut in the fashion that i'm planning to, i always hope a couple of people will say i resemble amelie.  because amelie's pretty cute.  yeah.

       my mom is tall and thin.  for this, i am grateful, because my dad is short and stocky.  i inherited the tall and thin side of my mother's genes.  most of the time, i hope that's all i inherited from her- but whenever i feel like being mean to a child, i fear that i've inherited more.  my dad has wavy hair.  my mom has straight hair.  i have very curly hair.  i guess i inherited this curly hair from my dad- but sometimes it doesn't make sense.  let's get mendalian for a moment.  straight hair is ss.  wavy hair is Ss.  curly hair is SS.  i'm SS with a ss parent and a Ss parent.  where'd i get that other S from?  my sister's hair is as straight as a... straight... piece... of something.  good for her.  my dad is 100% italian.  my mom is 50% polish, 25% hungarian, and 25% chinese.  that makes me 50% italian, 25% polish, 1/8 hungarian, and 1/8 chinese.  chris often refers to me as his asian girlfriend.  he never refers to me as his italian girlfriend.  well, maybe a few times to his family.  i don't know what my blood type is.  i just tell people, "red."  after it hits oxygen, of course.  before i bleed, my type is "blue."  blue negative.

        urlLink dude, she kidnapped herself.   i think i have arthritis.  i'm not saying "i think i have arthritis" like i would maybe say, "i think i have a chance at getting a grammy this year" or "i think i invented the microwave."  this is too serious of a matter to joke about.  really, i think i have arthritis.  these are the symptoms that i found on yahoo! health.   Symptoms   gradual and subtle onset of deep aching joint pain  worse after exercise or weight bearing  often relieved by rest  joint swelling  limited movement  morning stiffness  grating of the joint with motion  joint pain in rainy weather  Note: There may be no symptoms.   while that last part about there maybe not being any symptoms kind of throws me for a loop, i am currently experiencing stiffness, deep aching pain, and limited movement in the joints of my fingers.  it only makes sense that i would get arthritis, what with over 5 years of adjusting frames added to occasional, yet vigorous, video game play, daily bouts of typing, and the difficulty i experience when trying to twist off the caps of non twist off beer bottles.  my hands hurt!  and my hands are my livelihood.  why couldn't the bastards have gone after my ear lobes?  anyhow, this is a depiction of what my hands will look like in, oh, let's say 2-3 weeks.     but i read that therapy may help with arthritis.  this doesn't sound like a bad idea; my inner child has been meaning to make an appointment anyways, as to dig up those filthy repressions.  oh, that kind of therapy.  drat.

       i found this survey thing on  urlLink holly's livejournal  and thought that i would take it myself.  i love this shit.   THREE THINGS THAT SCARE ME 01 - that cross-eyed guy who takes the bus and repeatedly touches his crotch. 02 - pickle relish.  can't go near the stuff without getting the willies. 03 -  three different doctors have diagnosed me with aulophobia- fear of flutes.  THREE THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND 01 -  why my homemade robot doesn't work. 02 -  french.  it's a bitch trying to watch " urlLink Le Fabuleux destin d'Amlie Poulain " without subtitles. 03 -  i'm not entirely clear on where ear wax comes from.   THREE THINGS I'D LIKE TO LEARN 01 -  how to type with my toes.  when i write my novel, i want the jacket to say, "the author wrote this story using only her feet."  yeah, that would be rad. 02 -  the national anthem of botswana, just for kicks. 03 -  the appeal of fantasy football.  THREE THINGS I AM WEARING RIGHT NOW 01 -  turkish nipple armor. 02 -  bubble wrap underwear (pop pop POP!). 03 -  a wire.  i've always wanted to say that.  THREE THINGS ON MY DESK 01 - half finished letter to juan valdez.  i was wondering if i could borrow the mule for a few days. 02 - a 40 lb chocolate cupcake.  i'd eat it, but i think i hear something moving inside of it.   03 - my own "olympic" torch, because the olympic people have been pretty resistent about letting me carry the real one.  something about my history of dropping things.  THREE THINGS I WANT TO DO BEFORE I DIE 01 - wear a sea-shell bra to the mall and wait for a sea captain to offer to buy me lunch. 02 - hand out leaflets about the gospel.  while wearing a sea-shell bra. 03 - at least one pull up.  THREE WAYS TO DESCRIBE MY PERSONALITY 01 -  some ways you could describe my personality woud be with a very nicely worded letter or 02 -  finger puppets or 03 -  you could even describe my personality with some sort of pyrotechnic show.  i guess it's up to you, really.  who am i to tell you what to do?  THREE BAD THINGS ABOUT MY PERSONALITY 01 -  i tend to have tiny problems with being slightly homicidal. 02 -  the voices inside my brain often prompt me to steal dogs from the pet store- and then take them to the pound. 03 -  sometimes, i'm just TOO great.  THREE THINGS I LIKE ABOUT MY BODY 01 -  i'm glad my knees bend in the direction that they do.  otherwise walking would be difficult. 02 -  my boobs are huge.  gigantic.  i tend to knock small children over while jogging around the candy store, oftentimes sending them straight into a coma.  but, it's a blissful coma, because my heaving, beautiful bosom was the last thing that they remember seeing. 03 - the human nose was a good idea.  kudos to whoever came up with that little gem.  THREE THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT MY BODY 01 -  no gills.  why no gills? 02 -  i should never have gotten that nixon tattoo.  i'm tired of answering questions about it. 03 -  no part of it is bionic.  sigh.  THREE THINGS MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU 01 -  i own and operate a small printing press devoted to stories about bipolar midgets.  our last publication was "betsy... the bipolar midget."  the one before that was "ronald... the bipolar midget." 02 -  i own three storage garages worth of "i love lucy" memorabilia.  among them, i have the actual preserved body of ethel mertz.   03 -  i'm wanted in 34 states.  by 208 different guys.  THREE PEOPLE YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW BETTER 01 - franklin roosevelt.  but i guess it's too late. 02 - andrew lloyd weber and 03 - tim rice.  i really want them to write a musical about me called,  "jackie!  christ, what a superstar!"   THREE THINGS I SAY THE MOST 01 -  "we really should do something about all that third world debt." 02 -  "touch my butt!" 03 -  "all right, who's the wise guy who replaced all my heart medicine with... hey, what is this anyways, a crushed up urinal cake? "  THREE PLACES YOU WANT TO GO 01 -  i need to find a really good outlet mall.  i can't even tell you how many times i've taken pilgrimages to so-called "outlet" malls only to end up bitterly paying department store prices for some pea green sweater that later turns out to be horribly irregular. 02 -   urlLink world's tallest western boot , in edmonton alberta, so i can stand there and say, "wow.  that's big boot."   03 -  i'd like to put my flag on mars.  not the united states' flag- but jackietown's flag.  THREE NAMES THAT YOU GO BY 01 -  douche bag jones 02 -  fatty fat fat 03 -  jackie "this is the ninth paper cut this week" f.

       this interview this morning... sigh.  i hate those questions that they ask, such as  "do you like working independently or in a team?"  well, if you say "independently," that means you hate people and can't work with others.  if you say, "in a team," that means you can't do anything by yourself.  there's no right answer.  "please tell me about a time you exhibited leadership qualities."  well, shit.  next time i'm saying i organized the american revolution.  or, next time, i'm telling them that the heaven's gate cult was my idea.  i still can't believe that my spaceship never came, but as for my leadership skills?  fan-fucking-tastic.  "what's your greatest accomplishment?"  i wanted to say, "finding this address, considering there's a gigantic tree in front of your sign."  but i also said that i was good at problem solving, which i think might include locating local addresses.  can't be too sure, though.  i feel like hitting myself over the head with the next brick i can find.  or the next pillow.  yeah, i think i'd rather use the pillow.  can't get blood in my hair before having to go to work- i don't need any more questions that i can't answer.  "please tell me why there's blood in your hair."  "well, sir, as a born leader... yeah, i don't know where i'm trying to take this."  anyhow, driving to this morning's interview, i passed a sign for a restaurant that advertised, "pancakes and cocktails."  what a great idea!  "i'll have a crepe and a bloody mary, please."  why isn't this a more widespread combo?  did you know that the united states is number 7 on the human development's index of most livable countries?  there are six other places that are more livable than here- including iceland.   i can't believe the quality of life can be so much better in a place so much colder.  i wonder if they have pancakes and cocktails- together at last!- in iceland.

       they said there was going to be snow.  where's the snow?  not that i'm complaining.  me and snow, we don't get along.  we agree to disagree.  it's early.  every time i try making coffee these days, the filter folds over and i get grounds in my drink.  it's pissing me off, almost to the point of writing an angry letter to somebody... if only i could figure out who.  i got nothing.  wish me luck for this morning's job interview.  even if you don't mean it.

       what if you did a google search for my name and came up with this link?  what if i knew you years ago; what would i want you to know about me now?  finding ghosts from the past is so easy with the internet.  i've rather made it a hobby; it's a bit like being a detective.  or a stalker, one of the two.  but what if somebody found me here?  i wonder how i come across; is it "same old jackie," or "i can't believe that's jackie!"  probably neither.  mostly because i can't imagine who would want to search for me.  but if you had searched for me, let me just tell you- life is pretty good now that i don't see you anymore.

MINUS NINETEEN!! but, you know what?  i'm not willing to accept the (positive) single digits or teens either.  i won't settle for anything less than 30 degrees, because i'm tired of THIS BULLSHIT.  do you hear me?  i won't stand for it any longer! something drastic is coming, you'll see. fuck this weather. fuck it right in the... weatherhole.

        east chicago man shot dead cigarette   that's the google search i just completed, in search of the name of a man who was killed over a cigarette.  last night, i was told that my friend jeremie's "best friend" had been killed over a cigarette this past month.  i thought it was his friend juan, who i had hung out with on several occasions as well.  not that i was such good friends with this guy juan, but my heart lurched to think that he may be dead- especially because i know how much it would have hurt jeremie to lose him.  alas, it wasn't him.  i found the news articles (isn't the internet fantastic?), and was relieved to see that it was some other guy that had been shot.  then i had to chastise myself.  "why is it okay that this other dude is dead instead of juan?  a human life is a human life!"  sound, christian logic, but i didn't buy it.  human lives we know are more important than human lives we don't, yes?  that's why it's always okay to kill those in iraq.  right?  right?  sigh.  that reminds me that i need to attend an anti-war rally sometime soon.  because anti-war rallies ALWAYS get things done.  i know of at least 35 wars that were haulted due to a bunch of people blocking traffic.  you don't know which wars i'm talking about?  that's because  they were haulted .  this blog entry would have been more topical a year ago, but i'm always a little behind.  that's why my jeans fit so well.

        moldy oldies   i'm eating expired cottage cheese.  it's not expired by much, but it is expired nonetheless.  the cottage cheese itself won't make me sick; if i keep thinking of how it's expired, though, that will probably make me hurl.  eventually.  maybe not until next week or so.  sometimes my brain has problems absorbing things right away.  today is my mother's 51st birthday.  the bitch got old, and fast.  i remember when she turned 40.  she moaned, "my life is half over."  to which i responded, "how long do you expect to last anyhow?  i'd say it's about 2/3 over."  that really made her day.  always, i was the sensitive one.

        aminals   i will never own a big dog.  big dogs run around sounding like elephants and oftentimes produce enough slobber to maybe take a bath in, if you were prone to bathing in slobber.  medical experts usually don't advise doing so.  they also produce other things, which i will graciously leave to your imagination.  i will never own a small dog, either, because small dogs always have a needy look on their face.  i knew a girl who had a dog the size of a rat; i would probably step on such a dog, and then have to dispose of the body.  i hear you're not supposed to flush dogs.  only fish can be flushed.  fish are so convenient.  i might own a cat, an aloof cat that suggests royalty in the way it steps around my various messes and snootily lifts its tiny cat head as if to say, "for shame!"  cats are independent animals; they don't need you or love you.  i, however, would win a cat's heart over by giving it an ultimatum.  "if you don't adore me," i would tell it sternly, "i will not change your litter box or feed you 'fancy feast.'"  cats go nuts for 'fancy feast.'  at least, that's what the commercials tell you.  i would not own a gerbil, because gerbils are ridiculous.  i do not want a bird, because birds chirp.  they are like caged wind chimes, and we all know how annoying wind chimes can be.  the kind of people that own wind chimes are the kind of people that would welcome the sound of a chirping bird at six in the morning.  those kind of people can shampoo my crotch.  also, condition.  i might be persuaded to own a pony, but only if i could lodge it properly, like in a stable, a tool shed, or tied out by my car.  you can't mistreat a pony; ponies have mad connections.  i would not mistreat my pony.  i would give it shoes to wear- red pumps with delicate bows on them.

        urlLink breaking news:  mcdonalds is *bad* for you!!   i recently finished reading " urlLink the da vinci code ," which is apparently all the rage these days.  "the da vinci code" uses a boring, typical plot formula to convey some rather atypical, interesting perspectives about  urlLink mary magdalen , urlLink  the holy grail , and  urlLink leonardo da vinci .  i disliked the novel and the way it was written, but everyone loves a good conspiracy.  i'm no different, especially when it concerns the catholic church.  damn right i'm eating meat on fridays during lent!  it's mind-boggling to imagine the research that went into "the da vinci code," although the amount of time he had to spend researching it does explain the lack of any good plot twists or development.  surely, he had to fly to france and england in order to write this novel.  surely, his publishing company paid for it.  surely, if i ever become a big, famous writer, someone will want to fly me to france and england for research purposes.   publisher:   but your novel takes place in ohio.  me:   yes, but the main character's ancestors originated in paris and london.  so it's crucial that i go.  publisher:   you don't even mention her ancestors.  or where they're from!  me:   duh.  that's because i haven't done the *research* yet.  anyhow, artistically speaking, i give the book one thumb up.  on a scale of three thumbs.

       i fainted in my dream, and i could feel my heartbeat accelerating as my body rushed to meet the floor.  just as i was about to hit it, my eyes flew open, and there i was in bed, a strangled *gasp* caught in my throat.  i had to catch my breath, and then when i looked down, i saw i was completely naked.  that startled me as well, until i realized that i always sleep in the nude... at least since i've moved out and don't have to worry about a mother or sister coming into my room in the morning to either borrow a sweater or bitch me out about something.  it's liberating.  but sometimes cold.

       i'm on page ten of my manifesto.  if my calculations are correct, i should instead be on page forty-seven.  my calculations are rarely correct, though.  i once tried to calculate my age, subtracting 1980 from 2003, and came up with pi.  i know for a fact that i am not  urlLink pi  years old.   urlLink phi  years old, though- that's a different possibility altogether.  chris has a fantastic beginning for a story.  it really bugs me when he tries to show me up like this.  the boy should stick to his own hobby- face painting, with a specialty in unicorns.  also, he dabbles in bionic arm design.  currently, he's got a really good "swiss army" idea- is it an arm, a bottle opener, a knife, or a toothpick?  is it a poker, a jabber, a scraper, or a fan blade?  oh, who can tell?!?!  my skin is disgustingly dry.  damn this winter weather and the way it ravages the body.  mother nature is going down.  also, i've got a few bones to pick with father time, the muses, and papa smurf.

       it's been snowing all day.  soon i leave for work and have to drive in the snow.  this does not make me happy.  i would take the private jet to work instead, but it's in the shop having the wet bar installed.  if anybody asks, it's been in the shop for seven years, about the time i bought it.  i think i stepped on a shard of glass today.  i think the shard of glass is enroute to my heart.  i should probably get a few key things done before it kills me.  hmm, what have i always wanted to do?  run naked through the snow?  shovel some snow while partially naked?  clear some snow off the car while wearing a leotard and heels?  no, none of those sound right.  so i guess i'll just chill and watch some t.v. for a bit.

       i thought this article, entitled  urlLink "dean: 'i have all kinds of warts'"  would be a startling and heartfelt confession of one presidential candidate trying to deal with the fact that he got "all kinds of [genital] warts" from a dirty tiajuana hooker.  i, of course, was let down.  you really have to watch what you say to the media.  when you say, "i have all kinds of warts," you can certainly bet that people are going to think first of your genitals.  i mean, that's a natural reaction, yes?

       i'm not getting along well with the english language these days.  you might say that we're on the outs.  it doesn't like me, and i absolutely hate it back.  i'm glaring at it from over my shoulder, spitting on it as i also stomp all over it, and, worst of all, i'm throwing heavy wooden objects at it out of a helpless sense of utter frustration.  i just don't know what to do with it anymore.  i feel it's time for our relationship to end, but i'm too old and lazy to start courting other languages.  plus, i don't necessarily think that spanish or german or chinese or french could ever possibly please me the way english used to, with its wacky spelling rules and lovable idioms.  damn this feeling.  damn it to hell.  i just wish we could make up.  the english language and i were working together on writing a story, and i feel like i did my part by sorting out the plot- but when it came to trying to weave the words together as to make the telling of the story lyrical and beautiful, the english language let me down and went out to play pool with the boys.  i tried to lock it out of the house, throwing its possessions and punctuations and dictionaries out on the lawn, but it was only a few minutes before i swore aloud and decided that i would let it back in- but compromise by still giving it the cold shoulder and using it only when necessary, such as when i was forced to order a pizza.  when it came back to me, it smelled of another writer's perfume and fiction, and entire, poetic sentences were lipsticked on its collar, on the collar that i had once starched.  i sobbed and heaved a bowling trophy at it, then kicked it in the proverbial you-know-what.  "it's over," i screamed.  "i don't need you."  it raised its eyebrows and said, "jackie, i will treat you like crap and not ever cooperate with you, and i will confuse you and hurt you and disobey you- but you will never break up with me.  you are dependent on me."  not wanting to speak and prove it correct, i heaved a second bowling trophy at it and crossed my arms.  they're currently still crossed, and i'm biting down on my lip so hard that i'm drawing blood.  i'm waiting for something- a fucking apology, a promise to work with me and not against me, or maybe for it to get down on its knees and beg me to forgive it and allow it to help tell my tale.  i'm waiting for it to say, "i have the perfect paragraph, jackie.  i'm ready to commit to this if you are."  and i will hug it and say, "yay!  but let's not collaborate on any more limericks, okay?"

       a while ago, i subscribed to the yahoo group devoted to david sedaris.  this is because i am madly in love with david sedaris, despite knowing that he's gay and it would probably never work.  anyhow, for the past three months, my david sedaris group has been sending me nothing but porn links.  i really don't think david sedaris would approve of this, and i'm not just saying this because none of the links are for *gay* porn.  david sedaris strikes me as the kind of guy who would maybe tell humorous stories involving porn but never actually look at any himself; what with all the hours he devotes to making me laugh, i don't see how he could find the time for it.  especially for the low quality sort of links these fucks have been sending me.  talk about your ugly wierdos- not that i was curious enough to open any of the links, but, you know, i'm just assuming.  anyhow, my point is that you should never join any online group, because eventually it's all going to come down to an inbox crammed with nasty porn links.  upon putting "david sedaris" into an anagram server, i found that the same letters spell, "a diver did ass."  i suppose when you think about divers doing asses, this whole ugly mess seems a lot easier to understand.  i mean, hell, i don't know.  who brought this up in the first place?

       today begins the year of the monkey.  did you know that those born in the year of the monkey are usually creative and intelligent?  did you know that i was born in the year of the monkey?  well, i guess not even the chinese can be right all the time....  we did karaoke last night; i did a request from a man at the bar.  i did it poorly, mind you, but let's remember the key point here- i'm now doing *requests.*  and they're not requests that i leave and not come back.

       stuff i'd like to learn to do, if i wasn't so lazy:  1.  cook.  they say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, which is bad advice if you're trying to stab someone, but probably good advice if you're trying to keep your boyfriend.  i have never cooked for chris.  i fear one day he's going to run off with julia child or emeril.  also, the way to JACKIE'S heart is through her stomach.  and i really want to establish a better relationship with myself.  2.  sew.  i'd like to make my own clothes.  i have no delusions that they would actually look good, these clothes that i would make, but i would feel such a sense of accomplishment to be able to say, "see this one-armed sweater without the neckhole?  yeah, i made this."  3.  swim better.  i can swim, but i tend to swim like elaine on seinfeld dances.  you know what i'm talking about.  4.  perform oral surgery.  i'd like to give myself a root canal.  half of the reason i'm putting off my root canal is my fear and dislike of dentists.  i don't fear or dislike myself; i'd be the perfect candidate to give myself a root canal!  5.  speak japanese.  just for fun.

        urlLink mikerowesoft.   a conversation w/ dr. eric today:   me:  my eye's not that red anymore, and it doesn't burn so much, so should i still keep taking the eye drops?  eric: you may want to, for another week, or if it's not bothering you, maybe you shouldn't.  me:  well, should i or shouldn't i?  eric:  are you wearing your contacts?  me:  no, i've been wearing my glasses.  can i wear my contacts?  eric:  you probably shouldn't for another week, but maybe if your eyes don't hurt, you can go ahead and try.  me:  so should i wear my contacts or not?  eric:  it's up to you.  me:  and what about the drops?  eric:  i don't know.  take them if your eyes are bothering you, or maybe for the rest of the week, or maybe just until your eyes stop hurting.  me:  okay, aren't you supposed to be the doctor here?  eric:  yeah.  listen, what do you want from me?  me:  never mind.   i don't understand how we stay in business.

       today is the birthday of edgar allan poe.  it's supposedly a mystery how he died; no autopsy was performed, but some people have their theories.  these theories include:  Beating (1857)  Epilepsy (1875)  Dipsomania (1921)  Heart (1926)  Toxic Disorder (1970)  Hypoglycemia (1979)  Diabetes (1977)  Alcohol Dehydrogenase (1984)  Porphryia (1989)  Delerium Tremens (1992)  Rabies (1996)  Heart (1997)  Murder (1998)  Epilepsy (1999)  Carbon Monoxide Poisoning (1999)  my personal theory is that it was a  urlLink bagel-related injury  that, without proper medical attention, eventually killed him.  this is why it's so important to eat PRE-SLICED bagels, people!  anyhow, i'm off track here.  what made me mention poe was  urlLink this article .  here's the guts of the article:   For 56 years, someone has marked the writer's birthday by slinking into the small cemetery where Poe is buried to place French cognac and three roses on his grave in the middle of the night.    when i die, i hope that somebody marks my grave on my birthday.  not someone that i knew while alive, because i'd frankly expect that (especially out of YOU), but years later, after everyone who knew me is long dead, i want some swedish man in a hooded cloak to trek to my grave and leave behind a pile of pez dispensers, a cheese wheel, and a martini glass.  the martini glass should be empty; i don't want to encourage drinking among the cemetery keepers.  i guess the man doesn't have to be swedish.  he could be a native of austin, tx perhaps.  he could be russian or korean.  i don't care.  i just want the pile of pez dispensers, the cheese wheel, and the martini glass- every year.  and i want anyone who steals that pile of pez dispensers, that cheese wheel, and that martini glass to befall an awful tragedy, such as having their foot crack off and float away into the sewer system.  frankly, it's not nice to take things that don't belong to you, even if you really want them.

       my eye is red and burns.  it burns, and it's red.  first the flu, now this.  i'm going to label this past week, "jackie gets every disease imaginable" week.  by "every disease," i mean the flu and conjunctivitis.  not, like, alzheimer's or something.  dan's band rocked mojoe's so hard last night that they were literally electrifying.  read:  dan's microphone continuously shocked him.  i heard a lot of songs by them that i hadn't heard before, and they were good.  even chris was impressed, and he has a heart of ice that can't easily be melted.  i hear it's a congenital condition.  i have a feeling my eye will fall out of my head sometime today.  that's why i'm bringing this net to work.

       i am part of an elite group of writers known as the "egw" or, "elite group of writers."  how did i become part of this historically ground-breaking group?  that, i can't say.  i also can't say why it is i'm not wearing pants.  i've always wanted to belong.  i never belonged to anything, not volleyball or softball or yearbook or the elks.  a lot of people get to be integral parts of very powerful groups.  some people are president of the debate club.  i personally dislike debating and will give in to about anything, even if your platform is that it's easy to make a pair of socks out of kool-aid and crackers.  i can't imagine what it would be like walking around with a crumby puddle of kool-aid and crackers in my shoes-  but, hey, if you say so, i'll agree.  i just want you to like me.  i didn't belong in the house of representatives or the screen actors guild.  i didn't belong in the express line at the grocery store or the carpool lane during rush hour.  i don't belong in this low-cut blouse designed to display maximum boob-age.  i never belonged in that class of '68 reunion party.  but i did enjoy the cheese tray.  anyways, i digress.  i now belong to something, and i call it the "egw," because that's what it's called.  by me.  an elite writer.  this elite writer bought a lot of croissants yesterday.  and today she wonders why.

       dear monica, rachel, phoebe, chandler, joey, and ross,  today is the last day that i do absolutely nothing.  this i promise, and you can rest assured that my promise will be kept.  how could i ever lie to you guys, especially after all we've been through?  you know my excuse, though, and it's a darn good one:  i've had INFLUENZA.  (sidenote:  doesn't INFLUENZA sound a lot more important than plain old FLU?)  i'm better now, but my cough is still alarmingly mucus-filled.  (sidenote:  my sister used to make fun of a kid named lucas; she called him mucus lucas.)  granted, i have done a few things this week besides watch the telly.  let's see now.  i've also had a lot of juice.  oh! oh! oh!  i did leave the house last night when chris and i saw "big fish."  true, while it was just moving from in front of one screen to another, it did require putting on my coat and exchanging currency.  i showered most days.  no, i didn't do any reading except for right before bed; i'm reading a hardcover right now, and in my weakened state, i had trouble holding the damn thing up.  i know i haven't written anything, either, but remember:  INFLUENZA.  stop making me feel so bad!  i watched talk shows and cooking shows and sitcoms and movies and news broadcasts and stand up comics and travel documentaries and cartoons and game shows.  what a variety!  but this is all i've done.  and i'm starting to feel a little bad about it.  don't worry, friends.  tomorrow's a new day.  and you do have my promise.  who wants some juice?!?!

       i called him "Cocky McCock-A-Lot," although i couldn't explain what "cock-a-lot" meant.  he was an asshole, and if i my brain hadn't been held captive by my hormones, i probably would have hated him.  you know what i'm talking about.  he was better than me, and i strived to be as smart as him.  i didn't strive so much, though, when "beverly hills 90210" reruns were on.  even star-eyed, i had priorities.  i saw him last night, finding his ocean-front house on complete accident during a freak 15 hour drive.  it was hurricane season year round, he proclaimed, and his projected intelligence almost distracted me from the fact that he was wearing a dress, a knee-length floral print baby doll affair.  his legs were hairier than ever, and he invited me in, but warned that i'd have to be quiet because his mother was sleeping.  also, the sound of my voice hurt his ears.  "what's with the dress?"  i finally asked quietly when he let me into the kitchen and began to organize the artichokes.  "it has to do with the philosophy of robert mitchum," he snootily declared, and i remembered that robert mitchum had a deoderant named after him.  "i never even liked you," i whispered.  "but it won't faze you too much, because i know you never even liked me, either."  his hair was wild, curly, long, entangled, and smelled of sleep and sweat.  his eyes leered at me from behind his crooked nose, and as he began to slither up to me, the dress swishing around his meaty thighs, i opened my mouth over the artichokes and began to retch.

        even things that are clearly not your fault are clearly your fault, through a chain of cause and effect so complex that it puts the heterotrimeric g protein to shame.  how is it all your fault?  baby, you were born.  this whole bloody, vomit-like, smells-like-sweet-and-sour-chicken-and-old-cheese mess could have been fully avoided if only you'd have come to earth as a dust bunny or a plank of wood.  don't bother saying that you're sorry; everything about you already does, from your circular posture to your ridiculous hair to the trail of toilet paper attached to your slipper.  you are to blame.  you were always to blame, and no matter what you do, or where you go, you will be the one that causes all the problems.   i found that in a fortune cookie.

       well, i'm sick.  really sick.  this is the first time in days i've even been able to sit up without getting dizzy, and even now i feel like keeling over.  i guess it's the flu, but for the girl who doesn't have health insurance (that would be me) it really could be anything.  pneumonia.  SARS.  a series of tumors.  who can tell?  what else is new?  well, this morning, i quit my new job via email.  didn't see that one coming, did you?  but i did, i quit my job.  technically, i guess i'm unemployed now, but i have a feeling lenscrafters will be taking me back with open arms.  i mean, i hope.  here's the thing about the new job:  it was awful.  they gave us this condescending script to read, and while i don't have a lot of morals, i do have enough to know that performing an act for innocent people MAKES ME SICK.  ooh, maybe that's why i have the flu.  also, another thing about the new job:  it was cubicle city, with a 45 hour workweek (no flexibility) that would promise to leave me drained, both physically and emotionally.  and i've made a decision.  this time i'm serious about it, too, so don't go saying you've heard it before, blah, blah, blah:  i really want to work on my writing.  if i really want to work on my writing, i can't have some career-ish job holding me down.  lenscrafters, i took you for granted, you with your flexible hours, your paid time off, your easy-as-pie-no-pressure sales positions- you with your convenience and roll-out-of-bed-at-8:30-instead-of-6:30 mentality.  you with your no commuting and friendly atmosphere where everybody knows your name....  my parents are going to kill me.  but i guess i don't care.  i'm not career oriented.  i'm not a professional go-getter.  i am truly wasting my degree.  but they'll learn to live with it.  one day i'm going to be a success in a field that really, really matters- to me, at least.  success in a career path???? that doesn't matter at all.

       it's 9 days into the new year, and i think i'm ready to set some "resolutions."  1.  i resolve to be positive about my career options/jobs while knowing that, really, a job is just a job, and it's no big deal what i do or do not do.  2.  cut down on stinky habits.  only engage in stinky habits in stinky social settings.  you know what i'm talking about.  3.  write my heart out.  4.  try to learn as much as i can this year.  improve my vocabulary.  know odd and quirky facts to quote at cocktail parties.  kick total ass in trivial pursuit, as opposed to jokingly answering "whoever pushed her!" to the question, "who discovered victoria falls?"  5.  david livingston.  6.  reeeeeelaaaax.  make every day "do what you feel day."  don't do the dishes so often.  let the apartment be even messier.  wear my clothes more than once before washing them.  it's not like i sweat or spill things on myself THAT much.  be lazier.  thrive in laziness.  except when it comes to personal pursuits such as  7.  writing my heart out.  8.  buy more boots and less sneakers.  but combat boots.  stomp around authoritatively.  9.  see friends more.  10.  visit carole in new york.  11.  improve handwriting.  my handwriting has been completely indecipherable for about six years.  is it a y or a g or an i or an s?  i don't know!  it could be a 9, a ?, or an & for all i know.  12.  don't be intimidated by anything.  except monsters.  13.  maintain ideal body weight.  i've never been anything but skinny, but every once in a while i fear that my metabolism's going to start slowing down, causing my body to balloon out until i can't share my seat on the tilt a whirl.  and i only tilt one way.  down.  14.  make a lot more lists.  15.  but cap them all at "15."

       i'm at work now.  how odd to write a blog entry at work.  i'm in my cubicle, my picture of christopher set up next to my monitor, listening to the sounds of typing all around me.  surely, my coworkers are all writing their blog entries, too, right?  oh, by the way, don't email me at my work email... BECAUSE I STILL DON'T HAVE AN ACCOUNT HERE!  i think it's a subtle way of them telling me not to get too attached.  in other news, a lot of people think that those pictures of mars were actually taken in the nevada desert.  that would explain the casino i was able to zoom in on.  and here i thought martians just liked to gamble.

       work has me really depressed, although i really can't pinpoint why.  these unpinpointed reasons are beside the reasons that i can pinpoint, which, for certain reasons, will remain unpinpointed as well.    in other news, the weather blows.  with wind chill this morning, it was 20 below.  20 below!!  i found a link for " urlLink cold weather tip for pets ."  i consider myself to be a pet, so let's rephrase this list as it would pertain to me.     COLD WEATHER TIPS, FOR Jackie!    Oh, the weather outside is frightful! But, inside your home it's warm and so delightful! Learn how to protect your Jackie, and all other frizzy little friends by following these tips when the temperature takes a dip.    Keep your Jackie indoors! Outside, Jackie freezes and can become lost, stolen, or injured.   Which way do I go?! Never let your Jackie run around on snow or ice-especially during a snowstorm.  Jackie might lose their scent in snow and ice and become lost.   Wipe off your Jackie's hands, legs, and stomach when she comes in from the snow or ice. Salt or other chemicals might make your Jackie sick if she swallows them while licking her hands. What's more, her palms are sensitive and might bleed if snow or ice covers them.   Brrrrr! If your Jackie has shaved her body hair, think about getting her a warm Jackie coat or sweater. Make sure she is protected on top and on her belly.  Also her "special" areas.   Never leave your Jackie, or any other friend alone in a car in very cold weather! A car can act as a refrigerator and your Jackie could freeze. So, if you take your Jackie on a trip, make sure you and your family take her wherever you go, even if she insists on hearing the rest of that commercial, so she can "act now!"   AHHH - CHOO! Some Jackies may be sensitive to the cold because she is sick, old, or simply just the oddball (type of Jackie) she is. If your Jackie is sensitive, try not to keep her outside too long.   Let's Play! If your Jackie spends lots of time outside playing with you, make sure you and your family give her plenty of food and water to keep her hair thick and healthy all through the winter.  I also recommend conditioner.   Snug as a bug! Make sure Jackie has a warm place to sleep that's off the floor and away from places where cold air might get in. They would be happy and warm in a Jackie bed or on a warm blanket.  Preferably next to a dark-haired, smooth-talking man.   what great advice.

       i hate the snow.  ever since i was a young eskimo growing up in eskimoville, alaska, i've hated the snow.  my eskimo daddy got me a bike for christmas once, and i was so excited that i nearly wet my eskimo pants.  "when can i ride it?"  i asked my daddy.  "when the snow's all gone, baby girl."  like a shmuck, i patiently waited for the snow to leave the skies and ground.  the months rolled by like a certain unused bicycle would have probably rolled by, and before you knew it, it was christmas of the next year.  the snow still covered the ground and fell out of the skies.  i turned to my eskimo daddy with a tear stained face and two clenched fists and screamed, "i never got to use my bike!"  "wait until you see what i got you this year," he proudly cried.  "ta-da!  it's a wading pool!"  eskimo daddy later died of hypothermia after trying to demonstrate how much fun the wading pool could be in eskimoville, alaska.  this is why i hate the snow.  plus, the whole bike thing.  i start my new job today.  i'm already depressed about it.  i went to an orientation on saturday; they divided everyone up into three management teams.  guess who wasn't on the list AT ALL??  if you guessed sammy hagar, you're right.  also, me.  i wasn't on the list at all, and if that isn't a bad omen for starting a new job, i don't know what is.  we'll see how it goes.  i'll give it my best shot being cubicle-girl.   she's sales-minded, she's professional, she has a phone with a lot of extensions- she's cubicle-girl!!     beware of all enterprises that require new clothes. - thoreau

        things i learned on our roadtrip to and from norfolk, virginia   norfolk's correct pronunciation is "no-fuck."  if you ever need to take a really bad piss, don't try to hold it through maryland.  signs for "indian springs" and "big pool" will not make it easy.  the pennsylvania turnpike is a black hole.  some never find their way out of it, but the ones that do make it will find that they've aged about forty years upon exiting.  the thing about hotels.com is that they don't necessarily tell you when your hotel is located in the ghetto.    "no-fuck" is crime-ridden, but pretty.  also, it's boring, but "nice," like that girl you want to set up with your brother.  the sales tax was low, but cigarettes cost about the same as chicago.  i find this odd.  it's virginia!!  what with being a staple, i'd figure a pack of marlboros would cost the same as a half gallon of milk.  funny how a place can be both crime-ridden and boring.  "no-fuck" is al capone on the couch in front of a documentary on hibernating bears.  virginia beach is awesome and hopping with parties and beach barbeques.  at least that's how we would imagine it to be during peak summer months.  in the winter, four out of five places are closed.  when the waterside bars in norfolk throw a new year's eve party and advertise "free buffet!" they forget to add that the "free buffet!" will only be available for 6 minutes before they clear away the food and deny that such a thing ever existed in the first place.  norfolk is home to a guy named dustin.  dustin lived in chicago and moved to norfolk.  dustin obviously didn't visit norfolk first before committing.  the tugboat museum is lots of fun.  not.  tug huntington is not the name of a man, but a boat.  if it was the name of a man, i would probably wager that "tug" was short for "tuglas."  the atlantic ocean is always happy to see you.  it loves you.  it loves you so much that its gift of shrimp and clam chowder will stay with you and make your mouth water for weeks afterwards.  possibly months; i'll update you in march.  if you go on a road trip with a pair of  urlLink hulk hands  in the backseat, you're in for an auditory treat at every bump.     done now.  may add more later.  hulk tired.

       well, turns out i'm a morning person.  all this time i thought i was a night person.  for a while, i was convinced i was a mid-afternoon person.  3 pm was my time to shine.  now, i'm waking up before 8 am every day and getting sooo much done.  for instance, today i cured feline leukemia.  it took a while, but it was just a matter of isolating the gene and then feeding it tomato sauce.  not just any tomato sauce- it was laced with a hallucinogen.  now i have to work on helping all those cats deal with the flashbacks and the sweaty tremors.  maybe tomorrow morning.

       this evening when i left work, i walked out to my car.  it was parked in a handicap spot.  the first thing i thought was, "who moved my car?"  because lord knows i would never be as oblivious as to park in the spot with the big "$100 fee" sign in front of it and the yellow wheelchair graphic painted right there on the asphalt.  the second thing i thought was, "huh.  i must have parked in the handicap spot.  oops."  i guess the walk into the store today *did* take less time than usual.  again:  huh.  luckily, there was no ticket.  which makes me think:  maybe i'll park there again tomorrow.

        urlLink boys, sign up for an imaginary girlfriend, or, girls, sign up to BE an imaginary girlfriend!!   i have found my calling.  "have fun and earn cash!"     We're looking for someone who can provide an authentic long-distance girlfriend experience with a minimum of actual interaction. This may require creativity or improv skills in some cases to ensure that the appearance of a real relationship is maintained. Of course no actual romantic relationships are involved and you will never be encouraged to be a real life girlfriend in any situation. Imaginary Girlfriends are just that -- imaginary!    i can totally do this.  i can send long, rose-scented letters detailing what a pillar he's been in my life; without him, i would have never made it through vet school.  he's such a rock.  next time i see him, i will reward him with heart-shaped hamburgers and a hot tub filled with rose petals.  i, of course, will be in the hot tub, too-  naked .  i'm one hell of a girlfriend, always writing letters about getting naked.  and saving dogs.  seriously, this seems like a load of fun.  now all i need to do is find a semi-decent picture of myself.  the only thing is, even though i would be imaginary, my "client" would surely fall in love with me from reading my letters.  so how would i let him down easy?  i'd have to say, "i don't even know how to make regular hamburgers, let alone heart shaped ones.  and, yeah, i also lied about being an extra in  along came polly .  you big fucking loser."

       the shirt i'm wearing to work today is one of those 1 piece shirts that looks like it's 2 pieces.  it appears to be a vest with a white blouse underneath it, but really it's just a vest with bits of a white collared shirt sewn all around it.  it's ri-goddamn-diculous.  supposedly, this is the fashion right now.  i don't even know why i bought it; i feel silly, like i'm trying to pull one over on the general public.  i'm going to go to work today and just wait for somebody to announce, eyes narrowed, "you don't fool me.  i know that's only one shirt, not two.  who the hell wears a vest surrounded by half a blouse?"  this is the point that i will start crying, blathering, "but it was on sale!  and the mannequin looked so damn cute in it."  the mannequin, they will point out, also had bigger boobs.  which doesn't have anything to do with the shirt, but, as a sidenote, i'd like for the fashion people to start using flatter mannequins, as to not cause me to drink.  either that, or to still use the big breasted mannequins BUT add overly large, but realistic, pointy nipples.  also, a little armpit hair.

        today's word of the day:  flibbertigibbet \FLIB-ur-tee-jib-it\, noun: A silly, flighty, or scatterbrained person, especially a pert young woman with such qualities.    chris and i are having a slumber party tonight.  we're renting movies, sleeping in the living room, eating popcorn, and drinking.  we're going to maybe have a pillow fight and tell scary stories.  i still haven't broached the issue of whether or not he will do my hair; i want a head full of little, kicky braids.  the slumber party was his idea; i just think he's excited about sleeping on the fold-out couch.  and who wouldn't be?  it's right in front of a tv.  aside from ash wednesday, it's also lumberjack day, national chocolate covered peanuts day, let's all eat right day, and national don't utter a word day.  i wish i were joking.  lumberjack day is to be celebrated by wearing flannel.  i'm sure it's also known as 1993 day.  i'm trying to absorb as much trivia as i can, for i've decided that i'm going on a game show.  it'll be fun!  even if i don't win, i'm sure to at least get a parting gift.  i sure could use a lifetime supply of vacuum cleaner bags.

          happy birthday to winslow homer, american painter that created above's picture "dressing for the carnival."  what a depressing carnival they must have been dressing for.  i got my promotion at work yesterday.  the pay increase will be more than the aforementioned measly 70 cents.  for this, i am thankful.  also thankful for:  dairy products, crossword puzzles, everything-must-go sales, and socks.  you know what i really hate?  web pages that, when opened, play really loud, obnoxious music.  what's the point, people?  help me understand.  i went to a poetry slam on sunday night.   i realized something while at this poetry slam:  it's not really a poetry slam- it's a journal slam or a lecture slam.  it's a girl up there reading something about this boy that she liked and how he could drink 40 oz of malt liquor in under 20 minutes and so that's why they didn't sleep together OR it's a boy up there telling you about having to be free, to be yourself, to not buy so much pepsi or nikes.  when i really went there for the poetry.  but it's a dying art, like proper usage of the turn signal or banana seat bicycles.  who's your favorite poet?  mine is  urlLink laura .   admittedly, she's a little "journal," but she's not so much "lecture."  besides, it's great.

       my lap top is whirring with the sounds of "erasure."  who doesn't love "erasure?"  okay, don't answer.  friday night, the bergers and the doughertys went out for a night of expensive sea food and drunken revelry at the karaoke bar.  i only say "the bergers" and "the doughertys" instead of "chris and jackie" and "dan and rachel" because there was one point in the bar where rachel and i were planning our weddings.  "chris is going to be one of your groomsmen, right?" i said to dan, to which he replied to chris, "help."  ah, yes.  it was a load of fun.  some of my other friends met us at the bar as well, and since i was in such good company, i kept drinking and drinking and drinking, only to pass out later and wake up the next afternoon with a lot of questions of where everyone went.  yesterday, i felt a bit ill all day.  chris and i spent some time at the hospital as well; his aunt had emergency surgery to remove a newly found tumor from her liver.  they're saying she should be okay, but there was one point in the hospital when the doctor came out to talk to chris' uncle, and the waiting room, filled with family (and me), became so horribly, deadly silent that i felt like crying a little myself.  it's hard to imagine anything bad happening to this particular aunt; she's a gorgeous, youthful lady, and bad things just don't happen to people who appear so happy and healthy and totally together.  that's just my take on things, but i'm a little naive.  anyways, again, she's doing okay at the moment, and since the tumor's now gone, let's hope that the problem itself is completely solved.  what a family chris has-- so close knit and always there for one another.  it's a large family, not like my little handful, and being there last night made me think of how lucky they all are, and what's really important- the people in your life.  so it's ironic that i wasn't able to hang out with carole last night due to how tired and drained i was.  carole's one of my best friends.  i'm considering introducing people to carole by saying that she's my sister-- and instead of drunkenly announcing to people that i've known dan since i was ten, i think i'm just going to tell people that he's my brother.  it's close to the truth, except for all those genetic details.  and now it's sunday morning.  it's a gorgeous february day, the kind that reminds you that spring isn't all that far away.  a morning like this, sunny and not very cold after a dull, grey, frigid winter, is like a taste of chocolate after being on a bran and grapefruit diet.  or a piece of steak or a baked potato topped with cheese and sour cream and bacon.  depending, of course, on what you're in the mood for.

        and now i share something deeply personal:   i went through some stuff this morning, and i found the wisest letter my father ever wrote me.  after i finished sobbing, i decided that i had to immortalize it, and share it, because so many things get lost.   what other venue do i have than this fucking blog?  i don't 100% agree with him for certain parts, but, well, here it is.   dear jaclyn,  i wrote this letter because i care about you and the relationship i hope to maintain with you.  when you stated that your mother and i should have divorced ten years ago, i was bothered, at first.  after some thought, i realized that you are young and do not fully comprehend what a long term relationship is about.  i have been married to your mother for 22 years, and i can tell you, situations can get very complicated when people live together.  disagreements and problems are not easily resolved.  add to that all the responsibilities of raising children and everyday problems that we have to bear, and you can easily lose focus, and make mistakes.  when i married your mother, i had only a few goals that i wanted to achieve in life.  i wanted to have a family with her, see that the children were raised properly, to have a close relationship with you and marcia, and to live "happily ever after."  of course, i wanted everybody's life to be perfect.  i did not want to be angry towards your  mother, and i did not want to set a bad example for you and marcia.  i had other goals also, some i achieved, and some i didn't.  though i have good intentions, i cannot be successful at everything i do, every relationship i have, and any endeavor i enter into.  i can only do as good as my skills allow.  sometimes that is not enough and i am not some perfect human being.  i am only your father.  i do know one thing- if i had divorced your mother 10 years ago, i would have missed 10 years of your life, and i'm glad i didn't do that.  jaclyn, you also stated that me and your mother will never get along well.  that we will always yell and argue.  well, i have to tell you i think as time goes on, me and your mother will get along better and better.  i will do my part and so will your mother.  this i truly hope.  i think that it can and will happen.  for myself, i feel that this time of my life is the most difficult, as i have everyone in the family depending on me.  i am responsible for everyone's welfare.  do you want me to give up?  is that what you think i should have done 10 years ago?  i can't abandon my family and not care about you, marcia, and your mother.  i made a committment to her and to you and marcia.  i can't walk away from this family and not see my goals come to fruition.  and i will not take the easy way out.  just like that song said, "you have to go through hell to get to heaven" is how i see this phase of my life.  finally, i hope i have been a good father to you and that you remember some good things about me.  don't be so hard on me and your mother, she gave you life and we both love you.  your father

       i was never good at connect four.  so it would follow that i'd be even worse at  urlLink connect five.   i'm not especially excellent at any game.  i'm above average in scrabble, but i do still get blown away by other above average players.  i'm decent in trivial pursuit, but it also helps if i'm playing against fourth graders.  charades?  you would think that being italian, i'd have the hand gestures down pat, but i notice that i tend to use the same hand gestures for a variety of different things.  like, "i'm eating some pasta" and "i'm in the navy and ship out tomorrow" look exactly the same.  i either suck or rule at games of chance.  but so does everyone.  i don't play sports.  once, i was on a softball team when i was a wee little one, and i've spent the last sixteen years trying to erase the whole incident from my head.  i can't play volleyball because i bruise my wrists.  i can't play tennis because my forearms are weak.  i can't play basketball because it's too much running around, and i'm usually in heeled boots.  ice hockey?  ha.  now that would make a good sitcom.  i'm not bad at mystery date.

        In 1872, the ship Mary Celeste was discovered at sea. Everyone aboard the Mary Celeste had vanished- the captain, his family, and its 14-man crew. The fate of the crew remains unknown. - from  urlLink www.infoplease.com   i wonder if they checked the closets.  i wonder if the ship had docked at a burger king, and when everybody got off to get their whoppers and dr. seuss ornaments, the ship simply floated away.  i wonder if, when thinking of the 14-man crew, they had confused the mary celeste with some other ship, when indeed nobody had ever boarded the mary celeste in the first place except the ghost pirate and his "i've been dead for fifteen years" co-pirate.  i wonder if there was a time machine on board and the occupants of the mary celeste will show up in 2006 aboard a cruise ship that i happen to be on as well.  then i can say, "let's use that time machine to go back to the renaissance!  but only for an hour or two because i'm having fun on this cruise."  i wonder if they all evaporated due to a science experiment gone haywire.  i wonder if the mary celeste was a suicide mission, and they all threw themselves overboard due to things their mothers said to them and their sophomore year homecoming dance not quite working out.  i wonder if they checked ALL the closets.

          not that i need a little skirt to hide my thighs- because, believe me, boys, they're fantastic- but i really want to find a 1930's style bathing suit to wear.  i want the skirt and the modest top and even the little sunhat.  why?  because it spells class. c-l-a-s-s.  class.  it took me forever to find that image, and it's not even a good one, but i felt kind of odd searching through pages and pages of bikini-clad girls in order to find that suit i had in mind.  it started to strike me, after a while, as humorous, perverted, and homosexual.  although i am humorous, i am no perverted homosexual.... not that there's anything wrong with that, as all of my perverted homosexual friends will attest to- but, anyways, this is the image that you image-thirsty fucks will have to deal with.  find me a bathing suit like this, okay?

        urlLink i love roger williams university.   last night, i had a hundred dreams.  i dreamt of ghost babies in cowboy suits, old folks at the old folks home, the deep south, working at wal-mart, shopping at wal-mart in order to find the perfect gift for a spoiled rich girl that was dying, alternate universes, moving to memphis for love, missing my love, living in a stinky garage, toys that had personalities, decorated mansions twinkling in the nighttime, my parents driving me around in a station wagon, having the newspaper delivered three times a week, attending school in my underwear, and playing miniature golf with the sister of a kidnapped child.  i think i let her win.  today is presidents' day.  let's enjoy a quote by roosevelt on this day:  "speak softly and carry a big stick."  now let's enjoy a quote by jackie on this day:  "opticals are always busy on presidents' day, which is why i go to work muttering softly and carrying a big stick."

       there was sherry in the lobster bisque and wine in my glass, and thus i was completely out of it by about 7 pm last night, passing out in my bed and waking briefly only to strip out of my clothes and pop my contacts out.  you might call it a waste of an evening, but this morning i woke up at 8 am feeling fresh and alive after all that sleep.  today i work only 4 hours, which is sad because i have to work but good because the 4 hours should fly by.  hopefully.  i'm feeling really stressed out about my job lately, but i pray that those feelings will pass.  i also pray that in a couple of months, i maybe won't be there be anymore.... if chris gets this other job or if i get off my ass and get another job.... sigh.  working is such bullshit.  i talk to people who love their jobs, and i just don't understand it.  sometimes i think i should become a waitress or a bartender.  really just chuck my degree even farther out the window and take some menial job that requires less thought so i can concentrate on my other pursuits.  i'm jealous of  urlLink andrew  and  urlLink jessica - andrew who's trying to make it as a writer and jessica who's making a career out of a passion for photography.  i'm jealous of  urlLink dan  who makes coffee for 25 hours a week and then spends another 30 hours making art and music.  they're braver than i am, more ambitious, and not afraid to follow their dreams.  this girl i work with, gina, is 19 years old.  she complains of how old she is and how she fears that her life is going to be spent doing menial work while lacking any creative endeavors or exciting adventures.  "gina," i sighed, "i'm 23.  imagine how the fuck i feel."  i guess even 23 is not that old, but the caution signs are going up.  they're bright yellow with big flashing lights, and i'm ready to start paving out that detour.  i need less talk and more walk.  less words, more action.

        In the Middle Ages, the belief that birds chose their mates on St. Valentine's Day led to the idea that boys and girls would do the same.   well, that's just great.  so if birds do it, we gotta do it, too.  if, say, last week, i believed that a bird shit on my windshield, should that lead to me and my friends shitting on each other's windshields as well?  how many shitty windshields is it going to take, my brothers, until we realize that we are not birds?  as long as we're on this topic, i'm not eating bread crusts off the ground or building my home out of twigs, mud, and old condom wrappers.  i'm also not feeding my young by first chewing up their food for them and then regurgitating it straight down their throats.  birds are fucked up, man.  happy valentine's day!

       some of you may read chris' blog.  others may disregard it entirely, knowing that all the action you could want or need is right here.  still others may occasionally click on the link to "infidels" and then have to immediately exit, having grown nauseous from all the wacky changing colors.  his blog is a land where nothing is constant; hues morph into other hues, fonts are transformed with the click of a button, icicles grow up, and children grow down.  it's a great blog, though.  it wouldn't be number one on my list if it wasn't- besides the fact that i'm sleeping with the author.  anyhow, chris was contacted by microsoft for a possible job.  they even told him that his lack of a degree was okay by them.  now, we both know it's kind of a longshot, but if chris were to get this job- we'd be living in seattle.  does everyone here know how i feel about seattle?  it's great.  it's beautiful, hip, progressive, clean, and full of sushi.  when i was there, i got the impression that every person i came across was intelligent and cool, artistic and witty.  kind of like yours truly.  it's a wonderful city, and since i went a year and a half ago, i haven't stopped talking about how i would want to live there.  so if chris were to get this job, our decision would be relatively easy- except for the fact that it would kill my father, i'd miss our friends, and i was just promoted.  but, hey, the possibility of moving is exciting for me; the possibility has always been exciting.  again, there's a good chance that this recruiter may never contact chris again, but it's been an interesting week, full of interesting day dreams.  now, if this company knew what was good for them, they'd hire chris in a heartbeat, because he's the smartest man alive (also, cutest), but sometimes the special ones get overlooked.  just ask all the boys that didn't date me.  oh, but how i digress.

          everybody adores christopher pike, even adults.  which is why i'm starting a club called  grown-ups loving pike , or g.u.l.p. for short.  since i came up with acronym, i'm automatically president.  in other news, yesterday was a hellish day at work.  the girls in the doctor's office were unruly and overly rowdy, and then there was the doctor himself, telling jokes with sexual innuendoes in front of customers and then getting so out of control as to knock the clock off the wall.  it was as if everyone had been drinking, but believe me, if there had been alcohol around, i would have found it.  now, in my other store, i loved these shenannigans.  in this store, when i know i'm stepping up to management and will be accountable for all this crap- oh, how i hate the shenannigans.  it's like somebody up there is trying to teach me a lesson.  anyhow, did you know christopher pike's real name is kevin macfadden?  if he had written under his real name, i might have named the club  macfadden's older reading krowd , or m.o.r.k.

          what a great picture.  here's my list of things to do:  1.  emerge entire body into vat of lotion, as that seems like the "simple" solution these days to my dry-skin troubles. 2.  continue to avoid certain customer's insistent phone calls at work, urging other associates to "take a message" when he calls, as i'm obviously too busy readjusting my socks. 3.  design and execute perfect valentine's day gift- or just stop at hallmark on saturday afternoon. 4.  resume daydreaming about doing that book-signing in new york after the release of my first bestseller.  resume not thinging about what that bestseller could possibly be about. 5.  stop signing other people's bestsellers at the train station or else face having my train riding privileges revoked.  again. 6.  finally win that jackpot at  urlLink pogo.com  7.  stop mentioning  urlLink pogo.com  to other people, as that decreases my chance of winning said jackpot. 8.  consider starting rigorous exercise program. 9.  consider starting rigorous "eating and lounging" program. 10.  finish writing that letter to stephen hawking regarding my own personal black hole theory, which involves chicken dumpling soup and gremlins. 11.  work on posture.  walk with a book on my head.  rig up a system where i will get electrified, or sucker punched, if i dare slouch. 12.  memorize all elvis songs for upcoming trip to graceland so that i can wow all the other fans.  get studded suit and sideburn wig back from dry cleaners. 13.  finish reading kurt vonnegut novel so i can start the young adult christopher pike book that i got from the used book store.  remind self not to let anyone know that i'm still reading young adult christopher pike books. 14.  delete 13. 15.  delete 14 after deleting 13 as 14 will no longer make sense. 16.  should probably delete 15, too.  and... d'oh!

        Better to write for yourself and have no public, than to write for the public and have no self.  --Cyril Connolly    hmm.  what was cyril connolly trying to convey when he uttered these words?  who is cyril connolly in the first place?  and what kind of name is "cyril?".  the writing's not going too well.  even the blog entries are painful to type.  i realize sometimes that i don't have all that much to say after all.  do i write for myself?  yes, but then i dislike myself- both the writer and the reader.  do i write for the public?  pssh.  you know, if somebody could offer me a weekly column in, say, "the el paso times," i would write for the public- meeting my deadlines and really having a passion about the whole thing- and the public would love it.  i would make the public laugh and think and say, "isn't this girl phenomenal?"  but since no one has offered me a weekly column in "the el paso times," i refuse to even try.  why work for something you're not guaranteed to get?  well.  that doesn't sound like the can-do spirit, now does it?  it's a good thing i'm bipolar and tend to change my mind, feelings, and outlook every 16-23 minutes.  note:  i am not really bipolar.  and it's more like 13-17 minutes.

        my back twin   i met my back twin.  from the back, she looked exactly like me with her curly, chin length hair, her thin frame, and her clothes that mirrored something i would wear- an orange hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and funky running shoes.  val noticed her first, asking chris, "you do remember where we're sitting right?" for fear that he'd go join my back twin's table on his way back from the restroom.  we decided that i needed a picture with my back twin; i scooted my chair a little closer to her table and tried to sit near her without her noticing as chris snapped a picture of our backsides.  i walked around her table a few times, real casual-like, to get a look at her face, but she was definitely not my front twin with her pale, birdlike face and emerald-colored eyes.  i got jen and nikki to walk with me, jen snapping another picture as we passed her backside, and all of us staring at her front side rather obviously as to continue the comparing.  "you have to approach her," everyone agreed, and finally i got val to go with and do the talking.  we headed over to my back twin's table and val leaned in and said, "i'm sorry to bother you, but from the back, you look like my friend jackie."  as she said that, i turned around to reveal my backside as if to say, "yeah?  yeah?  you see it, right?  isn't this great?"  i turned around again.  my back twin was giving us a look as if to say, "alright, you creepy assholes, go back to wherever you came from."  we quickly excused ourselves.  i was a little sad that our conversation didn't last longer;  i wanted to ask, all wide-eyed and hopeful, "is your name jackie, too?"  but seeing my back twin was one of my happiest moments ever, period.

        what i've been doing   not much.  got talked into buying three of the same sweaters, but in different colors, by an excellent salesperson at the gap.  oh, shame on me.  chris and i got a joint checking account together.  if that isn't commitment and trust, i don't know what is.  i will not be telling my parents about this joint checking account until chris and i have official plans to marry; at the bank yesterday, i could hear my dad's voice in my head lecturing about financial security and what a *smart* girl would do.  but it only makes sense; chris and i pay the same bills, so why shouldn't bill money come from the same account?  right?  right.  i filed my taxes today and am getting a b-e-a-utiful refund from the man.  it's so nice to no longer be a dependent on somebody else's taxes, and since i filed online, i'll be eating prime rib and lobster in under ten days.  we had sushi last night for dinner; the sushi came around on a kind of train track that circled around where all of the customers sat, and when you saw something you liked, you just reached out and grabbed it.  it was kind of neat, like a rotating buffet.  and you know how i feel about both buffets and things that rotate.  mmm, yeah.  i sang "black velvet" at karaoke the other night, and it was a big disaster.  the night before, my friend amy and i went to another karaoke bar, and let me tell you, i don't what it was about that night, but i have never gotten hit on so much in my life.  i guess that's what happens when you put a semi-attractive girl in a bar full of drunk men.  i've been reading "player piano" by kurt vonnegut, and my love for him has been rekindled.  he lost me after "timequake," but now we're back together again, and happy.  i've been watching a lot of "the king of queens" on channel 26, the "u."  you know what show i'm talking about- fat, funny man with skinny, smarter, more attractive wife.  together, they are an unanimated marge and homer simpson or peter and lois griffin, an updated ralph and alice kramden, and a drew carey plus every sexy babe he's ever, rather unbelievably, been with.  oh, tv.  my pizza's done- and a little misshapen, i might add.

       the tax train is pulling into refundsville, population jackie.   at least, i hope it is.  i'm assuming that i'm going to get a huge pile of cash back from the government after i sit down and calculate my various calculations, but i suppose i've been wrong about other things before.  namely that time my phone was ringing and i thought for sure that it was ferdinand magellan- for real, i couldn't have been more wrong about that one, and it still embarrasses me today to even bring it up.  so i probably shouldn't have said anything.

        health class   today a patient told me he had gout.  for some reason, not knowing what gout exactly is, i associated it with the clap.  there are, i now know, marked differences.    gout is a rheumatic disease.  the clap is gonorrhea.  gonorrhea is not a rheumatic disease.    gout affects the joints- mostly in the feet- while the clap affects a man's wiener.  you do not get the clap in your feet or gout in your wiener.    you get the clap from having sex, while, from what i understand, even virgins can get gout.    the clap causes tender testicles.  gout causes tender joints.  the testicles are not considered joints.  so, while you have the gout, your testicles may be fine.    if you have gout, they say you should avoid red meat, shellfish, and beans.  those with the clap can still enjoy the red meat, shellfish, and bean buffet down at the sizzler, yet should probably avoid intercourse with me or any of my friends.  those with gout can still have intercourse with me or any of my friends...  but, come to think of it, probably not.  the clap and gout do have one thing in common, dear students:    gout symptoms may be triggered by too much alcohol.  the clap symptoms may be triggered by too much alcohol as well... when the alcohol leads to a one night stand with kiki the bar whore.    join me for our next session when we discuss the differences between a gun shot wound and the flu.

        it really is a good deal   i was looking through amazon and saw that they now sell engagement rings. amazon.  who would buy their loved one an engagement ring through amazon, what with their great prices and express shipping and the fact that you can also buy a copy of kate chopin's "the awakening" to go along with it?     oh, man.  so i went ahead and picked one out for my wish list, skipping right over the inexpensive and moderately priced ones because i know that i'm worth it.  oh, god, i'm so hysterical.

        band name   i decided that if i start a band- which is very likely considering my incredible, and many, musical talents coupled with the fact that i have the determination of a bulldog- i'm going to call it "klondike 5."  this, of course, is a reference to the fake phone numbers people give in books and movie.  also, there will be 5 members in my band.  me  urlLink alex gonzalez of the chicago cubs  ed norton john cusack  urlLink michael vartan   i don't care if any of the other members can't sing or play any instruments.  i think we'll be popular nonetheless; also, it'll be oh-so-much fun for me.  "alex, you'd better let me feel that muscle at least one more time.  and do another dimple check.  oh!  there they are!!"  tee hee.  watch for "klondike 5" during our nationwide tour, where we'll be certain to assure you that no other city rocks like [your city].   p.s.  i'm also now blogging with the dudes from  urlLink messiahforhire .  i got a personal invitation via email and everything.  it was very exciting to know that my blogging voice is being heard out there, and that people like my writing.  now if only some big fancy new york publishing agency would send me an equally nice email, eager to publish that yet-to-be-finished novel i've... yet to finish.

        well, what if there is no tomorrow? there wasn't one today.   today is groundhog's day, where critters such as punxsutawney phil, pothole pete, dixie dan, and buckeye chuck pop out and hope not to see their shadow.  see, here's how it works for me.  if a long winter is predicted, then this whole thing is balderdash.  if spring is on its way, then, by god, this is tradition.  it's science.   this is how it works.   you've got to believe in whatever's convenient.  i woke up this morning knowing it was groundhog's day.   groundhog's  day.  and i thought to myself, "i wonder if the penguin will see it's shadow."  then i paused, the gears in my head slowly cranking. after a drawn out moment, i realized that groundhog's day has nothing to do with penguins.  i was obviously thinking of easter, which is all about penguins hopping down the bunny trail and shit.

        super bowl XXXVIII   the roman numerals are a bit much, don't you think?  i dealt with them for "rocky I" through "rocky V," and that was fine, but with the super bowls, i think they're getting a little out of control.    i found this quote in an article concerning super bowls and roman numerals:   Legend has it that former NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, now deceased, wanted Roman numerals used to give the big game more pizzazz.    i disagree about the roman numerals providing "more pizzazz."  if the nfl commissioner wanted to make "the big game" more exciting, he would have cut out all of the football stuff and instead just had the following elements at some huge festival park in, say, milwaukee:  1.  balloon animals 2.  naked people flipping through fiery hoops 3.  stuffed mushroom cap appetizers served by the entire cast of " urlLink fame " 4.  the beatles, all of the beatles, together for one last concert during half time.  i'm not sure if this would involve time travel or resurrection from the dead, but it would be cool either way.  right? 5.  a super-splash-happy-extra-long-and-windy water slide 6.  the comedic stylings of  urlLink brian regan  7.  motorcycles 8.  fireworks 9.  a petting zoo of mythical creatures 10.  trampolines 11.  face painting 12.  cuss words  cuss words always rile me up.  also, they're good for me.   In 1997, Superior, Wisconsin, judge Charles Schaefer denied unemployment benefits to a woman who quit her job at Kentucky Fried Chicken. The woman said she quit because of the amount of vile language in the workplace. Schaefer ruled, "Use of vulgar and obscene language can promote group solidarity."   see?  swearing helps me make friends.

       baseball season started at four in the morning.  my darling christopher slept on the couch last night so that he could wake up by four and watch that first game.  he came into our bedroom at six-thirty in the morning to talk about the devil rays, who apparently only have one team member named 'ray.'  i understand liking baseball, but i don't understand such extreme passion.  it's kind of inspiring, in a "why can't you be more passionate about other things too?" sort of way.  what would i wake up at four in the morning for?  brian regan?  newsradio?  a flight to vegas?  a sub sandwich with all the fixings?  i don't know.  i'm considering composing a letter to our upstair neighbors.  it will begin, "dear fatasses," and go on to detail how i have heard every step and movement that they have taken.  the two adults don't leave the house during the day, ever, and so  i will also enclose information on how to jump start their careers by becoming truck drivers.

       not a good week for working.  yesteday, i left the house at 10:30 am and didn't return until 8:00 pm.  tomorrow, i work 11 am to 9 pm.  wed, 10 am- 8pm.  thursday, 11-9 again.  friday, i lucked out with 8 hours instead of the usual 10.  they'd better watch out, or i'm going to get lazy on them.  it's getting to be a bit excessive.  on to other news, i've been a bit of an avid reader lately.  what have i been reading?  young adult novels.  again.  or still.  i found a thrift store near where chris works, which is nice because i was beginning to think i'd never see one again, and i loaded up on the christopher pike and the lois duncan.  i also got a t-shirt from a roselle youth basketball team (i'm number one), and wondered who would buy a used jigsaw puzzle.  it's guaranteed that you'd be missing a few pieces, and that, my friend, would be frustrating.  anyhow, about these books.  they're my secret passion.  not so secret passion.  i'm telling everyone i know that i think they're great.

       this morning, i'm listening to  nina gordon.    her song, 2003, could have been a soundtrack to a day of my life.   ...i want to meet in 2OO3  i want to see what the future can bring to me  and when i do i'll meet you here my darling and when i'm free  i'll be waiting where i said i would be  my love will you wait for me?  what we've found is such a precious thing  that's what i 'm trying to sing ...   i met chris in 2003, waiting in the sushi restaurant where i said i would be.  i was so nervous that i think i ordered my glass of plum wine before he even showed up, just to calm my nerves a bit.  i saw him approach the door of the restaurant, and i smiled as he pushed instead of pulled.  he was being a little shy at first; i babbled to make up for it, briefly excusing myself after the main course to go pick rice out of my teeth and make sure that my hair looked decent.  i liked him right from the start, and i went home hours later feeling, for once, just happiness, and nothing else.  most first dates i'd had made me feel happy- but also a little doubtful.  not this time, buddy.  the next monday, i remember riding around in my car with dan, telling him about my date with chris.  "do you think he'll call you?"  dan asked.  i was holding the steering wheel, in complete control, and i responded with certainty, "yes."  and now here we are.  i think that if there's ever a ceremony that involves me and chris, "2003" should play at the reception afterwards.  not that i'm actively planning any ceremonies- but, you know, you have to have a *little* foresight.  i've always liked nina gordan.   addendum:  i'm an idiot.  we met in 2002.

       i am intrigued by other girls.  i like to analyze what makes them pretty or desirable, and i enjoy wondering what, exactly, it is that makes them attractive, or unattractive, to those around them.  i am quick to criticize, but i add up their positive attributes just as rapidly.  it's like a mental inventory:  sally has long legs, a nice laugh, and knows a lot about how the credit industry works.  on the down side, she cakes on the make-up, is as funny as a pile of kindling, and appears to have lopsided boobies.  janet has silky hair, a masters degree in painting, and is very kindhearted towards animals.  unfortunately, she has crossed eyes, reproachable posture, and doesn't know how to spell "boat."  mavis is slender, intelligent, and sings like aretha franklin.  too bad she smells of fish, tends to boss around the elderly, and is stuck with the name "mavis."  you see how it works.  i know i'm not the only person who does this.  guys check out other guys, and, probably more so, girls check out other girls.  it's all in the circle of life: our observations of survival of the fittest, natural selection.  also, we want to know where girl a got her shoes from, and the name of her manicurist.  i wonder what somebody would say about jackie.  jackie is smart, funny, and all around fantastic.  it's a shame, however, that she's flat as a board, consistently whining, and is often caught staring rather openly at other women.

       there's a ford taurus parked in our parking lot that is the exact same year and color of my own old ford taurus.  every time i see it, i'm reminded of how my very first car came to be  f ound  o n  r oad,  d ead.  it was the fall of some year.  i was driving down to u of i to visit a friend.  "could you pick up another friend of mine?"  this particular friend asked.  i agreed, only to find out that this guy i was bringing down- let's call him bobby- happened to have lived in my house.  we had bought the house from his family, and bobby had once slept in the same bedroom i now slept in now.  on the way down, he regaled me with stories of all the dead cats that he had buried in my yard and the kinds of icky boy things he had once stored in the closet that now held all of my shoes and turtlenecks.  he was a wierd guy; i think he tried to convince me that his parents had sold the house because they were certain that it was haunted by escaped slaves using the underground railroad.  or something.  we smoked a lot of cheap cigarettes on that car ride, and bobby was giving me the creeps in a real bad way.  i pressed my foot to the accelerator in order to get to u of i faster, and my car shook with speed.  finally, we pulled off onto the exit.  it was then that my car started to smoke, and, suddenly, although it was running, it refused to move at all.  i freaked out.  bobby had to get out of the car and push it all the way to his friend's house, and it was there that i had to phone my father.  we had just gotten into a fight a few days earlier about me going to champaign; my parents had been convinced that the taurus wouldn't make it.  my dad answered on the second ring, "it made it," i stated, near tears, "but now i can't get it to move at all."  the transmission had blown.  my dad drove down.  bobby was there when he arrived to check out the damage, and he quickly introduced himself to my father.  "do you know who i am?"  he asked meaningfully, glancing at me.  my dad shrugged, probably wondering why the hell he would know this semi-retarded boy smoking from a generic pack of cigarettes.  "i used to live in your house," bobby continued.  "i slept where your daughter sleeps now.  i buried cats in your yard.  and, oh yeah, the house is haunted.  with slaves."  i wanted to just go home with my dad that night, but instead i stayed the rest of the weekend, suffering through bobby's stories and finally, when my friend was to drive me home on sunday, i gave him eight dollars so that he could take the train instead.  i was done with him- i didn't want to hear anymore about why his parents had had giraffe printed wallpaper in the kitchen, or how his dad had often run into the spirit of harriet tubman.  or whatever.  later that week, i bought my cavalier.  and then i scrubbed the walls and floor of my closet.

        for janice   you cut the strings of your white balloons before you could watch them deflate.  your party stood in an empty lot and reached in vain for the shrinking dots; you say with nothing tied down, there is so much space to play.  but while there's ground to run around, it's only pavement without pretty- no decorations to inform of festivities, and you.

       one of the colors we're painting our [new] apartment's walls will be "kissin' cousins."  how's that for your bizarre dutch boy names?  en espanol, es "primos carinosos."  i'm writing poems lately, but mostly in my head.  they're much more clever and sharp inside my brain.  once they hit the paper, or screen, disappointment will be inevitable.   so, for now, i am the poet that does not actually write any poems.  other dutch boy colors include: i love a parade, pledge of allegiance, and paddywack.  they are all just shades of purple.  if i had to name some colors, i'd try to incorporate the word "testicular" as much as possible.

       there's a recall on my car because apparently the steering column on my model has been known to burst into flames.  now, this i don't need.  as if i didn't have enough fire hazards in my car already, what with the styling products in my hair, the lit cigarette dangling from my mouth, and the jug of kerosene i like to carry around in the passenger seat for emergency situations that call for one jug of kerosene... and a pipecleaner. always got to carry around a few pipecleaners.  i can see it now.  i'm driving to an awards ceremony given in my honor.  the weather is 80 degrees and sunny, and i'm wearing a beautiful purple gown that also happens to have the flammability of chicago during 1871.  practicing my speech in the rear view mirror, i am just getting to the part where i thank all the little people out there who allowed me to step on them on my glorious journey to the top... of what i don't know, but let's say it's in a field that involves both irrigation and linguistics... when i accidentally beep the horn.   "oops," i say, when suddenly the whole front of my car explodes.  see, just a simple beep of the horn had knocked a few of those frayed, shoddily arranged wires together in such a fashion that me and my car become a homogenous mixture of "fireball" in under 5.9 seconds.  my beautiful purple gown is ruined.  my eyebrows have burned off my face, which is alarming in itself- but even more so alarming when you realize that EVERYTHING has burned off, and the girl you once called "jackie" is now just a fiery pile of ash coming to rest against the trunk of an elm tree which happens to reside in a school yard.  and all of the watching children will later need therapy to get over the sight.  the recall letter gave me a number to call.  it's sitting in my car right now, and will probably be destroyed in the fire, along with my map and sun glasses.

       i've choreographed the perfect dance to  urlLink u2's elevation .  any friend that's seen me while a wee bit intoxicated would know this dance.  i mime the mole, living in a hole, and digging up his soul.  i orbit my hips and touch my finger to the corner of my lips.  going down, excavation, is me twisting closer to the ground.  during elevation, i shoot way up.  i also "shoot me from a gun," aiming, squinting, and then firing off my invisible handgun.  my arms become flapping wings when "you make me feel like i can fly."  i'm doing air-guitar when i'm strung out like a guitar, only to have my mind educated in the next line, which looks like me pointing at my head and nodding emphatically as to say, "yes! yes, i get it now, teacher!"  i clutch my heart and pitifully gaze outwards when love is to lift me out of these blues.  i believe in you.  i point at you.  i also point at me.  can't sing but i've got soul.

       i'm getting my hair highlighted today, which is generally something that i do not do.  my cousin lisa highlighted my hair a few years ago, and it looked really good for a while, the random golden strands making the curls stand out like proud old men on veteran's day.   then the highlights grew out a little, so my big plan was to just dye my entire head BLACK as to get rid of the highlights entirely. because lord knows my reputation depends on *not* having my roots show-  i just can't be that girl.  the girl on the box looked gorgeous and hip with her jet black hair; i looked like a sickly immigrant.  i tried dying it back to brown; the thing about having black hair is that it just doesn't get any lighter.  i called lisa.  "i look like a cuban refugee in bad need of vitamins," i wailed.  after bitching me out for not being patient enough to wait for her to just touch up my roots, she came up with a foolproof solution.  her solution was to bleach my already intensely damaged hair once again, and then just pour on a bottled version of my natural brown.  what a good idea.  i went over there on a sunday.  first we ate a meal of chicken smothered in cheese; then she got to work.  hours later, when we were done, she squinted at me in the harsh bathroom light.  "it looks orange," she stated.  "especially this circular patch right on the back of your head.  i must have left the bleach on a little too long there.  let's try to dye it again.  we've already fucked it up this far, might as well go all the way."  another hour later, it was still an uneven orange, with the brightest spot shining like a bald spot, or a yarmulke, on the back of my skull.  "screw it," i said, sighing.  "i'll just wear it in a pony-tail for a while."  and that's what i did.  now, today, i attempt to enter the world of highlights again.  and when my highlights grow out?  i'll shave my head.

        May those who love us love us.  And those that don't love us,  May God turn their hearts,  And if He doesn't turn their hearts,  May he turn their ankles,  So we'll know them by their limping.   Irish curse   there's snow again outside.  it's snowing as i write this.  i am not pleased.  gina and i went to ikea on sunday.  i never thought i'd be so impressed by some crappy home furnishings store... but i was.  maybe it was all the colors and shapes.  maybe it was because the store was the size of disneyworld.  maybe i thought it was cool that there was a separate escalator for the shopping carts.  i keep thinking of ikea's role in "fight club."  but i know i'm going to go back there come june to buy that cute little desk and chair i saw.  also, the little decorative boxes that fit inside the bigger decorative boxes.  ha.  ha.  ha.  i'm a bit ashamed.  but, more than ashamed, i'm a bit eager.  and i've already decreed that no one's allowed to look down upon me.

       7th grade  it was an awful year for me, probably the worst of my life thus far.  only two or three people in all of existence know why that year was so bad, and i think that "three" is possibly too generous a number.  it's something i don't ever speak of.  i certainly will not write about it, although i will say that it was one of those things that left its mark like a brick dropped from a plane right onto a square of fresh, wet concrete.  let me tell you about other things, who i was.  i had glasses that i wore only in class; the rest of the world was a smudge that i couldn't make out.  i had to lean down to see the lock on my locker, my nose only three inches from the numbers.  i was poor vision and unruly hair.  as i had no earning income of my own, i wore the clothes my mother bought me: namely pants that were always a little too short for my longish legs and tent-like sweaters that look ridiculous on my too skinny torso.  7th grade was when i started wearing make-up.  i painted on bright red lips and drew eyeliner with a heavy hand.  i didn't wear foundation; my mother gave me a bottle of goo once that i tried at home, only to enter a state of shock when i saw my garishly orange face staring back at me in the mirror.  "no thanks, freak," i told her.  "i'll just stick to the raccoon eyes and clown mouth."  i only had a handful of friends.  samantha and i had sleepovers nearly every week; it was always more fun at her house.  i loved the smell of her basement; even my little sister, who would sometimes come with me, would later comment on it.  marcia would remark, while we were at home watching tv, "you know, samantha's basement sure does smell nice."  neither of us could figure out what it was.  in samantha's basement, we watched "blazing saddles" and "my blue heaven" and ate little caesar's pizza and laughed for hours about farts.   we were two classy young ladies, and we were going to be friends until the end of time.  the end of time, apparently, came four years later.  by that time, i had contact lenses and was able to see all the way down the hallway as opposed to half an arms length away.  i remember little things about seventh grade.  i got into my first and only physical fight.  it was with a deaf girl, and she just about kicked my ass.  i don't even remember what it was about; i think that she just wanted to start a fight, and i was the only one that was weak enough to take it.  i couldn't have possibly insulted her; even if i had, she wouldn't have been able to hear me, right?  i had a boyfriend in 7th grade for about three days until he passed me a crumpled note in science class that read, "i think we should see other people."  "good, i was thinking the same thing," i wrote back, and the proceeded to call in sick the next few days.  i called in sick a lot in seventh grade, again for reasons i won't discuss.  i had ridiculous excuses.  once, i called in sick because the toilet had flooded, and i thought i should stay home to watch it.  i remember a cute boy flirting with me, which was unheard of, as i wasn't that cute myself.  that's a crystal clear memory; gee, i wonder why.  7th grade, i started reading v.c. andrew books, dog-earing all the dirty parts.  i didn't listen to a lot of music in 7th grade, as i didn't get my own c.d. player until 8th grade.  my very first c.d. was, of all things, meatloaf's "bat out of hell 2."  i still will argue that it was a fabulous c.d.  later, i would enjoy the cranberries, counting crows, bon jovi, and sheryl crow.  i had a friend who wasn't allowed to listen to sheryl crow because there was talk that she was a lesbian.  this friend of mine showed tendencies towards lesbianism herself; i always felt bad for her because i knew that there was no way she could tell her weird, ugly parents without having them pull out a gun on her.  i had two great english teachers in 7th grade, and they had such confidence in me.  i still have what one of them wrote in my yearbook, even though i threw the rest of the yearbook out.  "jackie, you will go far in this world.... you're an extremely talented writer and an asset to the world."  actually, instead of "world," she said, "class."  but i'm allowed to embellish, right?  i had a crush on the boy who lived behind me.  he was the son of a major league baseball player, and so my daydreams focused on him being a major league baseball player as well, and me being the wife of a major league baseball player.  i had a lot of excuses to go outside whenever he was outside, too.  i had to pet the dog.  i had to take out the trash, one item at a time.  i had to read on the deck or inspect the lawn.  i had to gaze adoringly in his direction, insane with the lust of a 12 year old.  thinking back, i sure did make a lot of stupid excuses.  also, i would position myself by the kitchen window with a pair of binoculars as to get a close-up.  i'm sure that wasn't incredibly obvious, me with window blinds up pressing binoculars against the glass while i crouched on the countertop and tried not to fall in the sink.  he probably heard my parents fighting all the time.  that's why he didn't ask me out- also, the unruly hair, short pants, and squinting.  i wore my first bra that a year, which was only necessary due to changing in gym class.  being a flat girl in a class full of busty barbies wasn't the best thing for my self-esteem; but, then again, let's once again recall that since my vision was so poor, i suppose i didn't notice all THAT much.  i wrote a lot of bad, junior high poetry, which was the prelude to my bad high school poetry.  i wanted to be a writer even then in seventh grade; i told people that i wanted to major in english or journalism.  i don't think i was quite sure what journalism was.  i also considered being a therapist or actress.  i did a lot of acting in front of the living room mirror, producing my own episodes of "clarissa explains it all," except, of course, that it was "jackie explains it all."  i didn't have all that much to explain.  i walked up and down stairs.  i sat next to kevin vahl in spanish class, and he'd crack me up every day.  i sat next to some other dude whose name i can't remember in computer class, and he too would crack me up every day.  this was only because he'd open the paint program and create completely pornographic images.  "oh, look," i'd say upon sitting down, "another vagina.  that's a nice one, too."  i wrote for the literary magazine that year, which is how i met my friend chrissy.  she wrote stories about italian boys and gave them last names like mazzola and crisco; i wrote a story about a girl getting killed by a volleyball.  i didn't much care for volleyball.  i wish i had a copy of that literary magazine; i can't remember what else i wrote.  i'm sure it was pulitzer worthy.

       turns out i have  several  callings in life.   this one is an eye for matchmaking.  sure, i've failed a few times in the past, but i'd like to think that i've always been close.  my latest coupling is gina and brian: gina, my favorite near-redhead (as opposed to rachel, my favorite redhead), and brian, chris' favorite... towhead.  i put them together because they have similiar body types.  this is key in any relationship.  beyond that, they're both scathingly sarcastic and fans of casual sex, alcohol, and other vices that i will choose not to mention on this here blog.  i knew what i was doing.  and i did such a good job.  i watched  urlLink "monk"  for the first time this morning.  very funny television series, but in a subtle as opposed to slapstick way.  as i said in my personal ad so many moons ago: slapstick is sexy; subtle is sexier.  too bad tony shalhoub isn't very sexy.  back to work tomorrow.  boo for me.  diana and i are supposed to alternate our weekends off from now on, but somehow i'm working the next two weekends.  huh.  pshh.

       well, we've pretty much decided where we're going to live in june should we stay in the chicagoland area.  walking through this place was like falling in love on the first date; i feel giddy just thinking about it.  it's a one bedroom, one and a half bath, with a separate den and wet bar area.  a wet bar!!  it's cool because you walk in and see just a dining room and living room and kitchen... but then you walk past the FIREPLACE and, bam, you turn into a den.  with a wet bar.  did i mention it has a den and wet bar?  also, the bedroom is gigantic with a vanity area (for the vain) and a big closet... for shoes.  so stay tuned, and be prepared to come to a kick ass party in hoffman estates come june or july.  we're going to have a wet bar, you know.  and we're painting the walls violet.

       mostly, i didn't like her because of what she was wearing.  it was basically a crocheted blanket with a hole in it for her head; it looked like her neck was wearing some kind of ridiculous skirt.  i don't understand how she could comfortably move her arms around under that thing- especially because one hand was weighed down with a diamond the size of jupiter.  she talked on about the benefits of using opti-free versus renu.  her slide show about tetronic 1304, an ingredient in the contact lens solution, went on for approximately four days.  it's a good thing she brought lunch; i occupied my mind by rearranging my sandwich into what looked like a snowman.  i used french fries to make the arms.  "what kind of solution do you use," she asked me.  i couldn't very well tell her,  whatever i can snag for free , so i responded, "renu.  i think i'm allergic to... technotronic 2000."  she's giving us one dollar- or 100 pennies- for every box of opti-free we sell.  she had selling tips, too.  "always touch the person you're talking to.  touch their hand, their shoulder.  use eye contact.  pretend you're talking to a friend."  i'm not touching anyone.  i'm pissed off because this woman in the sweater/blanket is leaving for a european vacation in about a week.  i want to go on a european vacation.  and a dollar a box just ain't going to cut it.

       last night was my first time closing the store by myself.  everything went fine until i tried to open the safe.  xx-yy-zz.  xx-yy-zz.  it wouldn't open.  i said the combo aloud like a kindergardener attempting to count apples.  xx.  yy.  zz.  no good.  i crouched there for 15 minutes trying to "jimmy" open the safe.  let's just say we have a quality safe.  "yeah, george?"  i said to the retail manager over the phone.  "you're not asleep, are you?  because everything here went swimmingly tonight except for the fact that i can't open the safe."  "who is this?"  george asked sleepily.  "jackie.  from work.  i can't open the safe."  "what are you, a fucking retard?"  at least, that's what i heard him say.  actually, he replied, "okay.  i'll be right over."  xx-yy-zz.  i thought of the movie  safe men.    urlLink ever see that?   maybe you should own it.  there's a character in the movie that wears butt pads, because he thinks his butt is too flat.  classic.    anyhow, back to my story.  i'm in the office trying to crack the safe.  xx-yy-zz.  let's do it slower.  xx.....yy.....zz.  no luck.  maybe if i do it backwards.  zz-yy-xx.  i've got a thousand dollars in cash lying on the floor beside me.  the whole store is dark.  george has not yet arrived, and i consider just taking the money home.  then i could maybe keep the money if i tell the general manager that, upon walking into the parking lot, i was robbed by a gang of vicious orphans.  with british accents.  xx-yy-zz.  fuck.  i exit the office, and there's george pounding on the front door.  "how long have you been here?"  i ask, letting him in.  "i thought you'd have a key."  "ten long minutes," he replies.  "i don't have my key."  we walk into the office.  george is in pajama pants; obviously, he had not been planning on having to help some dim-witted girl pop open a safe.  he smells vaguely of pizza.  i wonder why he didn't bring me any.  xx-yy-zz.  it opens.  i cry, "for the love of christ."  i'd been half hoping that somebody had accidently changed the combination during the day, as then i couldn't be faulted.  maybe vicious orphans could've snuck in here while i was in the crapper or something.  i start to mention something about oliver twist.  george says, "okay, let's go."  we leave.  i thank him profusely.  i get in my car, and, eager to get home, i slam on the accelerator and back out of my parking spot.  doing so, i nearly crash into george's car, which is pulling out behind me.  what a way to repay him.  i give a small wave and carefully drive away.  george is shaking his head.  i can't get a safe open, and today i'm going to a meeting on preventative opthalmic maintenance- as in taking care of the gadgets and machines the doctors and lab techs use.  i'm considering telling the guy in charge that i can't even open a safe... even when knowing the code... so how the hell am i going to check that a big fancy machine is tuned to correct diopter increments?  fuck, man.  at least i didn't hit george's car.

       well,  urlLink this game  is certainly addicting.     my weekend was rather lazy, except for saturday when i worked 10- 6.  that was pretty rough-going.  i can't stand working on saturdays, because that's when everybody and their mother (their old, crotchety, half deaf, i-want-a-deal mother) comes out.  saturdays make me hate my life.  saturdays make me cry.  saturdays make me a mean person; if you come into my store on a saturday with some real, genuine problem, i will not only have no empathy, but i will also glare at you the whole time you're telling your sad tale of eyewear woe.  saturday night we went out with chris' ex-boss, a man with a head full of completely white hair.  some people can really carry that off, such as steve martin.  and this guy.  yesterday we bummed around all day, except for a mid-day jaunt to quizno's and costco.  costco always gets me upset.  i always feel like i'm going to die before i can use the stuff i buy.  we bought a gigantic box of raisin bran, 12 light bulbs when all i needed was 1, and a drum full of chai mix.  we almost got the 30 rolls of toilet paper, but were afraid that we wouldn't have enough cash.  30 rolls of toilet paper- now that we would have used, especially since i'm starting to cook a little more.  watch out, guests.

       my new motto is going to be:   under my thumb:  stealing pictures off the internet, one website at a time.      this is bob werner, if you can read his nametag.  his last name is one letter away from being "wiener," if you change the r to an i and then transpose the e and the i.... anyways, i don't know anything about bob wiener, except that he is surely wearing shoulder pads.  he may be an artist of some sort, posing for this picture in front of his latest work, entitled, "study in black and white."  i think he's really going places.

       i just finished playing  urlLink "who wants to be a cotton millionaire?"   i ended up in debtor's prison.  figures.  i'm ready to move.  i don't like this apartment anymore.  when we get our new place, i'm going crazy on decorating.  i might tend towards the stupid.  chris will come home after work and ask, "what's with the giant mobile made of feathers, macaroni, toothpaste tubes, and styrofoam cups?  and why must you hang it right in front of the tv?"  "because," i'll snootily reply, "the place over the sofa was taken up by the three-dimensional time line of south african history."  the lawn in front of our apartment building is flooded due to all the rain.  i'm talking, i was knee-deep when i took out the trash.  weren't certain plagues caused because of poor drainage/sewage systems?  or maybe i'm thinking of something else.

        things i'm thinking about this morning as i put off working on my crappy story:   my mom was always pissed off that she was never able to become a mail carrier.  she mentions it a lot, and i just don't get it.  when i was in second grade, we colored pictures of dinosaurs.  the teacher said, "you can make them any color you want, because nobody really knows what color they were."  still, everybody made their dinosaurs either green or brown.  if i were that teacher, i would have flunked everybody.  music tends to make you remember different times in your life.  for me, it's socks.  the socks i'm wearing today make me think of my cousin getting married.  i also have a pair of socks that make me remember her subsequent divorce and another pair of socks that remind me of throwing out the bridesmaid dress i had to wear.  it was a really pretty dress; i didn't think i'd ever have a chance to wear it again, so i pitched it.  that was dumb.  i get a lot of paper cuts.  i always confuse the gordita with the chalupa.  i know i like one better than the other, but i still don't know which one is which.  it's like taco bell just throws these obscure words at you and expects you to remember what each one is.  they should call one, "the good one," and the other, "the okay one."  then i'd remember for sure.  i really want to live in an apartment with an in unit washer and dryer.  not only would it be convenient, but have you ever had sex on top of a washing machine?  you should.  but you can't do it if you have a communal laundry room, unless, of course, you're into that kind of thing.  i'm tired of saying hello to my neighbors all the time.  i don't know any of their names or anything else about them, and the hello is a fake pleasantry that i do not need in my life.  i have, however, made up names for them, and i also fear that if i keep saying hello all the time, i'm going to accidentally go too far.  "hello, gloria," i'll say to someone who is actually named joan.  "how's the lawsuit against the electric company coming along?  and, of course, the child pornography?"  maybe that will end the hellos.  i still don't know where my umbrella went.

       i need suggestions on which book to read next.  it has to be fiction.  it has to be available in paperback, because hardcover books make my tiny wrists ache.  i don't read translated literature; the only exception i ever made is "the stranger," and i still feel like i was somehow duped.  so i'm a manager now.  diana and i will take turns having weekends off.  while that's fair, i kind of want EVERY weekend off.  for what, i don't know.  it's not like i'm heading off to bed and breakfasts every saturday.  i wouldn't mind going to a bed and breakfast.  i'd like to go to one in some town with a lot of antique stores.  also, a town paper where a lot of headlines are horribly misspelled.

       i like this h.g. wells quote:   moral indignation is jealousy with a halo.   i like this quote from my dad:   never trust anybody who reads the bible in public.   and then i like this hodge-podge quote from me:   you can drag a dead and beaten gift-horse to water but you can't make it drink.   because, you know, it's dead.  i'm starting slowly with this cooking thing.  last night i bought pre-prepared stuffed salmon fillets and then threw them in the oven.  boy, were they tasty.  i heated them up just right, and i couldn't have been more proud of myself than if i had actually mixed the crab and shrimp and cheese stuffing all by myself.  "this cooking thing is a snap," i said aloud to no one in particular as i carefully twisted the oven knob to 375 degrees.  i did, however, sautee mushrooms all on my own.  those were especially yummy as well.  if only i had grown the mushrooms on my own.  but, as we know, i'm a chef, not a gardener.  it doesn't take much to make me feel like i've accomplished something.  still no word from microsoft.  every time i mention moving to somewhere else in this neighborhood once our lease expires in june, chris says, "hey, let's not get ahead of ourselves- we're moving to washington, remember?"  i keep seeing signs that seattle is in our future.  of course, that's because i've posted pictures of the space needle all up and down our hallway, over our bed, and in the shower.  i had to laminate the ones that are in the shower.  but now i'm getting off track.

       i am lazy, with ambitious dreams.  i quickly become upset, but can also be quickly cheered up.  one thing that will get me upset for sure is if you refer to me as "annoying."  "big fucking wierdo," i don't mind so much.  i'm good at making friends.  i used to be extremely shy, but then i discovered alcohol.  i want to live in seattle.  i don't fall in love easily, but, when it's right, i fall in love quickly.  it's only been right once.  the time before that, it *felt* right, but was actually as wrong as humanly possible.  i remember that when i started to know it was wrong was when we were eating breakfast, and he was wearing a sweatshirt with a huge picture of a dog on it.  he called me annoying a lot.  that's why i don't like to be called annoying now.  he also picked on me for being so lazy.  i like cats, but i don't really care for dogs.  i like silver better than gold.  if i could change one thing about myself, it would be my smile.  it's not that nice of a smile, and i used to cover my mouth when i laughed.  now i don't cover my mouth, because i'm older and "over it," but every once in a while i catch myself smiling in the mirror and have to immediately stop.  i have a fantastic butt.  sometimes i bend over in front of people on purpose.  i dislike spending time in nature.  i also dislike public pools, people in mini-vans, know-it-alls, and plain white socks.  i especially dislike elderly people with carts containing over 20 items in the "self-check out lane" at jewel.  i think there should be strict rules for the self-check out lane.  if you don't know how to work a remote control, you are not allowed to check yourself out.  if you are over 70, you need to get your ass in a regular line.  if you have more items than you can fit in your arms, get out of my fucking way because i only have yogurt and a can of pop and  i am in a goddamn hurry.   retards.  i like holding babies.  i don't like holding crying babies.  i like art museums.  i like book stores.  i don't like gun shows or looking at model trains.  my dad used to take us to civil war reenactments.  now there's a bunch of people with way too much time on their hands.  i think i have an ulcer.  what i miss most about college is the grilled cheese i used to eat for lunch.  my parents almost named me jeanette.  i am not a jeanette.  i love the name 'jaclyn.'  i wouldn't trade it for any other name, except maybe 'stumblebee.'

       last night, i watched  urlLink "my life without me,"  which is basically the kind of movie that nobody should watch alone, expecially if they're pre-menstrual.  i didn't time my crying, but it had to go on for at least fifty-six minutes.  this is a beautiful, sad, heartwrenching movie.  it recieves the jackie award for two kleenexes up.  soggy kleenexes, that is.  i have to take harriet in for an emissions test today.  harriet is my car.  she's lovable and scrappy, modest and dependable.  she likes the same music i do, and she doesn't mind stowing away my empty fast food bags and coffee cups.  she likes to go everywhere i like to go, shuddering only a little bit when i wear her out on certain days.  i know she's not going to be happy to go get her emissions tested.  "jackie," she'll say, "do you ever notice that all the people who work here.... are kind of scummy?"  "it's not so bad," i'll reassure her.  "if you're good, maybe i'll splurge for the mid-grade gas next week."  harriet is getting old.  they give her "special" oil now.  really, the special oil is the same crap as the regular oil, only it costs twenty bucks more.  harriet enjoys the illusion of luxury, though.  she says she wants to enter her retirement in style.  i'm afraid to tell her, though, that retirement won't be a gold watch and a condo in florida- it'll be the victory auto wreckers, where she'll be pillaged for parts and peed in by vagrants.  which is just as well, because, being a car, it would be difficult to write out the check for the condo.  never mind not having a wrist for the watch.

       i didn't sleep last night.  now i want to take a nap, but my mother always warned me:  if i sleep now, i won't sleep later.  this from a woman who sleeps all the time.  now, where does she get off?  have you guys seen that pop-up ad for the marines?  it basically says, "join the marines, and we'll give you an ipod."  then you see two kids in capri pants dancing it up to the music that their ipods are presumably cranking out.  what i want to see is these kids in uniform, overseas, scared shitless because an assload of suicide bombers are making their way up the street-  in something turbo-powered.  "where are your precious ipods now?" i'd shout at them.  if you join the marines because of the free ipod, you're a goddamn idiot. although, i will admit, once i almost joined the army for a duffel bag.  this was a duffel bag that could have fit ten, twelve heads of cabbage easy.  did you know that koalas often get chlamydia?  oh what to do,  oh, what to do.

          you should read "the last man" graphic novel series.  yes, you.  it's funny, it's thought provoking, and one of the characters is a helper monkey.  how many more reasons do you need?  plus, one of the lines is, "i've been eating so many canned peaches that i think i shat a cobbler."  reading that sentence made me want to dance.  the delight that filled me was too much to contain, and i nearly toppled over.  i'm tired of dreaming about high school.  i do it too much, but it's never quite the  urlLink high school that i remember .  true, it's still roughly the same building, with roughly the same people, but last night, for instance, i was commuting from arlington heights to go to school in tinley park.  i still didn't have my high school degree.  i never do, and i'm always over 20.  what does the internet have to say about dreams like this?   Dreaming that you have to repeat high school, suggests that you are doubting your accomplishments and the goals that you have already completed. You feel that you may not be measuring up to the expectation of others. The dream may occur because some recent situation may have awakened old anxieties and insecurities.    great.  but it's hard to doubt accomplishments when they're few and far between.  also, i know i don't measure up to the expectations of others.  i could be a better girlfriend, manager, writer, friend, daughter.  but i'm not.  this dream description mentions naught of being lazy.   Classic dream figures, drawn from the edge of our adolescent circle of friends, are likely to be symbols of aspects of our personality which we first became aware of when we projected them onto these same people back in high school. When these faces show up in our dreams, it means that these same aspects of our own character are resurfacing, and now wear the masks of these old acquaintances for purposes of recognition. Whatever we thought about those people when we knew them, is what we think about these emerging parts of our own psyche now.   i never dream of friends from high school, just people- mostly guys, ahem- that i barely knew.  maybe i assigned characteristics to these people that i now have?  that's odd, though- i've not once held a football.  there's something in me that fears the progress i've made since high school.  i used to be shy and quiet and overly self-conscience.  i didn't ever think life would be kind to me, or that anyone would see me as pretty or funny or smart; i was convinced that i'd grow into nothing and live with 400 cats and have to get money from the government since i'd have no possible way of supporting myself.  i always saw myself in a floral dress with wild, grey hair and a face filled with so many wrinkles that if a drop of rain were to fall on my forehead, it would just spiral down for hours until it finally reached my neck.  mind you, i imagined myself as only 30.  now that i've become a person that i like, now that i know that i'm lovable and can do things i didn't think i could ever do (while still maintaining the element of lazy)- i don't think i entirely know how to deal.  when will i ever know?  these dreams do not occur just once in a while; they are almost serial, definitely recurring.  perhaps i've shared too much.  blast it.

       dear editor,  i don't necessarily agree with your stand on that one certain issue.  nonetheless, i am willing to overlook our differences if you will simply publish this letter.  i don't have anything of importance or relevance to say; i just want my name in print.  who am i, you ask?  i'm the part-time wallflower avoiding eye contact in crowds.  i'm the browser that doesn't buy.  i'm the girl who speaks of big dreams but then goes home to make a sandwich and spend the evening watching four hours of "full house" reruns.  i wanted to volunteer to read to the blind, but only so i could change the endings to stories.  "and then cinderella got run over by a gubernatorial candidate driving a greyhound bus."  i would always use the word "gubernatorial," because i like the way it sounds.    i'm not a mean person, but i often envision my enemies getting crushed by randomly falling grand pianos.  i took a vocational test once, and it told me that i should become a gardener.  not that i have anything against flowers, don't get me wrong- but, well, i could never be a gardener.  first of all, i really don't like mud.  it gets beneath my fingernails, like mustard or pizza sauce.  only not as tasty.  second of all, i don't have the best track record when it come to taking care of plants.  i left a potted family of, let's say peonies, outside during a rainstorm.  they washed away.  thirdly, you always see gardeners wearing sun hats or bonnets.  i don't think either would be flattering on me.  is it wrong for me to think that the quality of my life will improve once i move into a different apartment?  that's what you can do, editor- riddle me that.  jackie

       friday, the cheese and i hung out with my friend john and his wife kirstin.  we went to the restaurant bahama breeze, which is caribbean food brought to us by the same good people that gave us the olive garden, red lobster, and  urlLink mercury in our seafood.    i feel like i want to set john and dan up- not for any kind of romantic relationship, of course, but to be friends.  i want john to say:  "jackie?  yeah, i met her through dan!"  they are both artists working in less than satisfying jobs.  although john knows more about bifocals.  last night, chris and i drank a bottle of wine at our favorite french bistro, and then proceeded to open a charge account at a furniture store and buy a lot of furniture.  not a whole lot, mind you- just seven items.  i'm sure they'll all look great in our new place, which is about a block away from the bar we ended up at later.  the karaoke dj announce that it was time for the electric slide, and chris promptly jumped up and proclaimed, "okay, we're leaving."  today i worked all day, battling the forces of good, evil, and taxation without representation.  well, mostly just evil.  and now we're off to houlihans, which advertises "amazingly timeless food and drink."  what's the difference between timeless and stale?  maybe dan and the redhead will know.

       i'm looking at time magazine's  urlLink 100 most influential people .  aside from the obvious problem of why i'm not listed, i also noticed that they grouped people into the following categories:  builders and titans heroes and icons leaders and revolutionaries artists and entertainers scientist and thinkers  alright.  so there are no builders and thinkers?  no leaders and artists?  what about scientists and entertainers?  how come there's nobody out there who mixes an acid and a base and then does a song and dance about it?  also, i'm very curious about how nicole kidman got on that list.  she's influenced me to puke a few times, but, friends, does that really count?  i came across this list of the  urlLink 25 most influential people in real estate .  interesting to note that the two lists have not one name in common.  maybe if cnn had added "brokers and closers" to their list?  we'll never know.

          from the country that brought us "iron chef" and the bento box, mitsubishi motors and  urlLink yokoi shoichi , sumo wrestling and hello kitty, japan presents:  wario world.  of course, it's been out for a while.  but my love affair with wario world has just begun, and i feel like a giddy school girl on the day of homecoming.  oh, what will become of this exciting new relationship?  will wario (who, i just found out, has a brother named  waluigi ) and i become a permanent item?  will i be able to convince my friends that his zig-zag mustache and habit of yelling out "have a rotten day!" are all part of the appeal?  or will our love affair die like the sucker punched  magons  in level one?  part of my aching heart fears it's inevitable; i have to return the game to blockbuster on monday morning.  then what happens?  will wario call?  will he write?  i just don't know.

       i get the safe open, no problem.  i set the alarm and try to get the hell out of there.  the only problem is that my thumb is sore from all the nintendo i've been playing lately.  attempting to turn the key with a swollen thumb is like trying to pull the sword from the stone.  it takes me forever to finally get the door securely shut.  i walk to my car and think, "that went well."  i begin to drive away.  suddenly, i ask myself, "what's that siren noise?"  i look in my rearview mirror and see that a bunch of little red and blue lights that i didn't even know my store was equipped with are flashing out of control.   shit.   the goddamn alarm is waking up the entire northwest suburbs.  i slam my car into park and race to the door, my nintendo thumb aching as i desperately try to unlock the door.  all around me, lights are flashing and sirens are blaring.  inside the phone is ringing.  i punch the code into the alarm's key pad and then answer the telephone, still remembering to use the phone script.  i even ask if they want to schedule an eye exam.  "this is the security dude," says the security dude, "what the hell's going on?"  my heart is pounding.  "i have nintendo thumb," i blurt.  "i mean... i set the alarm... off... instead of giving us thirty seconds to get the door locked, i really think you people should allow, like, ten minutes.  fifteen, even."  sigh.  yet another thing i have to explain to my manager, on top of why i used his toothbrush to clean the floor tiles.  but who keeps their toothbrush at work?

       at my aunt's 50th birthday party, we played a game where we all had to write down a memorable moment involving my aunt.  she was to guess who had written it.  "i've got my memorable moment," chris proclaimed, scrawling on a sheet of paper, " there's an open bar, and you're welcome to drink, but don't drink too much if you're driving ."  my aunt had repeated this four or five times upon our arrival to the restaurant.  his was the first memorable moment pulled, and my aunt immediately guessed, "chris?"    my mom's family always plays games like this, and my aunt rita always organizes them.  i wonder if me and my sister will be like this one day, at our own sure-to-be-pitiful family parties.  " my memorable moment with marcia ," i will write on a sheet of paper, " is when we swore we'd never do this.  and yet here we are.  here we are ."  my mom played her guitar.  surely, she had rehearsed for the past three weeks, no less than four hours per day.  my younger cousins each said something into the microphone.  "i'm having fun at aunt barb's fiftieth birthday," corey said.  "i can't wait until she turns sixty."  we almost bought a table set today, but we're both somewhat cheap.  we almost bought a coffee table, but it was out of stock.  we purchased a lamp after dropping it.  looking at each other, we said, "i'm sure it's fine."  if we wanted to get another one, we'd have to go up two sets of escalators.  that was not going to happen.  we're going to memphis soon.  i can finish off that roll of film that i started in virginia four months ago.

       my sister and her boyfriend of three years have allegedly broken up.  actually, my sister's just assuming they've broken up, as they got into a huge fight and now he's completely avoiding her and having his friends lie to her as to his whereabouts.  she's also certain that he cheated on her.  which makes me think:  how could we all have been so wrong about him?  it's funny; last week, i would have said, "my sister's boyfriend? he's great! they're perfect together!"  today i say, "if i see the goddamn asshole, i'm going to run him down.  him and his dog."  which i say despite knowing nothing about his pet status.  i feel awful for my sister, because she's the most beautiful, funny, and sweet girl in the entire world.  she should never have to deal with heartache.  other girls, they can deal with heartache.  the olsen twins, for instance.  they deserve a little heartache.  why?  well, why not?

        urlLink this  is a great website.   watch  urlLink episodes.   i have to write quarterly reviews for my associates at work today.  the key is to include something positive for everything negative.  "katie is horrendously rude to customers.  she does, however, always smell nice.  she is consistently late to work.  i really liked that sweater she wore today.  an opportunity for katie would be to work on her sales goals.  katie has all of her teeth."  i also have to create the upcoming schedule.  that's always fun.  "jackie, it appears you've scheduled yourself '1:30 to 3:30' everyday."  work stresses me out a little.  i've never had specific things to do before; i just kind of walked in and hung out for a few hours.  now i'm writing reviews, making schedules, and yesterday i trained one of the managers for another store.  a lot of my training went like this:  "they say you're suppose to do this, but i never do it.... here's another thing that's kind of important, but i don't do that either.... you won't have to worry about this because if somebody asks you about it, you can always just make up something."  i'm due for a promotion any day now.

          i went to school in canada, living in a beautiful old home as opposed to just a dormitory.  the subjects i studied were varied, but forgettable.  what i do remember is the kinds of things i did in my beautiful old home.  i made the bed neatly, tucking in the corners of the sheets.  i created tasty dinners in the sunny, oversized kitchen.  i pounded away at my typewriter in the den, working on my memoirs.  i had the dean of students over for tea.  "i'd like to attend this school again next semester," i told him, "and, of course, stay in this house."  the dean of students looked strangely like dean cain.  in my head, i called him "the dean of students cain."  he didn't like my tea; i noticed him pouring it out behind the sofa when i turned to butter a croissant.  "why do you really want to stay here?"  he asked.  "it's certainly not the education you're receiving."  true.  in fact, i should have been in class at that moment.  intro to... something or other... 101.  i shrugged, and  he continued, "you could find a house like this in america, you know."  i feared that he lied.  "but how can you be so sure?"  i asked.  "and how will i move the stove?  it's heavy as sin."  "that stove belongs to the owners of this house," he said uncomfortably.  "you're just a renter."  then the dean of students cain asked, "and why aren't you wearing any pants?"  i looked down, saw my bare thighs, and quickly grew embarrassed.

        Easter Facts    In 1953, it took 27 hours to create a Marshmallow Peep. Today it takes six minutes.    Why... what... when... why would you bother?  Twenty-seven hours seems a bit extreme.  If I buy a frozen pizza and I have to leave it in the oven longer than 20  minutes , I'm pissed.  I can't imagine working at that factory and taking over a  day  to create a  peep .   In Norway, reading detective novels and crime thrillers has become a popular Easter pastime.    Okayyyyy.  Let me try to bend my head around this one.... I can't.  That's all the Easter Facts I have for now.  _______________________________________  I'm not a fan of holidays.  There's too much pressure on holidays to be sociable.  On holidays, it's hard to go to the mall.  And then there's the whole dressing up bit.  Unless I'm going to work, I want to wear jeans.  I don't care if it is Easter or Christmas or Thanksgiving.  I want to wear jeans.  Period.  Last night, I ate non-imitation lobster for the very first time.  It tasted a lot like the imitation lobster, only there was that cumbersome shell to deal with.  I didn't get to pick my lobster out of a tank; I did, however, get to go dig up which potato I wanted.  Interesting restaurant, that one was.

       first, read  urlLink this five part essay on buying viagra online.     then, read the rest of my blog entry.  i got chastised yesterday at work because my clothes were baggy and unironed.  wrinkled, if you will.  i don't know what i was thinking yesterday morning when i got dressed.  it reminded me of the one time when i went to work in a  sweatshirt .  i got sent home that day, which was fine because i think that's what i was subconsciously aiming for.  i remember feeling more mental than usual that afternoon.  now, i wasn't mental yesterday, but i still went to work looking like i'd just taken my pants and shirts (i had layered two mismatched colors, see) out from the bottom of the hamper.  the doctor told me a  patient made a comment about it.  i wonder if that same patient made a comment about my shoes:  "it looks like she wore out the leather in the front and then just colored in the worn parts with a black marker.... and then that black marker turned blue... who colors their shoes, anyways?"  today i think i look okay.  my blacks don't match, though.  they seldom do.  my black pants are a nice shade of black, but my black shirt is more of a "jackie black," as in, it's a little faded and almost looks navy.  much like the colored marker on yesterday's shoes.  see, i'm tying it all together.  getting dressed can be a bitch.

       i think my parents traded our in first home- a two story dump- for our second home- a one story dump- partially because i had a habit of falling down the stairs.  a lot.  i fell down the stairs going from my bedroom to the living room on a semi-daily basis.  i think i was just always in a big hurry to get from my bedroom, where there was no tv or bologna, to the downstairs, where there was a lot of tv and bologna, and i rarely watched where i was going.  thus, i did a lot of tumbling.  i also walked into walls a lot at our first house, mainly the wall right by the stairs.  i ceased to worry my parents because they just got used to hearing my random "thuds" either at the base of the stairs or against that one particular wall.  they'd hear a "thud" and roll their eyes, saying, "there she goes again."  "i think i really hurt my brain," i told them once, upset because they didn't seem to care that i kept walking into walls.  my dad held up a seagram's 7 bottle.  "what's the number on this bottle?"  he asked.  "can you see it clearly?"  this would help him with his prognosis of whether or not i was fine.  i exaggerated my squinting.  "it's a 'Q,'" i proclaimed.  "and, who are you again?"  "you're fine, go play," he said.  pouting, i purposefully walked into the wall once more, and then, on accident, managed to fall *up* the stairs.  "now that," my dad said to my mother, "is at least something new."

        urlLink this blew my mind.   urlLink  then this continued to blow my mind.   my mind is blown.  a line to get tickets for the art museum snaked outside and down the steps.  if we had waited in line, we would have waited for at least half an hour.  we stood in the lobby wondering if it was worth it, watching as the line slowly crawled forward.  "we could do something else," i suggested.  "or we could just try to walk in," dan countered.  he slipped past the security guard first.  then i did, afraid to look behind me as i strode confidently forward.  i didn't think chris would make it,  but he did.  the three of us had just thwarted the security guard at the art institute.  don't you chicagoans feel safe to know that i could have walked in with a bomb in my purse and nobody would have stopped me?  also, how nice to not pay on a non-tuesday.  not that my "suggested donation" would have added much to their pockets.  i think they recommend you pay ten bucks.  i may have thrown them ten cents.  this is because, although i support the arts, i am a horribly cheap bastard.  plus i'm still trying to pay off this lap top.  one year later, and i've still only paid about 1/4 of what i owe.  fuckers.

       i need a library card.  i need to go to the library.  my dad took me to the library once and said, "you can only pick out two books."  knowing two books would only last me two days, i first whined about his rule and then proceeded to pick out the two thickest books i could find.  i'm not sure, but i think i may have checked out the king james bible.  what kind of father *limits* the amount of reading his daughter can do?  maybe if he'd have let me have three books, i would have gone to harvard.  my mother used to take me to book sales at the library.  they'd have a deal:  all the books you can fit in a brown paper bag for five bucks.  she had an art to arranging books as to maximize the space.  by the time we were done packing books into that paper bag, it weighed approximately the same as an adult human being.  there were always stickers in the children's books:  please wash your hands before reading!  sometimes i'd smear peanut butter onto one of the pages just to be a bitch.  how dare they order me to wash my hands!  what kind of slob did they think i was?  and if i was out of peanut butter:  red sauce.

       what does it mean when you dream about cars?  when you dream that your car, driven by a girl who looks just like you, flies off a bridge and crashes into a building?  what does that mean, anyways?  or when you dream about being in your car, getting lost, and driving to see your boyfriend, who for some reason lives three hours away?  and he calls you and tells you to "forget it and just go home?"  but you're already too lost?  and your car is threatening to overheat?  what does it all mean?  what does it mean when you dream you're driving but then suddenly realize that your terribly myopic eyes are currently not fitted with their prescription contact lenses?  and you're going too fast to stop right away, and since everything is a blur, you don't see the school children that you hit, rather you just kind of feel them?  what does it mean that once you get out of your car, the ground suddenly turns to sea?  there are just floating stepping stones here and there that you can kind of hop to and from on?  the water is ice cold, and if you miss a stepping stone, you know you're fucked?  you get back in your car and get on the highway.  what does it mean when the highway twists and turns and loop-de-loops like a racetrack for a matchbox car?  and when you drive past the building that the girl who looks like you crashed into, you can still see a red stain exactly where she hit?  what, i'm asking, does that red stain signify?  and why does your car smell like fast food-  even in your dreams?

       and, we're in.  tuesday was the moving day from hell, although i guess i don't have much to complain about because the lifting and carrying i did was minimal.  the boys take a couch, jackie takes a box of socks.  the boys haul in an entertainment center, jackie drags a single bedside lamp, first unscrewing the light bulb as to make it weigh less.  the boys say, "it's not so bad," and jackie cries, "my fingers, they're a-fallin' off!"  she trades in the boxes of socks for something lighter, like a bag of milk duds, half empty.  the place is great, so far.  i thought i smelled leaking gas one night, but when i lit a match, nothing happened, so i suppose it's fine.  the cable guy came this morning with his big spool of wire.  the apartment people dropped off a newsletter the other day.  wednesdays are yoga classes.  saturday is tennis.  sunday is the giganto yard sale.  thursday, there's a cooking class.  i feel like i'm in a retirement complex.  now, i like the idea of these activities that they plan, but i really can't see myself jaunting down to the clubhouse with a bath towel, proclaiming myself ready to do some yoga with my neighbors.  as for the yard sale, though, i am completely prepared to purchase some of my neighbor's junk.  maybe one of them has an atari system.  or a pizza cutter.  or an ancient artifact worth millions.  and i'll pay them only a dime for it and then end up having enough money to buy illinois so i can sell it to, like, oregon or something.  definitely cannot see myself going to the cooking class.  i liken it to an armless man showing up for a clapping contest.  there are basic skills you have to acquire first.  if you get confused making a hot dog, you can't go to learn how to make texas chili.  if constructing a sandwich takes up your entire afternoon, you're not ready to prepare linguine with clam sauce.  all in all, everything seems too good to be true.  my mother is also fine; they're still not sure if what they removed was cancerous or not, but even if it was, she may have to go through a little chemo, but otherwise she'll be fine.  it's amazing how going through chemo these days is kind of casual.  i've known so many people who've done chemo treatments, meeting most of them this past half year.  they say, "i'm going for chemo" like i would say "i'm going for a poop."  which i do say fairly often.

       we're moving tomorrow.  we're putting all of our stuff into boxes and then taking all of our stuff out of boxes.  we're pulling drawers out of dressers only to put them back into dressers.  we're taking food out of one freezer and putting it into another.  this seems really silly to me; when are they going to perfect teletransportation?  i get stressed easily.  it's in my genes, like my unheard of metabolism and penchant for steely dan albums.  i lay awake last night thinking, "how am i going to move my jar of pennies without losing a few pennies or breaking the whole jar?  what if my hand falls off while i'm carrying something heavy?  what t-shirt should i wear?"  i started breathing erratically.  my heart banged like a toyota speeding through a series of gongs.  i grew upset about the prospect of buying a microwave.  i wondered how i would survive for four days without cable or the internet.  i thought, what if i forget my alarm clock and then have to buy a rooster or something?  nighttime is not my most sensible time.  today i'm going to most likely get a promotion.  this would be a sizely promotion, taking me from a decent hourly wage to a hefty salary.  they don't just hand out these salaries like condoms at a health fair, though.  they expect you to take on more responsibility.  they expect you to produce certain numbers and goals, shitting these accomplishments out as if you've just had a combination platter of coffee, bran, and ex-lax.  oh, my.  with all these new expectations, will i get any sleep at all?  so we've got the moving that i'm stressed about, my job, and last, but certainly not least, my mother.  she's having a biopsy today, surgery on her boobs.  there's a chance it's breast cancer, the doctors say, and my mother is scared witless.  on the phone, she talked like she was already gone.  "i know you and i have never been close, but..."  but what?  you'll be fine.  you'll have to be.  i couldn't handle it if you weren't.  and that's all i can say about that.

       since i began my quest to recieve an honorary degree, i have, as of late, not recieved an honorary degree.  jon stewart got an honorary degree.  alice cooper just got an honorary degree.  bill cosby, ditto.  even the president of costco got an honorary degree.  they're handing these suckers out like american flags after 9-11, and yet here i am, empty-handed and heavy of heart.  i must be more diligent about achieving my honorary degree.  the key, i know, is to first get nominated.  while doing some research in between cheesey puffs tonight, i discovered a list of guidelines given by the university of manitoba, located in beautiful winnipeg where the people are cold and the weather is friendly.  so, if anybody does want to submit me for this prestigious non-accomplishment, allow me to direct you to that webpage.   urlLink here it is.   don't dilly-dally over this; i'm getting antsy.  i don't have a speech prepared yet, but the words "i just flew in from illinois, and boy are my arms tired!" keeps creeping into my mind.  also, "but seriously, folks, what, exactly, is a doctorate anyways?"  they're probably going to want me to discuss my "field" while i'm up there.  "having the expertise in the expert field that i consider myself an expert in, i find that the grocery store lines are still  just as long as ever ."  anyhow, if the president of costco can get one, so can i.  has anybody ever shopped at costco?  it's a nightmare.  we've been through this, folks.  i just don't find a 15 gallon jug of laundry detergent very practical.  sigh.  an honorary degree just seems so ideal.  than i can go from being overly educated for my job to being  way  overly educated for my job- and a tad big-headed as well.   yes, jackie, for the millionth time, we know about your honorary degree from manitoba.  you can stop wearing that sandwich board now.

       so i took half a sick day today due to being half sick.  i'm going to work later on to close up the store, but the rest of the day is mine, all mine.  now that i've got the vomiting out of my system, i'm wondering what to do with myself next.  it's amazing how invigorating a good session of vomiting can feel.  we're moving in five days.  i step outside to get the mail after dabbing the puke from the chin and notice there's a man poking around outside the apartment next to ours.  i say hello, and he says, "how do you like living here?"  "why?" i ask.  "are you thinking of renting out this apartment?"  he affirms my suspicions, and i immediately launch into the diatribe that i have been saving for a situation such as this, after i calm down from hearing that, for the same apartment, his rent would be a full five hundred dollars a month less than mine.  five hundred dollars less!!  what kind of bullshit is that?  i tell him how living on the first floor makes you feel like the ceilings above are going to crash down on your head whenever you hear the thunder of the people upstairs walking around.  i tell him how the promises that management makes are lies, all lies!  i tell him about if your neighbors get roaches, you're guaranteed to get roaches.  i tell him the furnace breaks fortnightly, how the leasing agent has a large quantity of screws loose, how they won't clean your carpets before you move in, and did i mention how the ceilings might as well be made of paper?  they say you can move in one day, and then they call you the night before to say, "yeah, the apartment's not ready yet."  i go on about how horrible it is to do your laundry in a separate laundry facility, stressing how much it sucks in the winter, and i tell him how you get two guest parking passes, and that's it, and how if you have more than two visitors, those extra visitors are getting their asses towed, no two ways about it.  he looks upset.  he asks, "how's the neighborhood?  are the cops out here a lot?"  and i answer, honestly, "well, they were here last night.  and monday, too."  this man, this father of two, is visibly shaken.  "i don't think i'm going to be renting here," he says, clasping my hand.  "thank you so much for your input."  "all in a day's work," i tell him, proud of myself for helping to bring down this complex.  then i come inside and watch as this broken man slumps back to his car, head hanging sadly like a sack of potatoes strung from a twig.  anyhow, i'm sick.  can't figure out what it is.  maybe watching some daytime tv will help me put it all in perspective.

       on 2/8/2004, i wrote:   i met my back twin.  from the back, she looked exactly like me with her curly, chin length hair, her thin frame, and her clothes that mirrored something i would wear- an orange hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and funky running shoes.  val noticed her first, asking chris, "you do remember where we're sitting right?" for fear that he'd go join my back twin's table on his way back from the restroom.  we decided that i needed a picture with my back twin; i scooted my chair a little closer to her table and tried to sit near her without her noticing as chris snapped a picture of our backsides.  i walked around her table a few times, real casual-like, to get a look at her face, but she was definitely not my front twin with her pale, birdlike face and emerald-colored eyes.  i got jen and nikki to walk with me, jen snapping another picture as we passed her backside, and all of us staring at her front side rather obviously as to continue the comparing.  "you have to approach her," everyone agreed, and finally i got val to go with and do the talking.  we headed over to my back twin's table and val leaned in and said, "i'm sorry to bother you, but from the back, you look like my friend jackie."  as she said that, i turned around to reveal my backside as if to say, "yeah?  yeah?  you see it, right?  isn't this great?"  i turned around again.  my back twin was giving us a look as if to say, "alright, you creepy assholes, go back to wherever you came from."  we quickly excused ourselves.  i was a little sad that our conversation didn't last longer;  i wanted to ask, all wide-eyed and hopeful, "is your name jackie, too?"  but seeing my back twin was one of my happiest moments ever, period.   tonight, i saw my back twin again.  i was at a restaurant with gail, who had arrived at the restaurant first.  she had told a waitress, "i'm meeting my friend.  she looks a lot like you, actually- same hair and height and stuff."  i ended up finding the table without the help of this particular waitress, but gail mentioned this girl to me as we sat and ate.  later, my head nearly fell off its neck as i caught glimpse of the waitress that gail had spoken to.  it was the same girl from february, my back twin!  i had found her again!  i started to concoct a plan.  i fluffed my hair and tried to make eye contact with my elusive back twin, who appeared to be avoiding us.  "i need to talk to her," i told gail, desperation ringing in my voice.  gail strongly discouraged such action.  finally, after following my back twin around the restaurant under the guise of looking for the bathroom, i gave up... for the time being.  but the main point of this story?  i now know where my back twin works.  soon, i will know where she lives, what her hobbies are, and whether or not she wants to start hanging out.

        urlLink how to make babies.   you have to read odd news stories in order to make small talk with virtual strangers.  otherwise, you're stuck in that elevator attempting to discuss the weather.  and while the weather can be interesting and wacky, such as when it doesn't rain water but chocolate milk and raisinettes, most of the time, it's rather dull.  so what do you have to talk about without exposing the risk of having to bare personal details about your very private, boring life?  that screwball world out there!  "hey, speaking of being stuck in an elevator, have you heard about that  urlLink thousand dollar omelet ?"  "no, but did you hear about the  urlLink vaseline guy ?"  i suppose after a while it would be okay to discuss your personal life, like after a couple of days have gone by and the two of you are trying to subsist on the cloth of your jackets.  but even then, you have to exaggerate a little, for showmanship, for the art of fine fiction.  instead of saying, "my husband works in real estate," you say, "my husband owns all of colorado, and he's going to turn the whole dang state into a giganto farm where he can crossbreed chickens and cows, as to create the perfect meat."  really, the important thing is to not put your elevator partner to sleep, unless of course you're planning to attack and eat him out of desperation.  remember:  no one wants to hear about your pets, unless they've maimed something.  nobody cares what you think about congress or why you don't wear fur- unless, of course, you've slept with a congressperson or are wearing the fur of some famous cartoon animal, like scooby.  so- well, i would just stick to the wacky news stories.  and it's best to check them daily.

       while looking in the mirror, i made a startling discovery.  it's not so much a "discovery" as a "re-enlightenment of something that i've always known but tend not to think about."  i have a crooked smile; when i grin, one side of my mouth slants upwards more than the other half.  which is fine, that i can deal with.  that, my friends, is endearing.  but what i can't deal with is that even when my mouth is closed, it's still crooked.  it's like my maker just pasted on my lips without paying attention to the rest of my face.  i have a permanent sneer.  i am asymmetrical.  which i always knew, of course.  one boob is slightly bigger.  i think one leg is slightly longer (i could be making that up).  one eyebrow arches higher.  one side of my hair curls more than the other.  god, i'm a freakin' mess over here.  but the crooked mouth.  i stood in front of the mirror and tried to rearrange my face using only my hands.  no vices were available at the time.  i tugged upwards at one side of my face and pushed down the other side.  it looked okay, but then i had to let go.  bam, it sprang back into crookedsville.  this is when i started to hyperventilate.  it's okay now.  it's livable.  upsetting, but, hey, it's not like people stare at me like i have a third arm, right?  nobody even notices, i'm sure!  but- and here's where i have to lay down- what if it get worse with age?  what if my face twists and turns a little bit more every year until one day i'm 43, and my mouth is completely parallel to my nose?  gak!  then, when i try to physically- without using my hands- maneuver my mouth muscles to tip up the side of my mouth that doesn't go up, it's impossible.  i feel like a stroke victim- moreso than usual- and i'm not happy about it.  but, like i said, right now, it's okay.  but, god help me, what does the future hold for slanty mcslants-a-lot and her crooked mouth?  i hope it's cheesecake.

       we did a surprisingly good job at painting the new apartment, with the help of baby boy berger.  we have a purple wall.  we have a greyish blue wall.  we have a yellow wall.  and while it may sound to you like i'm describing the inside of a kindergarten, please note that we did  not  paste the alphabet on the wall.  we did not glue on numbers or popular animals.  and,  yes , it looks extremely awesome.  makes me want to throw a dinner party.    i had qualms about painting.  major concerns included:  paint spills, tired arms, ruined clothing, sloppy trim jobs, death by accidentally drinking from the paint can instead of a pepsi can, sitting in a tray of paint and then proceeding to sit down on the carpet (which would leave a butt-print on the floor, or a series of butt-prints if we kept moving), and opening the paint cans and finding out that they're filled with rattlesnakes, not paint.  but, alas, all went well.  we're very excited about this new place.  upon leaving, chris said, "grab my gatorade.  it's by the bar."  i responded, "which bar?" which made us both giddy since  we now have a plural amount of bars.     you got your wet bar, you got your breakfast bar.... and, yeah, well, that's it.  but two bars is pretty good, for a baby.  in other news, i bought the sunday chicago tribune.  such a massive paper, it is.  you need a wheelbarrel just to get it home.  so after i returned the wheelbarrel to my neighbor, linda, i started to weed out the sections i'm not going to read.  and then i realized:  it ain't such a big paper after all.  ah, that mother goose and grimm gets me every time.

       yesterday as i was leaving work, it was raining so hard that i thought i'd have to swim to my car.  i was going to resign myself to getting soaked and just make a mad dash out to the old girl when erica, another old girl, says to me, "let's make a poncho for you out of a garbage bag."  what a fantastic idea!  so i get an oversized garbage bag and put it on over my head.  it's so huge that it covers my entire body, just leaving my feet exposed at the bottom.  i look like casper the friendly ghost, only more retarded.  erica rips holes out for my eyes.  she asks, "do you want holes for your arms?"  i say, "no, because then my arms will get wet."  what's the point of wearing a garbage bag only to have your arms get soaked?  i can barely see out of the holes; they keep shifting.  i'm eager to get home, though, so i hurry out the front door into the rain.  i'm a human garbage bag, without arms, racing through a storm.  a car beeps at me.  i go to raise my hands to it, but then since i have no holes for my arms, the whole garbage bag moves, and suddenly the eye holes are nowhere near close to my actual eyes.  i can feel my ear getting wet.  undaunted, i keep moving.  i can kind of see out through the opaque-ish plastic, and i keep spinning the bag around my body until finally the holes are lined up again.  by this time, i am at my car.  i manage to open the door despite having rendered myself armless, and when i am in the car, i note that, except for that one ear, i am completely dry.  the bag, however, is slick with water, and my car seats are soon drenched.  i sit there for a moment, then make arm holes in the bag and proceed to drive home, still wearing the bag.  well, i'm kidding about that last part.  i slipped out of the bag and pulled out of my parking spot.  this, however, is true:  ten seconds later, it stopped raining completely.  here i was wearing a trash bag when all i had to do was wait 1/6 of a minute.  hey, how was i to know?

       we're at the karaoke bar when we see this big black man enter the room with a group of about seven old, white ladies in tow.  the man looks like a tele-evangelist leading his wrinkly flock through an ever parting red sea.  he's wearing a jacket and tie, and his smile is wide enough and bright enough to light up the entire metropolitan area. he calls himself 'the bear,' and while he looks nothing like bedtime bear or the berenstein bears or yogi bear or even yogi berra, there's something kind of cuddly, yet frighteningly mammalian about him.  the old ladies are a sad group, shuffling after 'the bear' with somewhat bewildered looks marking their dried up faces.  they're dressed up, too.  one woman wears a big flowery dress topped off with a pink blazer.  they all order soft drinks, some of the women discreetly swallowing horse pills with their soda pops.  the bear is a happy man with all these followers.  "we're here to have fun," he heartily reminds them, and a few weakly clap their hands together.  i turn to chris and ask, "what the hell is going on here?"  he's gotta be an evangelist; there's no other way.  my eyes are locked on this group; i know it's impolite to stare, but that's what i'm doing until i get some answers.  the bear goes up to sing.  he works the crowd, saying, "this song is for you... and you... and you... and you... and how could i forget agnes?"  he sings manilow's "copacabana (at the copa)."  he has the song looped a few times so that he can sing the verses over and over again while adding different names.  chris foresees the next verse our evangelist might sing:   "her name was agnes, she had a simple life, but now she gives me all her money so one day she'll see her honey up in heaven, oh up in heaven..."   and the women are dancing, and we're a table away laughing, and i keep looking for the collection plate, because, damn, this is really something.

       today i got a call from gail, who is an old friend that stopped talking to me for no good reason.  i should be upset about her lack of communicado.  instead, i am thrilled to bits.  gail is the kind of friend you can drink with during the day.  two martinis for lunch, that's gail.  she likes buying hats.  she smokes and gambles and owes mastercard about 60,000 dollars.  she always orders a steak.  she has a purse for every pair of shoes, and a pair of shoes for every purse.  her bedroom is like a warzone; the piles of toys and clothes and hamburger wrappers and wax statues of robin williams are like little foothills you can hide behind during periods of rapid gunfire.  or, you know, whatever.  she loses things easily.  she knows about sales ahead of time.  she's passionate about tv shows, could care less about politics.  she likes cheese and monkeys.  she buys things off of the home shopping network.  she likes going to baseball games, but only for the food.  she doesn't get pissy about paying for parking.  she'll go to vegas on a whim with a bunch of lesbians.  no, really.  she likes things really big or really small.  she has no concept of time.  she gets passionately angry when friends miss her birthday, which is what i did when i said "for no good reason."  i had a good excuse, though. anyhow, she'll stop talking to you for months at a time, and then call you out of the blue.  that's gail.  oh, how i've missed her.

       so our roommate took the laundry room key to las vegas.  this is what i'm assuming, because i can't find it anywhere, and he was the last one to use it before shipping out westward, ho.  this upsets me.  most things upset me, really, but this especially upsets me.  even more so than the fact that i'm sitting here in wet pants (different story for a different time).  i'm about to trudge off to the laundry mat yesterday with a pocket full of quarters when i notice one of our neighbors outside getting her mail.  i've never talked to this particular neighbor before, but i ask, "can i use your laundry key?  mine is in nevada."  she looks at me oddly for a moment, and at first i think she's going to say no.  i'd probably say no to me; who's stupid enough to trust a girl with dead plants all over her porch with their very sacred, lose-it-and-pay-seventy-bucks-to-replace-it laundry key?  apparently, this chick would fall into that category.  "sure," she replied.  "i'll go get it."  i do my laundry- whites, colors, towels, jeans, delicates all in one load.  time spent separating is often better spent eating a candy bar or singing along with a billy joel album.  i go to return the key, and my neighbor asks if there's anything else i need.  she turns out to be extremely friendly, this woman that i've mostly avoided these past 11 months.  she tells me her name, the hours that she's normally home, and briefly outlines a list of things she could potentially do for me.  lend me the laundry key.  watch for packages being delivered.  resurrect any dead dogs i might have lying around.  she was ultra nice, and i'm glad i met her.  i wouldn't have met her if my laundry key hadn't been in las vegas.  but, let's face it, i really wish my laundry key hadn't been in las vegas.  what a ridiculous place to take a laundry key, wouldn't you say?

       a british couple approached us in memphis, asking if we were from around there and knew how to get to beale street.  this was while we were sitting by the mississippi, contemplating the lyrics to "proud mary," in which a young tina turner confesses to never having seen the good side of the city- until she hitched a ride on a riverboat queen.  "how much tane do you think she actually pumped in new orleans?"  i was pondering aloud as the brits posed their questions.  no, we're not from around here, but yes we do know where beale is.  they thanked us with a "cheers!" and then hurried on their way.  i love the word "cheers!" as a good-bye, a thank-you, or a much more sophisticated "aloha!"  watching their british backsides scurry away, i got to thinking that i might want to start saying "cheers!" more often.  when i say "more often," what i really mean is "at all."  the thing is, i can't say "cheers!" without fearing that i'm sounding like a stupid, yankee wank.  a wankee, if you will.  it's like when white people say "damn bitch, you supa fly.  lemme pull up dat bumper and smack dat monkey."  people just don't look kindly upon it.  maybe if i could do a british accent, i could carry the whole thing off.  as it is, i'm from the midwest, the place where accents come to die.  this is unless you're counting that sometimes exaggerated chicago accent, where the letter "a" comes out sounding like a drunken whine.  the only people i've ever heard with that accent are the irish cops on the south side.  and even they sound like they're faking it a little.  anyhow, i think i'm going to start trying it.  test the waters, if you will.  first, it will begin at work, with customers i'm unlikely to see again.  then, i will use it at the grocery store, with the produce boy.  the next phase will include incorporating my local postal officers.  then i work it in with acquaintances and cousins twice removed.  finally, loved ones and friends.  who will say, "has anyone told you yet that you sound like an asshole?"  and then i will shuffle off to the loo, to cry.

       how does a three horse town in tennessee and an ancient city in egypt end up with the same name?  was memphis, tennessee settled by egyptians?  is one memphis a portal to the other?  or is it just a strange coincidence, like accidentally wearing velvet pants to the liberace museum?  we just got back from memphis, one time home of kathy bates.  yes,  the  kathy bates.  unfortunately, there were no kathy bates sightings.  also not sighted:  elvis, gas stations, book stores, or waldo.  here are some highlights from our little weekend south of the (illinois) border:  1.  when dan jumped the rope at graceland, ran upstairs, and took a dump in elvis' famed toilet.  2.  when chris mocked that cop's accent and consequently got us arrested, which resulted in a phone call to chris' mom, who promptly mailed us a cake with a knife baked in.  actually, it was a bowl of pudding with a spoon buried in it, but i'll tell you- it did the trick.  3.  when rachel stood in the middle of beale street and demonstrated all the new bird calls she had learned earlier that day from that lady who stood by the post office, completely covered with pigeons.  i think they exchanged email addresses, rachel and that bird lady.  4.  when the mayor of memphis called me at the motel 6 and asked if i'd ride in a float in the annual memphis parade.  i said, "sure, i love a good parade," but then forgot to show up due to getting sidetracked by a plate of roast beef sandwiches.  i read later that they had to cancel the parade.  i feel a little bad, but, hey, it's not my town.  graceland makes me sad, for many reasons.  i feel a link with elvis; maybe i used to be elvis.  it is possible.  are females always females in past lives?  yet another thing to ask my psychic friend.  thanks, dan, for driving all the way down and back.  the only thing i want to mention is that sitting behind dan- tall, lanky dan who needs his car seat pushed all the way back- is one of those rare situations that makes me wish i had prosthetic limbs.  like, ones that would detach.  legs i could just toss in the trunk, maybe stick into a box and mail.  it's rough sitting cramped up in a car for eight plus hours, both ways.  but worth it.  good friends, good times, good roast beef sandwiches.  no parade.

        chapter 26   the three girls- kitty, alice, and joni- met the three guys- max, adam, and todd- near the entrance of the cave.  "this is where the bloody murder of my twin sister kimmy happened," kitty nervously stated for purposes of exposition.  "you see how the rocks and soil are still stained with her blood?"  todd was near tears; kimmy had been his date for the prom, and now he'd have to settle for either alice or joni, both of whom were significantly flatter chested than the very vivacious, no-bra-wearing kimmy.  "i'll rip apart the bastard the slayed her," he said in a throaty voice.  "if only i could find out who it was."  "that's what we're here to do," joni reminded him pointedly, crouching in the dirt.  "oh my.  do you see what i see?"  a hush fell over the group.  finally, adam responded, "um, no.  unless you mean all those empty pop cans and frito-lay bags.  somebody should call the 4-h club."  "we are the 4-h club," todd spat, getting even more upset.  "or at least we were before the department of agriculture revoked our last 'h.'  who wants to be in a  3 -h club?"  "it's probably less work," max reasoned.  joni was getting impatient.  she shook her hair in such a fashion that her pretty, sun-kissed, heavily moisturized curls bounced daintily about her pretty, sun-kissed, heavily moisturized face.  "i'm talking about that piece of twine right there in the cave."  the six of them gave a collective gasp, alice adding an "oh my," for effect.  joni, voted most likely to make it into chapter 27, squinted up her eyes and did some quick calculations in her head.  "the killer must have used that twine to tie up kimmy.  then he or she dragged kimmy here and that's where her intestines were ripped out like a subscription card in a teen magazine.  now who has access to twine?"  all eyes landed on kitty, who had been employed at the twine and duct tape store in the mall since page two of the prologue.  todd choked out, "you.  you monster.  you killed kimmy."  kitty's lips curved into a mysteriously mysterious smile.  then they curved wider until they became amusingly amused.  "took you guys long enough," she said.  "but the question is why i did it."  "yes, kitty, tell us why," alice cried, and the group settled into a semi-circle in the grass, eagerly awaiting to hear the details of the murder.  max offered to start a fire.  joni contemplated aloud whether or not they should get a pizza.  "extra pepperoni," kitty requested.  "anyhow, it all started when todd asked kimmy to the dance instead of me.  we are identical twins, you know.  our chest sizes are identical.  so why her, and not me?"  "because," todd began, introducing the twist.  "i know you're not actually her twin.  you hatched out of an alien egg seventeen years ago and just took kimmy's form.  you're not human.  you don't even like bill murray."  "not true," kitty protested.  "i love jim belushi."  "but...." max was confused.  "oh well.  go on."  "so i lured her here under the premise of saving a starving squirrel.  then, when her back was turned, i deftly tied her up with some twine, dragged her out here, and spooned out her guts with a ladle."  everyone looked at adam, who worked at the ladle and shovel store in the mall.  he pretended to be engrossed in a hangnail.  "and now that you've found me out," kitty said slowly, savoring the moment like one would savor a day at the novelty sock store, "i have to kill you all.  adam, my spoon please?"  "not so fast," roared todd, who leapt to his feet wielding a gun.  "where'd you get that gun from?" joni gasped.  "i work at the gun store," todd declared.  "just started yesterday.  my manager said i could keep this one as long as i didn't shoot anyone."  "what's the point of having a gun if you're not going to shoot anybody?"  max questioned.  "and i still don't understand what jim belushi has to do with anything."  "i'll show you the point."  todd grinned as he began to club kitty to death with the barrel of his new toy.  he stopped when he got to adam, though.  "i need a deal on spoons," he muttered.  adam scampered away.  alice jumped up.  "another exciting mystery solved by the 3-h club," she cheered.  that's when joni pulled off her mask.  it wasn't joni at all.  todd narrated, "and now it's getting complicated.  i wonder what chapter 27 holds."

        things i've learned from christopher pike books:   how to figure out when you're dead.  how to spot vampires.  how to juggle both a full-time serial killer job while still being a full-time high school student.  your best friend probably wants to kill you, while utilizing a very elaborate plot.  extraordinarily elaborate especially when you realize that she's only a high school student.   when something's written in italics, you'd better believe it's a major clue as to what the hell's happening.   just because you're out there chasing demons and killers doesn't mean that you can't have a very fulfilling love life as well.  when you come back in time to warn yourself of future events, you're definitely not going to notice yourself.  guns are surprisingly easy for sixteen year olds to obtain.  residue from your past lives is even harder to get rid of than residue off that 30 year old, never cleaned shower curtain.  a vacation is never just a vacation.  a vacation is just a prelude to a funeral or an arraignment.  they're not brother and sister after all.  they're wolves taking the form of humans and they're also lovers.  if somebody eats ten big macs and drinks 4 gallons of milk in chapter six, the only way to kill them in chapter seven is with an exorcism.  aliens are usually helpful.  and they're always smarter than us.  usually, we find out that the aliens are us, only fifty decades into the future.  they've come back with a warning.  are you listening or are you listening?  the seventeen year old girl is smarter than the chief of police, the captain of the space shuttle, and all the seasoned detectives in the tri-state area.  how to foil the bad guy by using only one piece of twine, a flashlight, and two milk duds.  mix ingenuity and stir.  rest assured: before you foil him/ her, he/she will tell you exactly how he/she did it and why.  can't figure out who somebody really is?  think anagram!  what to do when you come across a witch.  what to do when you come across a ghost.  what to do when that ghost is yourself.  a lot of this could have been avoided if you just didn't sleep with my boyfriend.  nothing exciting occurs east of the mississippi.  isn't it funny how all this goes down only days before graduation?    tobecontinued...

       ragtime: the musical that i star in every 28 days.  i know that so many of you out there are interested in my menstrual cycle, and that's why i choose to talk about it.  part of the beauty of being female is that you can give birth.  because birth is so beautiful.  having your period is all part of that glorious cycle, the cycle of LIFE, and we, as females (and some of you more sensitive males), are supposed to celebrate it.  the only reason i celebrate it is because it means that, for another month at least, i'm not CONTRIBUTING to the cycle of life, if you catch my drift.  now, i'm not a regular girl.  when i say i star in ragtime every 28 days, it's 28 days give or take, like, ten, and of course i'm never prepared for it.  i try to carry tampons around regularly in my purse, but inevitably they fall out of their wrappers and then i'm at the jewel-osco extracting my credit card when suddenly this totally exposed tampon, usually with some gum stuck to it, just topples onto the counter.  and then i have to say something to the usually older-gentleman type cashier.  "oops, isn't this embarrassing?" i remark, paying for my cheese wheel.  "hey, you got a trash can back there?"  so i throw out all my naked, wrapperless tampons, and then a day later, bam, it's like the floodgates have not only been opened but thoroughly doused and destroyed by a substance i find not beautiful or celebratory but instead rather bothersome and disgusting.  like creamed corn.  without the chunks of corn.  and there i am without a tampon, wearing light pants.  or no pants, depending.  of course, it happens at work, when i'm in the middle of a forty-five minute ordeal with problem patient #298.  "listen," i say, trying to speed things up because the situation below my waist is turning disasterous.  "you'll have to excuse me-"  "no, you listen to me NOW," problem patient #298 bellows, the volume of her voice knocking her new wig slightly askew.  "i can't SEE out of these glasses."  "that's because you've got them on upside down.  now if you'll just-"  "and is your doctor even licensed?  he wasn't very professional.  i want to know why he was playing 'wario world' back there...."  "wario world's a great game," i attempt to explain as i pale from substantial loss of blood.  "but if you'll just give me about ten minutes to run to the drug store, i promise i'll listen to what you think about wario world...."  "listen, little girl," #298 spits, "is that an italian last name?  where's your family from?  we're sicilian ourselves."  this is where i get angry.  "we're NOT sicilian.  now i'm thirty seconds away from ruining my SOCKS on top of everything else, so EXCUSE ME PLEASE!"  so, what do we have here?  unneccessarily disgusting stories, cramps, bloating, frequent bathroom trips, the rising cost of absorbent cotton, and people who don't think that wordplay on the musical "ragtime" is all that funny.  plus, i'm sick of people bashing wario world.  enough is ENOUGH.  i apologize in advance for this entry.  i mean... ah, never mind.

        urlLink "action movie: the play."   we saw this movie-play in honor of jason's 24th birthday.  god, i can't even imagine turning 24.  it sounds so old.  i think i'll just stay 23 for another couple... months.  anyhow, it was a great night out down at ye olde chopin theater.  my only beef was with the ludicrous amounts of gunshots.  i'm a very jumpy person.  i can't sit still and relax during loud, ear-popping gunshots.  i'm forced to cringe and burrow myself deeper into my seat cushions.  hell, i can't play "perfection" without flying out of my pants every time that stupid tray pops out- how am i supposed to deal with gunshots?  yeah, i'm asking YOU.    caption:  i always thought i'd lose an eye playing this game.  anyhow, blanks.  they can kill.  then there are wad cutters, which look like blanks, but aren't.  they are deadly mo-fo's, these wad cutters.  see, there's the possibility that, in a situation like a play, somebody can goof and put wad cutters instead of blanks.  or, if they're especially vengeful and crafty,  not  goof.  i learned this from a christopher pike book.  it's this possibility, coupled with the skull-knocking *blast* and *boom* from the gun, that contribute to one rattled set of nerves: mine.  i'm the daughter of a man who belongs to the nra, and i can't stand the sight or sound of a gun.  which doesn't make sense, because i'm also the daughter of an italian man, and still i love me my pasta.

       we went out to dinner at one of our favorite restaurants, the place where we celebrated our one year anniversary six months ago.  the waitress brought dessert and i looked at it thinking, "this is obviously not sorbet."  i was about to complain.  she lifted up the lid, exposing the velvet box underneath.  then it was surreal, dreamlike, and i couldn't believe what was going on.  chris was suddenly on one knee.  i won't ever forget what he said.... and then he asked the question.  and now we are engaged.

       bank jackie  i have an interview for a bank.  upon hearing this, a friend suggested i simply open my own bank.     are you tired of bank tellers always asking for identification whenever you want to make a withdrawl?  (inside a bank.  there is a bank jackie teller and a short, fat puerto rican man wearing a torn and dirty t-shirt as the customer.)  bank jackie teller: (wide eyed and smiling) would you like all that in hundreds, mr. trump?  and are you tired of having to push all of those annoying buttons on the atm in order to get cash for the nudie bar?  (bank jackie atm is shown.  it spits out a constant stream of cash as customers drive by.  cars don't stop or slow down; the drivers simply roll down their windows to collect their money.)  are you tired of getting turned down for loans?  bank jackie associate is sitting at a desk, smoking, feet up and shoes off.  a shady looking man in a mask walks straight to the vault.)  bank jackie associate:  taking out a loan?  customer:  yeah.  bank jackie associate:  sounds good.  bank jackie.  in a world where hard working americans are constantly frazzled by daily banking transactions, we're here to help.  stop in today for your free sno-cone.   i'd be the most popular bank on the block.  for about a week, until i was forced to start charging for the sno-cones.

       i've got some balls up in the air as to my "career."  i've got an interview next week outside the company, and i've got my general manager and another general manager both trying to recruit me for a higher management position within my company, at the two different locations.  i'm frazzled and can't figure out what's best for me.  i guess no matter what, i'm going to walk away from this making more money, unless, of course, all my balls come flying down and smack me right in the face.  getting hit in the face by balls: not a good feeling.  generally speaking, of course.  i don't handle stress all that well.  it's a good feeling to know that i'm being fought over within the company, but it's a better feeling to know that somebody else may want me, too.  i just feel a little guilty over the whole thing.  is it so wrong to explore all of my options?  i'm saying yes to everyone right now, but soon i'm going to have to say no to somebody, maybe two somebodies.  i feel like i'm dating two brothers and then some other guy from, like, seattle or something.  one woman i work with is encouraging me to drop the balls and go back to school to be a teacher.  "you'd be a good teacher," she keeps saying.  i keep imagining myself in front of a classroom saying, "fuck the reading assignment, let's all get hotdogs."  it reminds me of when i briefly entertained the idea of moving to japan to teach english.  at the end of my stint, you'd have a bunch of japanese people running around saying, "like, um, well, yeah."  i'd also probably teach cursing, but, again, not on purpose.  in other news, chris and i have purchased airline tickets for los angeles in august.  i'm quite excited, mainly because my body feels at home in the pacific time zone.  what feels late central standard is just a little bit early out west, and so i'm bound to be on time to all of my engagements.  all swell always ends swell.

       i told my boss exactly how i feel.  what a novel idea not to keep things bottled up.  too bad my eyes starting watering like i was some sissy girl.  okay, so what if i'm a sissy girl?  the cheese and i went to the schaumburg library.  this is perhaps the biggest library i have ever been in, ever.  i'm talking it was the size of hershey, pennsylvania.  the different sections were designed like store fronts.  there's a cafe.  the cheese was amazed to find that schaumburg had two copies of some obscure book, when arlington didn't have any.  the whole trip blew our minds; of course, we are easily impressed.  i need a root canal.  i've been putting it off for years.  years.  so many years that i can't properly count, since i've been lying about it for so long.  "i've needed one for the past year," i'd say, when indeed it had been three.  "it's only been six months..." when actually it had been since the late nineties.  i'm afraid.  i'd rather wait for the tooth to just fall out.  no, i don't want that happening either.  maybe if i drink more milk, it will heal itself.  then i can write a book on how ignorance works better than flouride when it comes to dental care.  the cheese and i have passed the 1.5 year mark.  we've been living together for 1 year.  now if that doesn't blow the mind, then i don't know what does.  sometimes i fear that he will grow bored with me- then i remind myself of what a bundle of excitement and adventure i am, and i instantly feel better.  we got a check in the mail yesterday.  it was for three hundred thirty dollars, and it was unexpected and undeserved.  so i think we're going to blow it all on jell-o.

       teaching myself to play texas hold 'em poker, mainly because i want to say "i flopped my nuts."  that's what you say, right?  my self-training so far has consisted of losing multiple hands of yahoo poker and writing out a cheat sheet.  before tonight, i thought a straight flush was when you didn't dilly-dally after pooping.  alas, i'm always so wrong about so many things.  i want to play games with boys.  i've got bowling down, but i need work on pool and darts and spitting and target shooting.  this poker thing should be a snap, as long as i keep my cheat sheet handy.  and also perfect my sleight of hand.  i'd better take target shooting off the list.  don't want to accidentally blast off my own knee cap.  instead, i'll join the plumber's union 374 softball league.

           kingdom-phylum-class-odor....   i'm outside listening to birds when i think, "what an interesting hobby bird-watching would be!"  well, not interesting as in "this picture of chef boyardee making ravioli while wearing only one strategically placed red bow... is  interesting ," but interesting as in, "that jackie is always picking up new nuggets of information- she's so dang interesting!"  that's what i was going for, see.  on a lark (pun intended), i decided to see how many kinds of birds are native to illinois.  now, i would have guessed in the neighborhood of about eight or nine.  i mean, you have your warbler, your sparrow, a robin or two, and your common owl, complete with spectacles and a library book.  how many other freaking birds can there possibly be?  go ahead.  guess.  wrong.  there's 427 on the illinois checklist.  i just don't have the kind of time to invest in such a complex project.  i do, however, still want a high-powered set of binoculars.  also, a glass of milk.

       those breathe right strips really work.  and their  urlLink website  is really informative.  my snoring i.q. is off the charts.  i don't snore.  i do sometimes talk in my sleep, but they have yet to invent a shut-up-right strip.  my partner has a tendency to snore.  for the past few nights, "we've" experimented with the strips.  he comes into the bedroom with that adhesive on his nose looking like he's recovering from a fight down at the pool hall. "oh!  my nose!  now i'll never be a teen model!"  our bedroom is as quiet as a nunnery after light's out.  everybody, the two of us, both get to sleep.  i am no longer waking up with a start, wondering if it's thundering outside.  the only time i wake up with a start is if i sleepily announce, "but i don't want to go to space camp," and then hear it.  otherwise: nunnery.  i doubt my partner will be happy i'm announcing his snoring struggles via internet.  but, hey, i didn't use any names.

       i woke up this morning unable to open my right eye.  the pain was akin to what montana might feel like were it to be shoved beneath my eyelid.  after several frantic attempts, i was finally able to blink.  however, i could not keep it open for longer than a second.  this made it very hard to apply my make-up.  i had a big meeting i was supposed to attend today, about forty-five minutes away.  i got into my car and managed to go halfway down the block.  when i realized, though, that i'd probably need sight to drive, i had to turn around and come back home.  i was now up to keeping my eye open for 30 seconds at a time.  while this was an accomplishment to be celebrated, i'm afraid it wasn't enough.  at home, i passed out for a few hours and then awoke at noon.  i could keep my eye open for a full minute before having to squeeze it back shut; now the pain was only as if a smaller state, such as wisconsin, was wedged beneath my eyelid.  again, a success, but, in the broader picture, not enough.  i tried watching tv for a while when i was up to about three minutes without having to shut it other than for normal blinking.  i was watching an episode of 'step by step' that involved cody being adorable when suddenly, i couldn't hear anything.  i thought my ears had blown.  my mind raced- no sight, no hearing, i was morphing into helen keller!  i told myself to calm down.  then i picked up a book and slammed it against the coffee table.  it made a loud banging sound that made me jump.  so i could hear.  that was good.  it was the tv that had the problem, not me.  which was bad.  because while watching cody is fun, it's nicer if you can hear his voice.  after about half an hour, the tv fixed itself.  it still feels like a state is in my eye socket, but i think i might be okay.  even though my cornea is burning.  prognosis:  not so good.

       there were 32 ads in the sunday paper for dental assistants.  32!  i didn't know there was such a demand, but i suppose it does take a special person to suction a mouth and then arrange those sharp silver instruments ever-so-neatly on the paper lined tray.  and not just any shmuck can tell you where to spit without sounding vulgar.  32 ads.  and yet there was only for one for dog groomer.  another thing i noticed in the paper was an ad for aldi cashiers.  aldi is the place where you can buy six weeks worth of generic food for approximately $4.97.  their prices are outrageously low- and yet they pay their cashiers $11.62 per hour! unbelievable.  a cashier making more than $11 per hour?  with paid vacation?  my hourly rate as an OPTICIAN was $12.16.  i was barely making more than an aldi cashier.  of course, my new rate ain't that much better, but let's not be discussing that now.  looking through the want ads puts me in a strange state of mind.  it makes me think that i can do anything, from truck-driving to installing fire alarms to being a chemist to a caterer to, yes, dog grooming.  there's a world of options out there!  then i put down the want ads, inhale deeply, and understand that there's only a few things i can do while maintaining a manageable level of happiness.  too bad dental assistant would not be one of those things.

       the first thing my dad said was, "this apartment smells like gas."  i'd been smelling gas for the last two weeks, but a) i wasn't sure if it really was gas and b) i didn't know what to do if it was indeed a gas leak.  so i let it be.  chris was pretty much on the same wavelength as me.  "it smells like gas, but i don't feel like telling anyone about it."  so my dad moved the stove and proceeded to take a lighter and set the entire gas line on fire.  he just flicked the lighter and, *poof*, the entire rope connecting the stove to the gas line went up into flames.  i immediately freaked out, but my dad assured me that it was no problem.  "so what if part of your kitchen is on fire?  it's no big deal."  he rationalized, "it's better if it burns than if it doesn't."  i didn't see the logic in this.  i called the maintenance people, and a mexican was dispatched to the apartment in under ten minutes.  he inspected the area in question and then came back a few minutes later with another gas rope.  he must have had a box of these things lying around somewhere.  which makes me think this happens all the time.  biweekly, even.  "so what's the worst thing that happens with a gas leak?"  i asked my dad, to make small talk.  "it leaks and either the apartment blows up or you die from carbon monoxide poisoning."  "oh.  so it's a lose-lose situation?"  "yes."  well, thank god that's taken care of now.  we'd have let it go on for months, years, without taking any sort of action, until one day i either went to work with no eyebrows or, perhaps, dead.  speaking of dead, later we ended up talking about jaclyn dowaliby.  does anyone remember her?  they made a movie about her starring shannen doherty as the mother.  jaclyn was a girl who was in my grade school in midlothian who was kidnapped and killed.  i was always obsessed with her when i was little, because i had kind of known her, she had my same name, and she was a little girl like me, only dead.  i had almost seen her as a sort of sister figure- my helpless, sweet, midlothian name-twin found slain in a basement.  she had lived only a few blocks away.  maybe we would have grown up to be best friends.  at least i assume we would have, if only the unspeakable hadn't happened.  there are certain figures that i feel incredible bonds with.  jaclyn dowaliby has always been one of them, more so when i was little.  she even looked like me, a tad, with her dark hair and brown eyes.  looking at pictures of her now, on the internet, i am shaken.  another incredible bond i have always felt is with anne frank.  i am certain, about 97% certain, that if past lives do exist, my past life was anne frank.  some people like to think they were cleopatra or some other sexy egyptian; i think i was a girl in an attic keeping a diary.  she seems more optimistic than i would have been, but maybe living through her life hardened me for this one.  even when i look at pictures of anne frank, i feel that connection.  when i read her diary, it was like reading an old journal, or blog, entry that i had scrawled out a few weeks ago.  i'm not a mystic, but i'm just saying- there's something there.  anne frank and jaclyn dowaliby.  how can i explain?  i can't.  all the gas fumes have gone to my head, and i'm not being coherent.

       i'm very excited about the possibility of going to los angeles in the month of august.  i want to see if any of my preconcieved notions are correct.  will it be teeming with illegal immigrants offering to mow my lawn?  will the smog be so thick that i'll be able to swim from one end of the block to the other?  will jennifer lopez be waltzing around while six photographers from the E! network, all disguised as bushes, snap photographs of what's she eating, where's she scratching, and how she's reapplying her lip gloss?  i don't know.  san francisco was a great place to visit.  i felt like i had entered a storybook land, or an episode of 'full house.'  seattle was fantastic, also a storybook land or perhaps starbucks commercial.  vegas, also storybook land or episode of 'world tournament of poker' mixed with the software title '12,000 alcoholic beverage recipes.'  that's where i've been out west so far; when i imagine los angeles, i see a dirtier, flatter, yet star-studded near-chicago.  maybe i'm wrong.  maybe i'm right.  maybe i'll accidentally knock down the hollywood sign while careening around in my rent-a-car looking for the in-&-out burger.  either way, i'm excited, and i hope to spend time at the beach and at various los angeles monuments, such as the bowling alley used in 'the big lebowski.'  i'm also looking forward to meeting chris' friends, who shall be my friends by default.  ah, de-fault.  the two loveliest words in the language.

       one of those days with the wedgie that won't quit.  every four minutes, i'm yanking at the butt of my pants in an attempt to set free my undies from the trap they have uncomfortably nestled themselves into.  after a while it's habit; i'm grabbing at my butt while talking to customers, and i'm sticking my entire hand down the back of my pants to shlep out my bunched in panties while having Serious Discussions with upper management on why sales are so low.  only after the sixth or seventh time do i consciously realize what i'm doing.  my automatic thought after bashfully retrieving my hand is, "no wonder i'm single."  but, the thing is, i'm not.  i'm in the kind of relationship where it's not only acceptable to pick at my own ass, but it's also kind of expected.  that's why life is good right now.  that's also, however, why i feel like i was 'carefully avoided' today by certain peers.  ah, to hell with them.  you give, you take, you stop buying fancy underthings.

       the ad:   we are looking for a highly motivated, creative individual to spearhead a marketing campaign for a fortune 500 company.   the recruiter:   wanna sell sox tickets?   it's tiring being jackie.  i'm supposed to get promoted in one month.  do i want the promotion?  should i keep looking for other jobs?  if i get another job that advertises itself as a career opportunity as a leader in some grand financial company, will i end up telemarketing spoons?  will i be going door to door selling coupon books?  i discussed my career follies with friends yesterday.  they said, 'you should be a stand-up comic.'  we all had a good laugh over that.  but maybe that's what i should do.  work on my material.  get in line for next season's "last comic standing."  i'm not  the  funniest person out there, but, yes, i am  one  of the funniest people out there.  especially because i steal other people's jokes.  i will be a writer one of these days.  not any day soon, but perhaps by thursday of next week, time and tv schedules permitting.  however, what's going to pay my bills?  retail management at an eyeglass joint?  perhaps.  cold-calling people in an effort to sell batteries?  doubtful.  warning to those of you wanting to major in marketing communications.  run now.  run to your local graphics design department, or english class, or accounting school.  maybe start driving trucks for a living.  take a culinary class at the community college and apply at applebee's.  do anything else.  be a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker.  i've seen the future, and the future's seen me.  now we're just trying to decide where to lay down.

       at work, the six of us spend two hours deciding what we're going to eat for lunch.  silvia walks around with a pen and a pad of paper asking everyone, "what do you want?"  they ask her back, "well, where are you going?"  and she replies, "i don't know.  what do you want?"  it takes us more energy to decide what to have for lunch on any given day than the total amount of energy we exert in helping patients for that whole particular week.  then there's the clamor of no correct change.  we pick one unfortunate soul to go pick up our order, and i give them my debit card.  "charge mine," i say.  silvia gives a debit card as well.  diana only has five bucks; linda only has a twenty.  mary's got a handful of quarters, and john's left his wallet at home. so it goes, and two people always end up paying for 75% of the order. i spent 30 dollars at boston market the other day.  for a small salad.  sometimes i say, "i'm not eating out today.  i brought my 'healthy choice' entree."  this results in silvia getting a pouty look on her face.  "lunch is fun," she insists.  "you can only have fun if you order out like us."  i give in.  "fine," i say.  "where are you going?"  "i don't know," she replies, "what do you want?"  those healthy choice meals- you need to have about two before you can begin to feel full.  and if you have two, people look at you like you're a wierdo.

       i'm reading a book in which the man goes back in time so that he can have sex with himself.  it seemed an innocent enough tale of time travel.  then it turned trashy.  and let me just say that i'm strangely fascinated with it.  who writes this kind of garbage?  who would publish something like that while their parents were still alive?  or any relatives, really?  you gotta have a little taste.  of all the situations this main character could have gotten himself into- i mean, c'mon, he's time traveling, here- the author chooses to make him auto-homo-erotic.  this is not unique in time travel books, as the cheese reminded me.  but it's still mildly disturbing.  it still has me awake at night.  if i could time travel, would i fool around with an older or younger jackie?  i'd like to think not.  but maybe time travel does that to you.  it makes you attracted to yourself.  it also, as michael j. fox has shown us, is a leading cause of parkinsons.  hello line.  have i crossed you once more?

       how many people already thought that reagan was dead?  how long do you think the news media has been waiting to publish their "reagan's life in review" timelines?  because, let's face, they've had these articles set for a while.  years.  a decade.  you think they threw all this together overnight?  i still don't know what reaganomics is.  i love a man, though, who comes up with an economic theory and names it after himself.  jackienomics.  did you know he was the original 'gipper?'

       all the ladies at work are talking about their kids and what kind of sports they play.  i never played any sports when i was little, except for that one sorry year in softball.  in high school, i also avoided sports.  i briefly considered joining the frisbee team in college, but, let's face it, who wants to play frisbee all the time?  that's the kind of "game" that you can play once a summer, every third summer.  like croquet or horseshoes.  i just can't get into activities like that, unless they involve sandwiches and some kind of ball boy.  the sandwiches would be for eating, the ball boy would be for general amusement.  all this talk about sports makes me think that i'm not well rounded, because i never did anything active when i was little.  my mom and i used to set up the old plastic bowling pins in the basement and roll down the little plastic lettuce-head ball that came with it.  that was always relatively fun until we got sick of setting the pins up again after every turn.  i needed a pin boy is what i needed.  my cousin and i would play tennis once in a while when we were in perhaps fifth or sixth grade.  really, we played twice, each time for ten minutes.  then we'd go home with slurpees and get out the legos.  legos: fun.  tennis: not so much.  at least, if a kid doesn't play sports, he/she/it should play an instrument.  i don't know how to play any instruments.  i'm not even sure of the names of most instruments.  is it a banjo or a xylophone?  beats the crap out of me.  one thing for sure: it's not a sandwich.  i did try to teach myself guitar once.  i learned three chords in three days and then dusted my hands of such nonsense and turned to conquer other things, such as making sure my rental movies got back on time and complaining about the lack of gatorade in the house.  "why do you need gatorade?" mom would ask.  "it's a drink for *athletes*."  that's when i would throw a small object at her, such as a typewriter.  it was her fault i wasn't well rounded.  people have to be shaped when they're young, by their parents.  which is why, when i have kids... i'll teach them everything i know about... or at least i'll let them drink all the yoohoo they could possibly... maybe they could learn trombone while competing in rugby... well, we'll always have the sandwiches.

       i am officially hunting for another job. i am the loin-clothed, leaves-covering-up-nipples she-predator in the dangerous forest of unspecified salaries and vague questions about ambitions. what am i cut out to do? i don't like selling things. i don't like numbers. i prefer not to wake up before nine. i don't enjoy commutes over ten minutes. i want to be the boss, but i don't like bossing other people around. i dislike wearing pants. i especially dislike wearing skirts. where can i go that will allow me to wear a robe?  i am spiraling into a depression filled with reality t.v. shows, cigarette smoke, daytime beers, and the kind of stress that makes me feel like i have lockjaw. which makes it especially hard to consume those daytime beers. i'm ready to go back to school now, but i'm not ready to pay. i don't really have the money, which is funny since i spent over a hundred dollars yesterday on getting my hair done. i guess i'm just trying to make up for all those beauty college cuts and stain-the-bathroom-tile-pink d.i.y. dye jobs. i have a hundred dollars for highlights. i don't have thirty for an application fee.  if you live in the chicagoland area and want to hire me to sit around, tell jokes, and eat mars bars, please contact immediately. i can contribute lots to your company; i'll even participate in a car pool as long as my other passengers don't mind sitting in garbage while i blare bad music and knock over construction cones. why is everything under construction these days? i feel like my own construction project: i'm trying to widen from one lane to three with an expected completion date of never

       well, i've officially fallen in love for a third time.  sure, i fall in "love" a fair amount, but this is the third time i've fallen in LOVE.  the first time i fell in love was with a bookish lad who used the words "ideology" and "social ramifications" more than i use the word "sonuva," as in "sonuva bitch, who ate my last bagel?" and also the word "poopy" as in "since my last bagel was gone, i was forced to eat leftover mac-n-cheese, which is now making me feel rather poopy."  he was a smart young man, and i enjoyed our time together despite the fact that these times were always a little poopy.  you just can't disregard raw, physical attraction, even if it involves somebody who reads karl marx for fun.  the second time i fell in love was with my current beau, who also appreciates the word "poopy" and could probably make a few poopies right on the carpet and still have it come off as rather adorable.  what can i say about chris that i haven't already said?  sure, he gave me an alarm clock for christmas, but let's think about what he gives me EVERYDAY... happiness.  also, tacos.  now the third time i fell in love was today, during yet another episode of "what not to wear" on tlc.  this particular boy is called  urlLink eric , and he really didn't need a makeover because he was so damn hot as it was.  after all the shopping and the hair cutting and teeth whitening, though?  goddamn fabulous.  plus, his attitude throughout the show was incredible.  see, girls like being made over.  gay men, too.  your average straight guy (and i'm sure he's straight) usually is not so good-natured.  he just kept smiling and laughing through-out the whole show, and it truly won me over.  also, did i mention that he's gorgeous?  this doesn't happen everyday.  if you do the math, it happens to me once every 8 yrs.  while that is obviously not how it actually works out, i'd like to say that mathematically, it's correct.  precise.  i should probably stop watching reality-makeover-dating shows.  it's healthier for me to develop crushes on fantasty figures, like johnny bravo or john goodman.  not some semi-attainable reality show hunk who currently resides in chicagoland.  maybe he's my neighbor, for all i know.  cripes.  i wonder if he and chris would get along.  i wonder why i'm such a jackass.  also, i wonder what we're going to have for dinner tonight.  i hope it's nothing poopy.

       my bank does this adorable thing where they give me an "available balance" and a "current balance."  the two are always completely different amounts, seemingly chosen at random by some sadist down in their account management department.  today i check my online banking ledger, and, bam, the difference between these two numbers is over a thousand dollars.  a thousand five hundred, to be exact.  egads!  and then when i attempt to find out what, exactly, is the difference between "available" and "current," that same sadist has me staring at the screen for over twenty minutes as i try, without luck, to decipher their subtleties.  this is especially not good because i think i have conjunctivitis yet again, and staring in deep concentration probably does naught for the healing process.  "current" and "available" sound like the same thing to me.  those assholes.  anyhow, i'm either broke or rich.  i have no idea which.  who is to pay for confusing the account holder?  in other non-related news, i've decided i want to go on tlc's "what not to wear." these people get flown to manhattan and basically handed a check for something like five grand for splurging.  also, they get a haircut and make-over.  now, i don't want anyone cutting my hair, but my highlights do need retouching, so they can do that.  also, maybe somebody could curl my eyelashes.  i used to try that when i was younger but would inevitably end up hurting myself.  severely.  i do need to get nominated before i can go on the show, though.  i need to prove that i am badly in need of this wardrobe make-over.  so i have decided to wear nothing but misshapen dresses created entirely of kraft american cheese singles.  "tell me about this particular dress," the hosts will say in disgust as they hold up cheese dress # 14.  "it's one of my favorites," i'll tell them, "although it's missing a sleeve due to a violent encounter with a band of mice."

       christopher j. koch's "the year of living dangerously" wins the jackie award for "coolest book title, ever."&nbsp; i wish i had come up with that title; as it is, i suppose i can only parody it now.&nbsp; the year of living cheesily?&nbsp; the year of pooping dangerously?&nbsp; i'll have to work on it, but the potential's there.   either way, this book has me obsessed with midgets.&nbsp; sorry, i mean&nbsp; dwarves .&nbsp; midget is a term that the little people don't take kindly to.&nbsp;&nbsp; what i don't get is that "midget" is bad, but "little people" is okay.&nbsp; to me, "little people" sounds condescending.&nbsp; and dwarf sounds just as bad, due of course to snow white and her seven dwarves, who had only one personality trait each.&nbsp; if i were a little person, i'd be severely pissed at disney and the grimm brothers.&nbsp; "why can't i be both sleepy and sneezy?" i'd ask, enraged.&nbsp; "is it not possible for me to be both hungry and dopey?"   i'd better stop before i get myself in trouble.   i've been listening to a lot of johnny cash lately.&nbsp; if any of my good friends, and you know who you are, has a johnny cash cd containing "i've been everywhere," i'd appreciate a copy.&nbsp; thanks in advance.&nbsp; your loyal servant, ferclyn.

       and now the question that has plagued man for ages: did tennessee what arkansas?  it took ten hours to get there and ten hours to get back.&nbsp; we were there for a day and a half.&nbsp;&nbsp;a highlight of that day and a half is when chris and i decided to go canoeing.&nbsp; we should have known it was doomed from the start; we managed to get out to the middle of the lake, and then we just floated around in a circle for a bit, unable to paddle our way back due to a strong current and also the fact that i have twig-like arms that aren't used to any brand of physical exertion- be it paddling or tennis or having to hold the remote control for an extended period of time.&nbsp; round and round we went; i imagined that the rest of our lives would have to unfold on this canoe.&nbsp; one end of the canoe would be for us, the other end for our children.&nbsp; it wouldn't be the biggest home, but it would be  our  home, minus walls and a door.   and a ceiling.   and electricity.   oh, and a mailbox.&nbsp;   fuck, it would be the crappiest home ever.&nbsp; i'd rather live locked under the kitchen sink with whoopi goldberg.&nbsp; and you know how i feel about whoopi goldberg.  we managed to row our way back after some time; his family had gathered on the beach and were yelling for us to hurry up.&nbsp; pictures were about to be taken, and it was of the utmost importance that chris' italian fiancee be caught on film standing amongst all the pale germans.&nbsp; our canoe picked up speed, rocketed ahead, and, with a crowd of people standing on the beach watching, the damn boat slammed right into the dock.&nbsp; calmly, chris called back to me, "paddle backwards," and suddenly i was reminded of my first time parrallel parking in the city, which is also the same story that leads to my first nervous breakdown.&nbsp; i'll tell that on another day.  anyhow, it was fun.&nbsp; a lowlight of the trip was having to share a room with chris' aunt, who is a wonderfully nice lady with a horribly awful snoring problem.&nbsp; i was tempted to suffocate her on saturday night, and i might have, too, if i didn't think i'd be prosecuted in a court of law.&nbsp; also, the whole weekend was about me trying to get in good with chris' family; killing his father's only sister probably wouldn't be the best way to go about that.  i did not return with any form of chiggers, for which i am happy.  &nbsp;

       today is interview number three.&nbsp; i've never had a third interview before.&nbsp; i wonder if this is like the critical third date in which you either have sex and continue the relationship or admit that it's not going to work out right after you have the guy pay the dinner bill.&nbsp; only time will tell.  in the next few weeks, i'm going to be meeting so many&nbsp;internet friends.&nbsp; i'll probably hang out with janice next week, and then when i'm in l.a., i'm going to meet dax and jessica and andrew.&nbsp; i've never met anyone off the internet before without the goal of procreation somewhere in the back of my mind.&nbsp; what an odd month i shall have.  i'm so nervous.&nbsp; i just downed my breakfast red bull and now i'm shaking like a seizure victim.&nbsp; i hope that doesn't ruin my chances, all the trembling and stuttering and the foaming at the mouth.&nbsp; i really want this job.&nbsp; manager of a bank.&nbsp; who would have thought that the girl who recently lost close to three hundred dollars at her current place of work would be considered to oversee... a lot more than three hundred.  wish me luck.&nbsp; don't forget to write.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       i must say that i feel very alone here in the blogosphere.&nbsp; most of my links are defunct, as about 92% of my friends no longer post, and&nbsp; i feel like the mayor of last-one-standingsville.&nbsp; population, three. &nbsp; main exports include inane banter, occasional spelling errors, and observations on how you can observe a lot just by watching. &nbsp; i hate my job and hope i am truly in transit to salarysville, which also goes by the names of suitsville, ninetofivesville, and gold-plated-name-on-my-desk junction.&nbsp; i especially hate my job because of a new sales leadership program, which includes asking if your patient needs a pair of "weekend glasses."&nbsp; what the fuck are "weekend glasses?"&nbsp; next month, they're going to have me inquiring about "sunday morning glasses."&nbsp; when will they understand that not every different activity or time of day requires a whole new eyewear purchase?&nbsp; i also hate that i have to say, "let's go shopping" to my customers, as shopping implies buying more than one item.&nbsp; shopping also implies checking out the competition.&nbsp; finally, i hate that we are in the middle of a remodel.&nbsp; everything is in total disarray.&nbsp; even though i suggested we use "bless this mess," our new sign states, "open during remodel!"&nbsp; silently, i also suggested that the sign read, "closed for store improvements," with a footnote reading "associates still getting paychecks," but i didn't even bother to open my mouth with that one.&nbsp; some people just don't get it. &nbsp; anyhow, this weekend we go to chris' family reunion.&nbsp; it's in tennessee, making that the second time in under three months that i've been to there.&nbsp; it's a shame, really, that it couldn't have been held in maui.&nbsp; then, two weeks after that, we jet off to los angeles.&nbsp; i will bring my screenplay with and finagle my way into the offices of various agents.&nbsp; then they will say to me, "this isn't a screenplay, it's just a berenstein bears coloring book.&nbsp; and you got their fur color completely wrong."&nbsp; to which i'll respond, "or did i get it more right than it's ever been before, and therefore just blow your mind?" &nbsp; we'll see.

       so, get this.&nbsp; i had two interviews at the bank to be a banking associate.&nbsp; then they call me and want me to interview a third time- TO BE THE MANAGER OF THE BANKING ASSOCIATES.&nbsp; talk about skipping to the front of the line. &nbsp; so, we'll see. &nbsp; last night, we went to the bamboo room, where they were supposedly filming "elimidate."&nbsp; i pulled my shirt a little lower hoping they'd recruit me to be a last minute cast member, but, no dice.&nbsp; this was a shame, because i had so many witty remarks i could have made on camera.&nbsp; instead, the world of shameless game-dating will have to live without my charm and .... never mind.

       i think everyone should watch "monk" on usa.  i would never have bothered watching "monk" if a certain janice, who used to glorify the horrifying, hadn't mentioned it once.  now, i can't get enough.  i think i want to be a mystery shopper.  i'd be good at it because i know what good customer service does and does not look like.  good customer service:  explaining that, even if i do mail in my rebate on time, there's a fairly high chance that i'll never see my $25.98 again.  bad customer service:  vomiting into my open purse and then sneezing on my hot dog.  i haven't written anything, besides blog entries, for a very long time.  now my fingers are starting to itch, and my brain is whirring with all of the fictional possibilities that are begging to be released.  i blame several things for this lack of activity.  one, the press.  two, the high sodium content of canned soups.  three, the fact that the people on "what not to wear" say things like "a pink shoe would complete this outfit" as opposed to "A PAIR OF PINK SHOES would complete this outfit."  i mean, who's going to go out and buy just one pink shoe?  how big would this one shoe have to be?  it would have to fit both feet- but would it also be big enough to fit a small child?  if so, we should put some wheels on this thing and call it a stroller.  who's with me?  now i'm upset.  if only "monk" were on.

        urlLink those wacky republicans  and  urlLink the things they come up with ....  check out the comments page.  it seems a fair and balanced look at... a condiment.  i thought i would check out heinz's page for a rebuttal.  instead, i found a quiz that promised to analyze my personality based on how, exactly, i use my heinz ketchup.  i'm sure it was written by a crack team of social scientists.  nonetheless, my result was:   You are a radical experimentalist, always looking for the new and the better. Willing to try anything once you find joy in ideas.  Never stop re-inventing yourself, therein lies your route to happiness   wow, isn't that right on the money.  it encouraged me to send my result to my life partner, as "ketchup couples" are proven to stay together.  this is based on totally inconclusive surveys done in grocery stores and one planned parenting joint.  after a while, when i kept seeing "mum" and "flavour," i knew i was (a) either on a british web site or (b) heinz had just been taken over by a bunch of pretensious floof-heads.  i'm sorry, but nothing gets me angrier than americans adding extraneous "u's" all over the fucking place.  the brits, however, are totally exempt from this rule of mine.  how i adore the brits.  anyhoo, i found the american website, which was considerably less colorful. i quickly grew tired of reading about lycopene, and forgot where i was going with this whole thing.

       today my parents are meeting chris' parents.  for those of you who know my parents, this is a potentially disasterous situation.  my mother is, to put it nicely, a total and complete nut-job.  she has far too many mental problems to begin to list, and, while mental problems like mine are kind of cute and endearing, her mental problems have created a sort of super-villain-like persona.  she's mean and rude and she has the look of somebody about to snap and take out a few innocent victims in the process.  the sneer on her face is permanent and deadly, and the inane questions that she'll bludgeon complete strangers with border on the frighteningly retarded.  i am scared.  be scared for me, too.  i'll try to laugh them off.  who will follow suit?  the other day i signed my name at work on all of the closing papers.  then it struck me: after i get married, i'll be signing a different name.  who is this jaclyn berger girl, and what will her signature look like?  i tried scrawling out the new name, but the "b" felt so unnatural.  cursive b's are a bit of a bitch.  it's going to take me upwards of two hours to sign my new name on credit card slips, police reports, admittane papers into local sanitariums, etc, etc.  i can't wrap my head, or signing hand, around it.  i guess i've got some time to get used to it.  or i could keep my name.  then the kids at my high school reunion will assume that, true to my word, i never did marry and just spent my life in solitude with an apartment's worth of cats.

       i got this cookbook entitled "have a ball making entire meals out of only four ingredients, you lazy fuck" (or something to that extent). this in my possession, i took that first important step towards housewifedom and made a complete meal out of only four ingredients.  four ingredients!  how could anyone mess that up?  and could life possibly get any more simplified?  i submit that it cannot!  then, today, i'm at the local book selling place when i see a cookbook with the approximate title of "make all these crazy dinners out of only THREE ingredients, sucka!"  had i been duped?  here i was using four whole ingredients when, maybe, i'd only needed three.  i felt like i belonged in "there's something about mary," in the scene where ben stiller and the insane hitchhiker are talking about seven minute abs.   you heard of this thing, the 8-minute abs? yeah, this is going to blow that right out of the water.  listen to this- 7 minute abs!   of course, they can't possibly do a two-ingredient cookbook.  who cooks with only two ingredients?  who works out in only six minutes?!?  unless- and now my mind is really racing- one of those two ingredients is a fully prepared lasagna made by, maybe, some homeless guy with an oven who's willing to exchange pasta for booze money.  and, no, i don't know where he'd plug in the oven.  it would have to be solar powered, or dirt powered.  if you do the math, that would leave you with only one more ingredient to add for that "two ingredient meal, fuckface" cookbook.  this second ingredient would have to be parsley.  you're supposed to add parsley to everything.  don't you look at the pictures?

       we arrived home at about 12:52 a.m. early sunday morning.  pulling into our complex, we were a bit alarmed to see the nine firetrucks and seven police cars that were littering the parking lot, along with the throng of residents.  some of them were only in bath robes or pajamas.  one woman was holding her cat.  i asked somebody, "what's going on?"  all the while i was thinking,  god, i must have left my blowdryer on.   it wasn't my building, though.  the building next to ours had caught fire, and that's all that anyone knew.  we hung outside for just a few seconds longer before heading inside to our safe, fire-free apartment.  from our windows, we could see the firemen running around and the glare of the emergency lights.  chris played a computer game.  i watched television.  we didn't get to bed until close to three.  the firemen were still outside; i had to turn the fan on to drown out their voices so i could get some ever important beauty rest.  the next morning, i labeled myself a jackass for being so able to effectively ignore a tragedy that had occured about three feet away.  people had lost their apartments, their clothes, their photographs, their cherished letters, their recently purchased copies of "my cousin vinnie."  everything, gone, every tangible evidence of personal histories.  i was upset at myself for, once realizing that it wasn't my building, not being all that concerned.  where's my sense of caring for humanity?  my empathy and kind, loving heart?  at last watch: jacksonville, florida.  here's the  urlLink news story  about it.

       like two peas in some kind of pea holding device...  so, i'm engaged.  my ring is too big, and now it's all scratched due to this ridiculous, semi-medieval ring guard doohickey.  it was a brilliant idea- don't get it properly resized because it's too hard to part with, simply use a painful sliver of metal to hold it in place.  stupid half assed idea.  i'll be going to the jeweler's on monday.  because we are poor, the wedding is not until march 2006.  chris has a family that roughly amounts to the population of idaho.  not that idaho is extremely populated, but you try buying dinners, drinks, invitations, and the extras for all those potato lovers.  it will not only break the bank, it will decimate it.  it will blow it to fiery bits and leave behind not enough for dental records to allow proper identification of the bodies.  those poor, poor tellers.  speaking of bankis, i had a situation at work.  long story short, three hundred bucks went stolen/ missing under my watch.  three hundred dollars, or approximately three hundred items from the dollar menu at burger king.  that's a lot of french fries.  it was a big issue that caused ulcers in places i don't care to mention, and then, two days later, i had an interview at a bank.  if you follow me, a bank is where they keep large amounts of money.  some banks keep large amounts of blood or sperm.  other banks just keep large amounts of free, souviner pens and old pieces of suck candies.  those are the kind of banks that my grandmother likes to frequent.  anyhow, i like to think of myself as a responsible person.  events such as the one that occurred last monday prove otherwise.  i just read an awesome book.  it's called "bringing down the house," and it's the story of card counters and how they took vegas for millions.  i am now concocting a scheme to take, say, fon du lac, wisconsin for millions.  this will require finding out if fon du lac has casionos.  or at least a grocery store, because i'm out of juice.

       1.  my birthday is tomorrow, the big 6-3.  i mean, the big 2-4.  magical things tend to happen on my birthday, such as in 2001 when my skin cleared up overnight, and, 1987, when that band of elves crashed into my bedroom and demanded that i eat their cupcakes.  2.  tonight, we leave for los angeles.  i have done lengthy research on los angeles and its surrounding communities, and have discovered several interesting tid-bits.   l.a. has the strongest pull of gravity in the entire solar system.  l.a. is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium.  l.a. has up to 39 moons, depending on who you ask.  i would weigh about 270 pounds in l.a.   oh, wait.  that's jupiter.  3.  i think i'm getting that job at the bank.  they're working on an offer.  i hope it looks like this:  200,000 dollars per year, plus all the string cheese i can reasonably eat, plus medical, dental, life, auto, fire, home, rental, and shoe insurance, plus a name plate the size of my face, plus the freedom to go pantsless on days when i plan on not standing up too often.  4.  everyone keeps asking me about the wedding.  they won't take "i don't know" for an answer.  i'm not exactly a planner, and the idea of having to coordinate this whole event is making me wonder if i should go on one of those wedding shows where five complete strangers plan your wedding on some predetermined budget.  the thing is, i don't want to end up getting married in a place that's been decorated to resemble the set of "welcome back kotter."  you have to watch out for these things.  have you ever seen these shows?  sheesh.

       this is a long overdue rant, but i feel it's an important topic that i should discuss.  am i talking about bush or abortion or gun control or tibet?  oh no.  what's on my mind today is sweat.  now, some girls in their late teens have problems with excessive perspiration.  finding an effective deoderant/anti-perspirant can be like hunting down jimmy hoffa- while wearing a shirt that's soaking wet.  anyhoo, my cousin and i had this same problem, and then she recommended certain dri.  ah, certain dri.  so long-lasting that it's still working hard  after 84 hours.   my god, do you know how many episodes of  seinfeld  that is?  more than ten.  (is it a bad thing that i tend to calculate time based on sitcom lengths?  i'm not sure either.)  so, i purchased some from the local sell-a-torium.  i applied as directed, and the next morning the pores in my armpits were literally fused shut.  no, i wasn't sweating, but i also couldn't raise my arms for fear that i would tear my tightly stretched skin.  i'd rip my armpit wide open, and my left lung would somehow go flying out.  and then there was the itching.  i couldn't decide which was more socially devastating- having small moist spots on my t-shirt or sitting in class while vigorously scratching away at my pits.  neither seemed to help when it came to attracting the gentlemen.  i was at a loss.  i kept using the certain dri, which seemed so hip in its spelling, much like how kristi is always cooler than kristy.  right?  right?  ha.  i had the tight skin, the itching, and then three days later, there was the burning and the redness.  it was like having a potluck of under my arms, except instead of savory, homemade dishes, i got stuck with... well, the itching, the tightness, the burning, and the redness.  aren't you paying attention?  i called my cousin.  "are you using the certain dri?"  i asked.  there was a careful pause, and then she whispered into the phone, "i scratched my pits so hard, they started bleeding."  eventually, i found other remedies for my sweating, such as prolonged exposures to doing nothing strenuous or nerve-wracking.  that worked well; i got a lot of drinking done.  eventually, i grew out of my sweatiness and forgot about the certain dri.  the other day, i remembered the whole thing when my cousin mentioned that, as a gag, she had tried that stuff on her feet.  long story short:  not a good idea.  certain dri is product number 728 on my "not to buy" list.  it's right below that one car freshener that smells like horse.
