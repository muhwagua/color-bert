        Please make sure you click the link for the pic...  "DECEMBER 5--Meet John Huffman. Here's what we know: On the night of October 29, while driving with a child in the passenger seat of his station wagon, the Tampa man rear-ended another vehicle at an intersection. We also know that after cops found Huffman, 34, unsteady on his feet, with alcohol on his breath, and in possession of three bags of pot, they charged him with driving under the influence, marijuana possession, and child neglect. What we're not sure about, however, is how that lousy makeup job and those words--immortalized in this Hillsborough County Sheriff's booking photo--got on Huffman's face. The TSG fan who tipped us off contends that the tipsy driver was marked up after passing out at a Halloween party earlier that evening. And we thought he just had a low opinion of himself."

      Wow...this certainly was unexpected.  "DECEMBER 9--A confidential investigation by Los Angeles police and child welfare officials concluded earlier this year that allegations Michael Jackson sexually abused a cancer-stricken boy were 'unfounded,' according to an internal government memo obtained by The Smoking Gun.  "The probe's findings were based, in large part, on interviews with the alleged victim, his two siblings, and the boy's mother. According to the memo, when the child was questioned in February by a social worker assigned to the Sensitive Case Unit of L.A.'s Department of Children & Family Services (DCFS), he 'denied any form of sexual abuse' by Jackson and said that he never 'slept in the same bed as the entertainer.' While not specifically named in the DCFS memo, the 45-year-old Jackson is referred to repeatedly as 'the entertainer.'"

"What you think of Paris Hilton, what she thinks of herself and what she's really like are three entities so separate and distinct that if they were people they wouldn't end up in the same room. You think -- if you think of her at all -- that Hilton, 22, is a stupid, spoiled, superficial socialite who dresses like a high-class escort and, given the recently disclosed pornographic video she made with an ex-boyfriend, probably acts like one, too. She thinks she's a pet lover who donates to charity, does not drink or do drugs and hardly ever goes out. 'I am not a party person,' says Hilton, blinking her catlike royal-blue eyes. 'Mostly I like to spend time with my dogs.'"

Trista Rehn and Ryan Sutter, the 'Bachelor' reject turned-'Bachelorette' and her man, have been living the high-profile life. They were at this year's White House Correspondents Dinner. They were followed around by a phalanx of photographers when they went to register for wedding gifts in L.A.'s Century City. They're discussed on web sites. And why? The reason is simply because they have a relationship, the same as millions of non-famous folk every day.There's lots of reality show flotsam swimming around the celebrity pool these days, as instantly well-known faces scramble to extend their fame beyond their limited series."

That's because the Tiffany Network actually opted for a prominent photo of Tonight Show host Jay Leno--instead of Dave--in its online promotion of Sunday night's People's Choice Awards. It wasn't until Letterman himself started ragging on CBS during the taping of last night's program that the image of his NBC rival was hastily deleted and replaced by a shot of the Late Show boss. Network brass apparently were so embarrassed by the gaffe that CBS president Leslie Moonves called Letterman during the Monday taping to apologize and say, apparently facetiously, that the employee responsible for posting Leno's photo on cbs.com had been fired. Below you'll find the before and after images from the network's web site, captured by TSG before the Leno art was deleted. While both Letterman and Leno were nominated in the favorite talk show host category, the People's Choice nod went to Oprah Winfrey. (1 page)"

Click  urlLink here  for the AP wire service obituary.   urlLink Julius Schwartz Tribute at DC Comics   Julius Schwartz, one of the best-loved and most influential members of both the comics and science fiction communities, died Sunday morning, February 8, in Winthrop Hospital in New York from complications from pneumonia. Schwartz was 88 years old.   Schwartz, who was popularly called "a living legend" and served as DC's Editor Emeritus, will be remembered as one of the founders of science fiction fandom, as a comic-book editor whose vision spanned five decades with DC Comics, and as the architect of comics' Silver Age, revitalizing the careers of such super-heroes as Batman, Superman, The Flash, Green Lantern and The Justice League of America.  "DC has lost a living legend this weekend and a true original," says Paul Levitz, DC's President & Publisher. "Julie was an editor who entertained and educated millions over three generations, performed the near-impossible feat of getting great work out of his contributors without ever ruffling their feelings, and taught many of us our craft. If the measure of an editor is the respect of his peers, he was immeasurable — for his peers who loved and respected him were often legends in their own right. Most of us were simply left in awe."

The documents include redacted inventories of items seized from Jackson's home and two other properties raided November 18. According to the below Neverland inventory, Santa Barbara Sheriff's deputies removed computers, legal documents, magazines, and a Canon digital camera found in Jackson's master bathroom. The court records, released by Superior Court Judge Rodney Melville, show that the material was taken from the 'main house' on the sprawling Los Olivos estate. Agents searched Jackson's master bedroom, where they took a 'note' found in a nightstand, and had to have a locksmith open the locked master bath (keys to the bathroom were apparently found later in a safe). The search warrant documents also include lists of items seized from the Beverly Hills office of Bradley Miller, a private investigator working for Jackson, and the L.A. home of Hamid Moslehi, a videographer who has worked for the so-called King of Pop. Melville, however, has refused to release the affidavit filed in support of the searches, a document that would provide a details of the prosecution's case against Jackson as well as the account provided to investigators by the teenage boy who has accused Jackson of molestation.

According to the below Phoenix Police Department report, when Farney spotted Simmons (whose real first name is Milton) walking through the Sky Harbor International Airport, he said, 'Look, Richard Simmons. Drop your bags, let's rock to the 50's.' Farney told cops he was referring to an old Simmons workout tape. The diminutive star responded by walking over to the strapping Farney and saying, 'It's not nice to make fun of people with issues.' He then slapped Farney's face. The motorcycle salesman, who was not injured, called cops, who cited an 'emotional' and repentant Simmons for assault."

The word itself can be traced to Creole and West African Bantu and the legend that a voodoo priest could hypnotize a corpse to obey his commands. In Hollywood's not-so-culturally-sensitive early zombie flicks, magically induced catatonia was featured more prominently than reanimation. Bela Lugosi's evil sorcerer 'Murder' Legendre hypnotizes Haitian sugar harvesters in White Zombie (1932) so that they grind cane into the wee hours without complaint. Jacques Tourneur's I Walked With a Zombie (1943) centers on a woman who's either the victim of island voodoo brainwashing or just really, really frigid and unresponsive."

Along with peddling overpriced apartments, Trump runs some spectacularly underperforming Atlantic City gambling joints. Trump's two trademark applications, which you'll find below, were made after the January 8 debut of 'The Apprentice,' the NBC hit that has thrust Trump (and the alleged billionaire's swirling hairdo) back onto the front pages. We're waiting to see if Trump tries to patent the signature hand motion he uses to dispatch 'Apprentice' contestants. On a related note, a check of trademark records shows that the firm 'You're Outsourced' is still available for the taking."

Having met Howard Devoto in 1977 as he was departing the Buzzcocks, McGeoch became a founding member of Magazine and many memorable riffs are featured on their first three albums Real Life, Secondhand Daylight and The Correct Use of Soap. By 1980 he was moonlighting with Visage and Siouxsie and the Banshees and went on to largely affect three of the latter's most lauded albums, Kaleidoscope, Juju and Kiss In The Dream House. In late 1982 McGeoch suffered a breakdown and was subsequently hospitalized and replaced in the Banshees by The Cure's Robert Smith. In the mid-80s he formed The Armoury Show with ex-members of The Skids, appeared on two solo debuts (Peter Murphy's Should The World Fail To Fall Apart and Matthew Sweet's Inside) and, finally, joined Public Image Limited. He became their longest serving member barring John Lydon and helped to re-invent Pil into a 'rock' band with Happy?, 9 and That What Is Not. By 1993 Pil dissipated and McGeoch returned to England from Los Angeles where he continued making music in various low key or unfinished projects. In 1995 he became a qualified nurse but chose not to follow the profession and lately had been writing music for television. John McGeoch is survived by partner Sophie and daughter Emily."

The 44-year-old Virginia man was arrested earlier this month and charged with felony criminal mischief for damaging a Motel 6 room in upstate New York. But Chamberlain, who has spent time on the pipe, wasn't breaking windows or throwing the television off the balcony. He was nabbed for slathering Vaseline on every single thing in Room 205--mattresses, pillows, sheets, furniture, carpeting, blankets, the TV, etc. A motel clerk discovered the damage after Chamberlain checked out and called the Broome County Sheriff's Office. When Deputy Kevin Smith arrived, the greasy m.o. rang a bell--a couple of weeks earlier a room at a nearby Super 8 was also apparently slimed by Chamberlain (though the owner declined at the time to press charges). A check of Room 205's trash turned up 14 empty containers of Vaseline, drug paraphernalia, cocaine residue, and porno magazines, 'which also were slathered/smeared with Vaseline,' according to a sheriff's report. Shortly after the Motel 6 damage was found on May 9, Chamberlain was arrested at--big surprise here--a nearby Econo Lodge. The arrestee, of course, was 'smeared from head to foot with Vaseline.' Ewww."

       urlLink A Failing Grade For "Friends" - May 12,   "Though 'Friends' would prove to be a lucrative ratings powerhouse, the sitcom's pilot received a failing grade and was described as 'not very entertaining, clever, or original,' according to an internal NBC research report obtained by The Smoking Gun. Months before the program's debut, 'Friends' was shown to test audiences that were 'not very favorable' to the show or its six main characters, according to the May 1994 report (a copy of which you'll find below). In fact, the pilot performance was graded 'weak' and scored a paltry 41 out of 100. By comparison, 'ER' scored a 91, though 'Seinfeld' famously also earned a 'weak' rating. While Courteney Cox's Monica fared best with test audience members, her appeal was 'well below desirable levels for a lead.' The characters portrayed by Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry had 'marginal appeal,' and 'Rachel, Ross, and Joey scored even lower.' A particularly stinging rebuke was delivered by adults 35 and over, who felt 'this group did not really care about each other the way real friends would. They found the characters smug, superficial, and self-absorbed.' TSG couldn't stand the show, so the brutal research analysis sounded pretty accurate to us--both then and now. However, considering the show's spectacular success during its 10-year run, the NBC report is merely an odd footnote to the 'Friends' success story."

According to the below federal criminal complaint, Jason Smathers, 24, last year illegally accessed the highly confidential AOL list by using another employee's identification codes. Smathers, who worked in AOL's Dulles, Virginia office, then allegedly sold the list to Sean Dunaway, who used the AOL database to promote his own online gambling business and who also sold the list for $52,000 to fellow spammers, one of whom used the names 'for purposes of marketing herbal penile enlargement pills,' according to the complaint. AOL's subscriber base is about 30 million individual customers, who account for 92 million different screen names. Prosecutors also contend that Smathers subsequently sold Hathaway an updated AOL customer list--this one with approximately 18 million names--for $100,000. Both men have been charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years. The Secret Service probe was aided by a spammer who purchased the two lists from Dunaway and is now seeking 'leniency concerning his/her participation' in the AOL conspiracy, notes the complaint."

      For all the Star Trek/Boston Public geeks...   urlLink Senate Race Sex Scandal   "JUNE 22--In what may prove a crippling blow to his U.S. Senate campaign, divorce records reveal that Illinois Republican Jack Ryan was accused by his former wife, actress Jeri Ryan, of pressuring her to have sex at swinger's clubs in New York, Paris, and New Orleans while other patrons watched. The bombshell allegation is contained amidst nearly 400 pages of records ordered released yesterday by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge who ruled on media requests to unseal documents from the Ryan case. The salacious charge leveled at the politician was made by Jeri Ryan, who has starred in TV's 'Star Trek: Voyager' and 'Boston Public,' in a court filing in connection with child custody proceedings (you'll find a portion of that heavily redacted September 2000 document below). The performer alleged that she refused Ryan's requests for public sex during the excursions, which included a trip to a New York club 'with cages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling.' While Ryan confirmed the trips with the actress, he described them simply as 'romantic getaways,' denying her claims that he sought public sex. The politician has repeatedly claimed that his divorce file--portions of which were sealed in 2000 and 2001--contained no embarrassing information that would harm his chances against Democratic nominee Barack Obama. The Ryans were married in 1991 and, in November 1998, Jeri Ryan filed for divorce citing 'irreconcilable differences.'"

Well, "Mary Sue" is an unkind term used to describe a certain kind of character, a style of writing. She (or he) is created to serve one purpose: wish fulfilment. When a writer invents someone through whom he/she can have fantastic adventures and meet famous people (fictional or real), this character is a Mary Sue. (We don't have a name for the male version -- suggestions?)  Although storytellers have been rehashing Mary Sue since the dawn of time, she did not receive her current name until the early 1970s. The original was Lieutenant Mary Sue ('the youngest Lieutenant in the fleet -- only fifteen and a half years old') as immortalized in Paula Smith's 'A Trekkie's Tale,' which she wrote and published in her 1974 fanzine Menagerie #2. (According to Katherine Langley: 'Paula is still active in fandom and, to be sure, suitably bemused that Mary Sue lives on.')"

The 33-year-old Long Island man is facing grand larceny and forgery charges for a scheme to swindle car dealerships out of pricey SUVs. According to cops, Fenderson last month passed bogus certified checks at two Cadillac dealerships, walking away with a pair of $65,000 Escalades. When the checks bounced, the dealers ran to Nassau County cops, who yesterday nabbed Fenderson, who was at the wheel of one of the Cadillacs when placed in cuffs. However, had the car salesmen looked more closely at Fenderson's checks they would have realized there was a problem with the paper. Along with misspelling 'Roosevelt,' his own hometown, Fenderson had trouble correctly rendering 'Chase Manhattan Bank.' Below you'll find one of those bogus 65k checks, passed at a Freeport dealership last month.

       urlLink The Sultan Brought Cheesecake   "AUGUST 4--Three hundred pounds of lamb. A $12,000 Franck Muller watch. Christian Dior after-shave lotion. A Lady McDuffies gourmet lemon cheesecake. Those are just a few of the fabulous gifts received last year by the Bush family from foreign leaders, according to a list released this week by the Department of State's Office of Protocol (below you'll find excerpts from the 52-page report). It will probably come as no surprise that the most valuable gift came from Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdallah, who gave First Lady Laura Bush a matching set of diamond and sapphire jewelry valued by U.S. officials at $95,500. The Saudi royal also gave the president an $8500 mantel clock and the 'first family' (that would be first daughters Jenna and Barbara) received Bulgari necklaces valued at $8500 and $8000 apiece. Other recipients of Saudi largesse were Chief of Staff Andrew Card and national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, both of whom got small daggers priced at $1500. The foreign gifts are taken, the State Department report notes, since 'non-acceptance would cause embarrassment to donor and U.S. Government.' However, in most cases, the items are turned over the National Archives for safekeeping. As for the lamb cache, we're guessing it was served to First Mutt Barney."

       urlLink Aeon Flux -- The Movie   "Charlize Theron, who will play the title SF superhero in  Aeon Flux , told SCI FI Wire that she is currently rehearsing with director Karyn Kusama and her co-stars in the live-action movie, which is based on the animated MTV series. Shooting begins in mid-August, but Theron is still getting to know the character, she said in an interview. 'I've just spent five days with the director and the cast, so we're still sort of working that out,' Theron said. 'It's not just a special-[effects movie]. It's a love story, of course, so those are the things that kind of get me going.'"
