      Right...so why should I be complaining about my birthday. I mean gosh, I got a diamond ring..my ex remembered my bday when he didn't have to, my next door neighbor's remembered, my cousin remembered...frank and zeke remembered...But my friend forgot that this weekend was my bday and that we had talked about going to the races. He thought I was telling him about my bday party next weekend...that it started at 8. So I spend more than an hour crying over something THAT freaking stupid! The one year they fall on my bday and i cry over it because i can't go. I couldn't help it, i mean i've been looking forward to this since...i forgot when, like 4 months ago?! Bye  Nina

      OMG OMG OMG the concert was so freaking awesome. I was not even 2 feet from Rick Springfield! Thanks to CSE, i wouldn't have been that close if it weren't for him. And DURN IT. I was stupid and didn't think this but I could've recorded the concert on my blog. DURN IT! *hits head repeatedly* Perfect ending to a perfect night!!! I saw the guy from Cracker Barrell *smiles and blushes* But dude this concert was WAY freaking better than the Papa Roach concert. nothing was compared to it. Thanks CSE for pushing me closer...but i'm still mad at you, for 3 reasons  1.) You didn't catch the shirt that went over your head 2.) You didn't make me touch Rick Springfield 3.) ...and I forgot the 3rd, but there was a third, right now i'm talking to ashley so I forgot, but i'll remember soon!  But I still wuv ya :-D. lol. We gotta do this more. Not concerts, but you know you know, something cool. There's Funtrackers next week! You better go! Or I'll hurt you so freaking bad hehehe. *smiles evily*  ~*~Nina~*~  P.S. People forgot! It's my bday and people have forgot only Zeke and Frank have told me happy bday, and I think CSE too. BYE

      this is for friends of mine like...Brandon, and maybe David... I didn' t read it so I can't rate it, but I think they might like it, and so would you, and I promise, this is my LAST entry for today probably, if I don't go to sleep early that is...  1.  You refer to going to the bathroom as downloading.  2.  You step out of your room and realize that your parents have moved and you don't have a clue as to when it happened.  3.  Your bookmark takes 15 minutes to go from top to bottom.  4.  Your nightmares are in HTML and GIFS.  5.  You turn off your modem and get this awful empty feeling, like you just pulled the plug on a loved one.  6.  You start introducing yourself as "Jim at net dot com"  7.  Your heart races faster and beats irregularly each time you see a new WWW site address on TV.  8.  You turn on your intercom when leaving the room so you can hear if new e-mail arrives.  9.  Your wife drapes a blond wig over your monitor to remind you of what she looks like.  10.  All of your friends have an @ in their names.  11.  When looking at a web page full of someone else's links, you notice all of them are already highlighted in purple.  12.  Your dog has its own home page.  13.  You can't call your mother... She doesn't have a modem.  14.  You check your mail. It says "no new messages." So you check it again.  15.  Your phone bill is a heavy as a brick.  16.  You write your homework in HTML and give your instructor the URL.  17.  You don't know the sex of three of your closest friends, because they have neutral nicknames and you never bothered to ask.  18.  Your husband tells you that he has had the beard for 2 months.  19.  You wake up at 3 a.m. to go to the bathroom and stop and check your e-mail on the way back to bed.  20.  You tell the kids they can't use the computer because "Daddy's got work to do" -- even though you don't have a job.  21.  You buy a Captain Kirk chair with a built-in keyboard and mouse.  22.  Your wife makes a new rule: "The computer cannot come to bed."  23.  You get a tattoo that says "This body best viewed with Netscape 3.0 or higher."  24.  You never have to deal with busy signals when calling your ISP... because you never log off. 25.  The last girl you picked up was only a GIF.  26.  You ask a plumber how much it would cost to replace the chair in front of your computer with a toilet.  27.  Your wife says communication is important in a marriage... so you buy another computer and install a second phone line so the two of you can chat.  28.  As your car crashes through the guardrail on a mountain road, your first instinct is to search for the "back" button.

      This joke was...well let's see, it was totally meant for the kids that could think it up, and adults would find it to where they couldn't understand it... 4 out of 10   Be sure you lock your doors and windows at home.  It was reported in the news that a man was found murdered in his home over the weekend. Detectives at the scene found the man face down in his bath tub.  The tub had been filled with milk and corn flakes, and a banana was sticking out of his butt.  Police suspect a cereal killer.

      I found another joke, this one made me almost cry laughing, since it was a little more disturbing than the other, I'd rate it a 9 out of 10:   Once upon a time, there was a guy sunbathing in the nude. He saw a little girl coming towards him, so he covered himself with the newspaper he was reading. The girl came up to him and asked "What do you have under the newspaper, mister?"  "A bird," the guy replied. The little girl walked away and the guy fell asleep.  When he woke up, he was in a hospital in tremendous pain. When the Police asked him what happened, the guy replied, "I don't know. I was lying on the beach, this girl asked me about my privates, and the next thing I know is I'm here."  Police went back to the beach, found the girl, and asked her "What did you do to that naked fellow?"  After a little pause, the girl replied, "To him? Nothing. I was playing with the bird and it spit on me, so I broke its neck, cracked its eggs, and set its nest on fire."

      i thought I'd share something before I leave class, I find this DISTURBINGLY funny, so here you guys go:   A man was sitting on a plane reading a book.  A few minutes later he ran up to the pilot and said, "Help! Help! I dropped my favorite book out of the plane! Can you please stop it?"  "No, no, I am not stopping this plane for a book.", the pilot replied.  Later another man ran up to the pilot and asked, "Can please land the plane?  I dropped my lucky baseball."  "No, I will not land the plane for a baseball!!!"  A third man had dropped a gernade out of the plane.  He quick ran up the the pilot and started yelling, "Stop, stop, I lost my gern-"  "Alright, Alright!", he interupts.  "I will land the plane."  When the pilot got out he saw two little boys crying.  He asked them what was the matter, they replied something fell out of the sky and landed on them.  One was a book and the other a baseball.  A third boy came along and was laughing.  The pilot asked, "What are you laughing about?"  "I farted and my house blew up!"

      Hiya peeps who are reading this.  I'm bored right now, like you needed to know that but I felt like you did so I just did.  (I know that was very confusling, but hey I'm confusling!)  Someone's playing Faith Hill's new cd, and it's on my favorite cd rite now.  :).  MAN the school's pizza is gross, but what's new?  It's always dripping w/ grease and it's all orangish-red, which REALLY makes it grosser, why couldn't it just be clear?  OH wait, just because of the pepperoni of course.  GRR, I hate being the 'little one' to get picked on all the time, especially since I'm short.  Not that I could pass for a TOTAL miget because there are people shorter than me, only a select few though.   Today during lunch my friend David decided to play w/ my hair saying it "Turned him on" so I told Jeremy that HIS hair turned David on and David goes "I don't swing that way, but I know Nina does" and I was like WHAT?! because I thought he was saying something ELSE (if some people know what I mean).  OKIES, well I'm gonna go because I'm really bored, so therefore, I'm going to... urlLink "The place where you go to when you're bored!" .

      Hey I'm just here rite now, messing around w/ the blog while i'm at school.    Tiny bit of news today: My teacher now thinks I'm "too smart" for her class.  Today and for the past few days, I've been finishing my work first in class, no intentions, just because the work is easy.  Well today I turn in my work and the teacher calls me up and goes "You don't belong in this class do you"... and I just stared at her, and she said "How come you didn't sign up for a Reading Honors class?" and I shrugged, then "Well I think you should go into an honors class, because this class is just too easy for you it seems.  Do you have an honors class?", "yes", "what is it?", "Biology". "Well you know there is a Reading honors class next door... Would you want to try that out for about a week, see how that goes?"  ..." I don't know... I guess?", "OK, starting next Monday we'll see if we can get you into that class, I'll talk to the teacher this week"  "OKAY".  Then of course I sit down.  But the nerve that she should suggest me going into Reading honors?!  I'm not smart, it's just all this stuff we're doing is EASY.  Besides, I can only stand one honors class a semester, I learned that last semester of the school year... *no comment*.  To make matters worse, this teacher I will end up going into her class... She hates me!  One time while waiting outside for 3rd lunch shift to start, I had been playing around and kicked my shoe at this one guy, we were really bored.  She came out and told me in an irritated voice "I am trying to teach a class here, would you PLEASE settle down?!".  So of course I did.  Then 2 months ago my mom asked me if I had this one teacher, and I go no why? and she goes "because she said she knew you and goes 'That's your daughter?' when she was in my office, she said it like she knew you, and really wasn't fond of you"... I told mom the whole story, and she goes "NO WONDER".  So truly, I'm not looking forward to this shift in classes, and I should just tell the teacher that, maybe she'll understand, I should tell her my mind can only process so much at a time and not go into another honors class, I'm probably, WITHOUT A DOUBT, going to fail my Biology Honors class!.. OKIES, well i better go, I said too much, CIAO

      9:37 PM 1/28/2003 	To start off my new journal/news website... I must actually say Brandon...I'm sorry I'm taking the idea from you, I just can't think of what to do w/ this...so I'm just going to make this a journal.  	Starting things off, I'll just go w/ the thing that REALLY annoyed me today: 	I called my friend (not to be named, for I don't know if he'd get mad.)  I had asked him about his computer saying about all the phone numbers on the computer and stuff saying "..Glad your computer messed up that time while I was giving you my address, now u don't know where I live".  He cut me off and said that everything on his computer was GONE.  I asked why and stuff, and he said that the one time his SIBLING (no specifics) downloaded some *"unnecessary stuff"* (get the picture?), that him and his brother-in-law never got around to deleting all the stuff.  So when his step-grandparents came to move in w/ them for a few weeks, and had to stay in the computer room, they went on the computer (before saying they didn't want it in the room) and went and looked at files and stuff, and found all the *"unnecessary stuff"* that the SIBLING had downloaded.  Well, they mentioned it at dinner one night, and my friend was like "uh huh, ok" and kept on eating... So they decided to delete EVERYTHING on the computer that was downloaded, EVEN the phone numbers and stuff on the address book.  His mom and step-dad told him he couldn't download anything (music games and stuff) and they even deleted Kazaa all together.  	I think it's stupid, because HELLO they should make it to where Kazaa and all those "music and PIC" systems to where it's not as EASILY accessible for kids about 11-12 (how old SIBLING is), to download porn and stuff.  It's pretty stupid that one person should get punished for one SIBLING's actions.  When the parents don't even know the ENTIRE TRUTH.  WHich I must add has happened to me, and I HATE IT!  	On a happier note (and funny), today while walking home, I learned MY BEST FRIEND does not know the difference in a boy and girl cat... AS IN not knowing how to tell between a boy and a girl.  While we were walking home, we heard this cat meowing REALLY loud and so I saw the cat and go "here kitty kitty" and it ran toward me.  I was going to pet it and leave it, but then I saw that it was a CROSSED-Eyed cat, which I cannot feel anything but sympathy for a cat w/ cross-eyes for I don't know what reason.  The cat runs up to my friend and she's like "Get the **** away from me, go away, SHOO" so like the cat runs in front of us... (before this all came up, I had drank a WHOLE 20 oz. D.P. in 5 minutes) the cat...well... let's just say "big balls?" was running and I saw THOSE, and started laughing, and Erica was like WHAT?! and I couldn't quit laughing, I was on the verge of crying and falling over.  Then she saw what I saw and goes asking "What's that?!" and kept on asking, but everytime I tried answering, I just started laughing again.  Then finally when the cat went away and we were near the corner of the street, I go "BIG BALLS!" and she goes "Those what those were?!" so I started laughing again, and she was laughing, and goes "I was about to say... Are those, what I think they are?".    	OKAY so my journal on it's first day was kinda long, and probably REALLY BORING, don't worry, it won't be as long as this, I promise, so as they say in Spanish "Hasta Luego!" (I'm just stupid for adding that, don't ask me why I added that!)

      Is it possible to humiliate someone so bad, her pants would stick to the chair?  Well then... let's just see.  I'll bring superglue to school, and I'll get my friend to put it on this girl's chair, and see what happens.  Hopefully she'll be humiliated by when she gets up, her pants'll stick to the chair.  Then I must spread rumors about her crush on a 6th grader from last year.  How cool is that?  It's cool enough for me.  COOLO!   Ahh my nail hurts, FREAK IT.  I can't say things out loud, I must say them here.  I love the moon, cuz it is very close to us.  I dont know why that came out, but it did.  OKIES, well let's see.... Why did the chicken cross the road?  Beacuse it wanted to be sexed up that's what I think... but maybe here's what some other people think  urlLink Why did the Chiken...Cross the road?  Maybe that'll clear up the confusion.

I hate when alex comes over, he always hits on me.... like here's how it went: he came over and asked if I could come outside, so yeah I went outside, and we were talkign then he suggested going on the brick-wall, so we went and sat on it, we were sitting a good foot-1/2 and then somehow he started getting closer and then he goes "you don't hug me anymore" so he put his arm around my shoulder, then he goes That wasn't really a hug, so I gave him a hug, ya ya ya, then he started putting his arm around my waist, then he put his hand on my knee, and grabbed my hand, then he kissed my cheek, and I was starting to kinda feel a little uncomfortable, I don'tk now, then he goes "can I have a kiss?" and I shook my head, and he goes why? you kissed michael, is there something wrong w/ me? and I go NO, and he goes are you sure? and I go yeah, and he goes "are u starting to feel uncomfortable?" and I nodded, so then he backed off  it's just weird around him... i dunno, well anywayz, that's pretty much everything that happened, I'm gonna go now, buhbye!

      Hey people, I'm out of the downs now, people are talking to me, my friend that got the letter, we talked, my other friend's talking to me, it's all good.  I'm breaking up w/ my b/f, DAMN can I just make up my mind already?!  this'll be the 2nd time, and the 2nd time I break up w/ him, but I can't do it myself... so much for my LOUD-MOUTH  Highlight of YESTERDAY, since it's only 3 in the morning:    I saw They.  It was okay, it was weird.  Not a good scary movie, it didn't really make sense.  But it did make me jump a couple times.  It wasn't as good as The Ring though, now THAT was a badass movie.     I get my way on some things, I had gone to Wal-Mart and my mom picked up this "Good-luck bamboo" thing, it curls up when it grows.  I wanted one, but they were like all dead.  So I got mad, and was like GRR MOM! I want one.  So she was like well lets go to the Trade center place.  We went the place that sold them was closed.  SO my mom went to the Asian Market, we found one  there, but I doubt they'll curl up and twist together.   My turtle hates me, he bites me, he tries to bite me when he's in the cage.  He eats huge fish, eats crickets.  Now does that sound like a small turtle to u?  Well he's only a little bigger than a silver-dollar coin, that I think... He's ALSO ticklish.  What kind of turtle is ticklish?!  I guess MINE.    My Spanish teacher is starting to get to know the REAL me.  I'm opening up more in class, I get hyper more often, and she wants to move me to the front of the class cuz I'm quiet.  I'm NOT QUIET!  Only to teachers... around my friends, They WANT to put the duct tape on my fact.  Friday I kept on framing Jose, and he caught me red-handed stealing his backpack.  Then the teacher saw me laughing and heard me, and goes "Is that Nina talking? and laughing?" and Andrea goes "I told u miss she's not quiet!  Shy my butt!! She's freaking loud!"  and the teacher goes "Now Andrea, don't go talking about your anatomy in this class, it's only spanish class" Louie's stupid, instead of calling him Herpes, like david started... We're now going to call him "Pes-Her" Herpes backwards, in a way.  it does kinda sound like "please her" doesn't it?  or is it just me? damn I need a guestbook badly...  John David's weird, Marcel's gay....only in May.  Erica likes... SOMEONE and I know who!  David's crazy, Brandon's a dork,  all michael's turn out to be jerks in the end, i learned that.  There are too many Chris's, Michael's, Alex's, Justin's, got a name? email me! well I've given out enough "useful" information for now... Im tired, me go to bed.  EMAIL ME! P.S. I like N.O.S. get that?

Everyone's mad at me, I have a feeling I lost a friend, well it was her opinionating (real word?) that got me so mad I wrote her this mean letter...My friends aren't talking to me, others think I'm stupid.  I guess I'm just stupid is that it?  I'm not in the mood to talk now, so bye, email me if you have anything to say teenieiskutie@juno.com BYE BYE, I'll go in the tub and throw soap on the wall now, or at least at the mirror to cover my face

      Man can you say I'm BLONDE?!  Today the bell rang early, and before I could get called back downstairs I ran all the way up to the 3rd floor, my arm flew up, and well... I was holding my pencil and the pencil went RITE behind my ear and scratched it, I put my finger behind my ear, and I was bleeding, I HATE BLEEDING!  So I started shaking when my friend saw me, and she was like ARE you okay?! and I was like I'm bleeding, eww, and so she looked behind my ear and said it looked Gross.  WEll that's about that  today, I was on a TOTAL Sugar high, and it was pretty bad if I made my Health teacher mad enough to yell at me.  then I started banging my head at lunch.  And this girl is a total biter.  some short girl, shorter than michael, which is pretty short.  She had the same shirt as me!  I was wearing that shirt today!  I was so mad, I was like GRR, so to keep people from saying I was being the biter, I wore my jacket all through lunch.  MAN nobody can call me a biter, because I've had this shirt since the beginning of the school year.    I gotz A-B honor roll.  :D I'm so happy for myself!  What an accomplishment.  OKIES, well I must copy 3 cds before I go to bed, so I must go now, nite nite and BUHBYE!!! CIAS

      OK, forget all the mean things I said 'bout Michael, I'm over all that now.  Why is it I have dreams.... BUT can't remember them, is it cuz I'm not so interested in remembering them?  OR I'm just too lazy to hang onto the last thoughts of those dreams?  I must ponder upon this.  J.D., you're the homeskillet.  Hey Toma, you shouldn't be letting your sister watch the Weebl & Bob videos, they're too MUCH for a 10 year old girl!   Well I'm bored, must go watch my Weebl & Bob shows, PIE!

      Why is it that EVERY teacher thinks that calling ur parents is good for you?  All they're doing is getting you in trouble!  They think "Oh Mr. *bleeted* or Mrs. *bleeted*, your son/daughter is failing, would u mind doing something about it?" in my case it was "Mr. *bleeted* (so as not to say my name), I'm concerned about your daughter.  She has failed to take 4 AR tests so far she only has 1, she's failing at a 6th grade reading level.  I'm hoping you can talk to her about this, and maybe straighten out the problem."  Then dad said she said he should consider putting me into the honors so I DO my homework!  It's like... HELLOW lady people don't like reading, at least I don't!  I don't wanna read, that's why it shows my reading level so low, I could make it higher if I set my mind to it.  So those 'teachers' think they are doing u a favor in informing your parents on ur low grades, NO they're helping on getting you in trouble I think, I'll get to the reading, it's not like I'll LET myself fail that stupid class, if u DARE put me in the honors class I fail on purpose, and then make my dad take me to summer school, that's a FACT!  My retaliation against you if u dare do that to me!    On a happier note, I've been truly improving  urlLink my webpage greatly.  It's going good, I've gotten a chat installed in it, got pictures up, and smack like that.  OKIES, well I'ma go because I'm tired, I only gotz 3 hours of sleep yesterday!  BYE BYE

      NOW I definetely know I wasn't imagining things.  A while back, I was sitting on the stairs, waiting for the library to open.  I heard this whistling then this loud singing.  A guy.  And it wasn't just you know, maybe Elvis impersonations, or Michael Jackson wannabe.  This was not any English music.  To me it sounded something like maybe Italian.  Well, I dismissed it, thinking I was just hallucinating, or imaginging things.  Today, I was sitting on the stairs again, someone was a few steps up from me.  I heard it again.  It was loud, then descended, like walking away.  About more than 5 minutes later, there was this guy I saw in the reflection of the glass door on the library, and then there was this loud singing, the same stuff.  I was like EEK, I just stared off like OK?  Then he was walking closer and was still singing.  Then he was walking out, there was this boy walking around him and he looked at me and started smiling, I had like this big frightened look on my face like "GET me out of here, this guy is crazy, he's scaring me" the boy was just laughing, he looked at the guy, and laughed.  AND I thought I was going crazy, I mean, that's just weird, this guy is the cutodian that's singing.    That is all for now, I have nothing to talk about because this is just the morning.

      Gosh, I really haven't noticed, but the way I eat peppermint represents how I am.  Just think, I'm impatient.  Well You know how most people suck on the peppermint, enjoying the taste.  Me, I can't stand to wait for it to be melted or dissolved, or whatever it does.  i just bite it and then get another 1, and by the end of the day I'd be done w/ a whole bag of peppermints.  but then, I hate it when the peppermint's all chewed up, and it gets stuck in your teeth.  That's the bad thing about it.  I go nite nite now, because I'm really tired, I'll write tomorrow hopefully BYE!

      OKAY, I've had my friend Toma complaining that I haven't written in a while, so here I am.  I'm totally bored  Well to get things started, the news on April Fool's day (almost a whole week I know, but I dont care).  I played the same trick on 2 of my teachers.  I put tape under their mouses.  NOW I had my Biology teacher wondering all the way through class, then I finally admitted it, and she didn't seem as mad as I thought she was going to be.  My Spanish teacher on the other hand, I didn't get a chance to lead her on because, JOSE, decided to snitch me out.  She threatened to give me 3 0s, but never did.  Luckily, I didn't have any tricks played on me.  Not that I remember....  Current events:  Saturday.. I was so stupid, I had to mow the lawn.  I think I over did it because I flooded the lawn mower trying to restart it, and when it wouldn't restart I kicked the nearest thing.  Well it turned out to be 1 of those metal things u ride your car up on to make it higher, and I kicked the edge of the metal part.  I started yelling at that thing, and the lawn mower and went to sit by the car.  Now, i have a bruise on my ankle, which REALLY hurts... Saturday..AGAIN, I went to the car races, they finally started!  Well turns out, the guy that liked me last summer, still likes me.  But I won't give him the time of day (or however u say it) because he's too young for me, he's only 11 or 12, and what am I?! I'm 14 for crying out loud.  I'd rather go out w/ guys older than me...Thank you very much.    That's pretty much it, besides... My life's boring, you wouldn't want to know anymore, so I must go now! BUHBYE!!!

But the person blocked me before I had the chance to say something back, that's not fair!

      AHH I'm finally going to put stuff, I haven't done this thing in like FOREVER.  Well anyways, found a couple of funny things when i went out of town, said a funny thing too, well anyways....  When we were leaving kenedy a very disturbing sign popped up: 'Thanks - N- Come Again' When we were on our way to San Marcos Savanna had been getting me mad, well she asked "Mom, what does nurse mean?" so I decided to tell her "Here's an example: When I'm done kicking your ass, someone will have to nurse you back to health." everyone started laughing, except savanna of course.  Mom said I was evil Today at Schlitterbahn, some people decided to give my mom attitude, be rude, act a bitch.  SO when they were gone mom goes "go get the salt from the car" I came back, and gave it back to her.  These people had a box of donuts, and so my mom popped the top off the salt and poured it into the donuts.  Luckily salt looks like sugar, these people hopefully fell for it.  What's the worst of it, mom talked about it in front of them.  Well I think that's pretty much it...so, i'll go, bye bye

So he pops off w/ "See we're not so different after all."

      Listening to: Bowling for Soup - Baby one more time Current thoughts: I'm bored, and talkative Mood: amused in thought Notes (sorry toma, i like ur idea): No. 1 - Even though dolphins live in water, they are not, I repeat, ARE NOT, fish..no arguments!  I had fun today, went out of town.  My little cousin, trying to wrestle w/ me as usual (wrestling fanatic).  I broke his little mo-ped/scooter thingy lol, only the seat though.  I was amused, the first time I went on it, I lost control cause the little handle that speeds it up was speeding the scooter up and I went into the grass, then the next thing you know I hear little barking.  A little puppy was barking and chasing me!  That made me lost control even more, and I had to turn and I ran right into a pothole or w/e manhole or something?  The thing that was holding the charger in the back of the scooter popped up.  Then I ran the scooter back to the house, and they told me a bolt popped out of the seat.  So they spent like 20-30 minutes trying to fix that thing.  When it was fixed, I killed the battery going back and forth down the street.  That was the end of THAT.

      Listening to: Cake - Walk on By Current thoughts: random things Mood: idle    I was thinking...while passing by Ocean dr.  how naive I was when I was little.  There are these benches along Ocean dr. and there are 2 back to back, one faces the water, one faces the street.  I used to think "How could people sit on the benches facing the water if it drops off to the water?" When I got older, I found out that there are steps on the other side of the benches, then there's the water.  I thought my past thoughts a result of never being taken to these benches when I was little, for me to have such thoughts.     I also thought while passing Sunset Bay on the way to Portland the thoughts I had when I was little.  When it was summer, and lots of water from Sunset Bay had evaporated there were more islands than there are now, seeing as it's not hot enough.  And On those little islands there would be BIG I mean HUGE congregations of birds on those islands.  I remember I used to tell my uncle "Look, all those birds are getting together, and they're going to attack all us people."  I still haven't figured out yet what those birds were doing, and probably will be doing summers from now, but I WILL figure that out!

      Listening to: Bowling For Soup - Punk Rock 101 Current thoughts: random things Mood: tested    I'm trying to get my mind off Christmas.  Oh yea, yesterday, I did something stupid.  I locked my door, forgetting the keys in the room.  Since I hid my other key to the room, well...let's just say "BREAK IN TIME!".  My mom had to drill into the doorknob, breaking one drillbit, the second one was too big to go into the hole.  And as they say "Third time's a charm" the 3rd drill bit broke the doorknob.  So for my bit of stupidity, I have a broken lock (doorknob surprisingly works, just can't lock it).  What did I learn?? DON'T HIDE THE SPARE KEY and...Don't leave the keys in the room!

      Listening to: Blink182 - First Date Current thoughts: I'm drowsy...and tired....and...*snore*  Thoughts basically describe my day..I fell asleep in gym class.  I did get stuck on the monkey bars after school.  I had help to get on by my OTHER friend Dustin and climbed on top.  But then I got scared and didn't want to climb down.  Finally I jumped down, and some guy passing by goes "Wow that would've been perfect if you had just landed it, it would've been PERFECT" and Nicole goes "OOOoooOOOhhh U got urself an admirer" Crazy Nicole.  Then me and her were walking and she stuffed the Santa hat on my head and it went over my eyes, so for a few seconds I was reaching out trying to walk w/out tripping, and then I hear a voice in my ear going "That's very cute" and I pulled the hat up and it was my friend from last year Edward.  When we were walking to get picked up by my mom I saw this guy Robert from 1 of my classes last year, and I go HEY and he sees me and he goes "Hey girl what's up? *hug* haven't seen u around" and then when we said bye Nicole goes "Gosh Nina u gots lots of guys after u" HAHA Nicole, just cuz guys say hi to me, doesn't mean they like me.

      Listening to- Why Can't I - Liz Phair Current thoughts- Pickle flavored chips are addicting...  This girl comes up to me and my friends during P.E asking if we could be interviewed: she first asks Dustin Girl: So what do u do during lunch? Dustin: Uhh...hang out w/ friends, talk to my girlfriend and draw Girl: What do u draw? random things or things u see around school? Dustin: Random things, stuff on net and stuff Girl: What else do u like doing in school? Dustin: Like I said, drawing and stuff...and rite now I'm really amused watching Nina burn her makeup- Girl: U mean her eyeliner rite? Dustin: NO, random makeup, she burned her lipgloss, only to realize that she burned the plastic and can't snap the lid back on the container because it messed up. Girl: *laugh* Ok *talks to Ashley* What do U do during lunch? Ashley: I uh...eat and hang out w/ friends. Girl: anything else? Ashley: I like plotting revenge against people Girl: *laugh* revenge against who? Friends, enemies? Ashley: people that get me mad, and friends, hold up are you going to put this in the newspaper under our names and stuff?  Ur not gong to say I plot revenge are you? Girl: No no, I'm just asking more cuz i think it's funny *laugh* you plotting revenge against people Ashley: *laugh* Ok good, cuz i don't want people all coming up to me "Are you going to plot something against me if I said ur ugly?" *laugh*  Weird stuff, she interviewed me, but i said same as Dustin, except the girlfriend part and...the drawing, seeing as how I can't draw.  It was true about the burning my makeup, I burned my plum lipgloss, bored and I wanted to see what it would do.  Turns out, it gets really hot, I put my finger in it, and it burned for like...a second I guess.  But while I burned it I saw smoke, and I looked at the container, it was caved in a bit.  Looks like I went a little overboard.  I wanted to see what would happen if I burned cotton, and I did, it turned into a ball of fire, and I stomped on it, since we were in the gym and on concrete it wouldn't do much and it didn't, just a little brown mark where it burned.

      Today, I went to...NO school that's for sure.  Staying up til 4 in the morning and then waking up at 7:30 doesn't help either.  I went to a memorial service for a dear friend of mine, hate when i get emotional *stomps*.  Then we went to the store, Target, and I saw this cute shirt:  The Stages of Santa: 1)U believe in Santa 2)U believe Santa is fake 3)U dress like Santa 4)U look like Santa  Then we went to a Christmas store, I bought my friend and her family some gifts, but in case she sees this I won't say waht they are, cuz i have to mail them to her and want them to be a surprise.  I saw this OH SO AWESOME stuff, called  urlLink Sno-Wonder .  And I bought some...but it came out to be a total disaster, instead of the nice white fluffy snow it was supposed to turn out into it became a messy slush taht'll never turn to liquid or turn into it's final destination, SNOW!  I did the directions wrong, or just put too much water....well anyways i'll just bug my mom to buy more on the net so i can mess around w/ it.  LaterZ!

Though I have my little sister trying to say I was on the computer last night, when I wasn't.  How could I have been, my keyboard clicking is loud enough and she would've heard the mouse clicking, she has super-sonic ears it seems.   Well anyways, I'm getting tired of trying to hint to Spenser I want him to go to Favorites, it's getting close, 1 week until the dance and I don't have a freaking date.  I have Nicole telling me that Spenser likes me, which is totally bogus because no guy likes me, it's crazyness.  She also has Kelly thinking this too.  They both think that 'Smiles' likes me because everytime he passes by me he smiles really big and waves to me and then I end up smiling really big because I know that I had a crush on him last year.  It's a freaking conspiracy!  They're teaming up on me.  The evil little monkey trolls (don't ask)are teaming up on me!   OK well anyways, I'm gonna go because Monica and Mike are scaring me, they're hugging and stuff (no kissing though) but STILL I get scared of mushy stuff, at least I think so.

I went to the Puddle of Mudd concert last night, and I ACTUALLY got to see the band singing because Bear picked me up on his shoulders.  I saw my uncle there, getting all goggled over because he looks like Jack Osbourne.  Some guy tried to get me to kiss him!  DUDE that's sick.   Tuesday would have been my dad's birthday..Yeah.  I got Duck Hunt and Mario Brothers!  DAMN that dog that makes fun of me for missing a duck.  I was so durned close to killing Jaws!  But NOOOO the spear had to freaking miss him.  Well anyways, I need to go, school's about to start, just thought I'd post.  In the words of Joseph "LaterZ!"  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: talking and talking and talk.... Current thoughts: DUDE....oh wait I forgot Mood: bored  JAWS IS FREAKING P-O-ING ME OFF!!!!  I had Jaws down to almost 10 power lines, and I was doing freaking good until damn baby jaws come in doubles after me and surround me and kill me!!!  I Shall AVENGE.    Day 4: I'm at school, no caffeine, I'm not acting weird.  But maybe people are looking at me weird.  I wanted to break this vow yesterday, since we went to the movies.  But then I found out, I could have Sprite!!  It has no caffeine, and that stuff makes me burp as much as D.P. ever has.  Now that I haven't had any caffeine like I said before, things are easier to addict to.  I drink water in less than 5 minutes.  This whole weekend I drank more than 2 qts. of grapefruit juice.  CUP after CUP after CUP.  It was crazy.    **To be Continued**  I had the weirdest dream last night, but only one thing stuck in my head.  There were 2 people that I remembered most, Josh and David.  Josh was the therapist and David was talking to him.  He told Josh that I was stalking him....I'm NOT!  What is my subconciousness trying to tell me??  People are staring at me I must cease for now.

      Listening to: Reel Big Fish - Why Can't We Be Friends Current thoughts: if I go through this vow what will I get? Mood: hyper New MY Word(s): shi-oh-wha-no he doesn't (only me and Nicole know this, we were talking about Spenser)  Today, I shall start my vow of NO coke (the drink, all colas u know like, orange soda, coke, dr pepper, all that crap)  Day 1: It's been....2 days of no coke, but today I'm officially starting, I've survived off pickle chips and Twister, it's good.  But I fear of the day I run out of those chips because then I'll start going mad.  Mom doesn't go to Sams only like once a month it seems.  Last time I did this vow it was only 5 days, then I went into the country/ranchland, and I gave up because there was no water.  I can't have chocolate either.....that's sad.  I'll go crazy in 3 days tops i'm sure, I'll be posting later on, to tell how my vow is going of course to let you people know how I'm going.  BYE!  There, my journal entry on my vow for the day.  YES I'm vowing off coke, coffee, chocolate, all that good stuff.  I've survived so far, let's see how long it'll take for Nina to go crazy.  OH GOSH I'm going crazy, I'm talking in the 3rd person!  NO!!!  It's already happening!!!! *screams*  **To be continued**  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: teachers talking, people talking, keyboards, NO MUSIC! Current thoughts: Some song is circling its way around my head, I have no thoughts. Mood: happy  So I hinted to him yesterday that I was going to Favorites.  He doesn't know if he's going... But hey Chris I DID IT!  So cheer for me, haha.  Nicole thinks me and him are going to get together, it's the second day I've hung out with him during lunch.  WHAT is it a rule you can't sit with a guy during lunch or something??  DARN I didn't get his watch again, oh whatever, I'll get it again, probably not today seeing as how it's a weekend and a guy can never go more than a day without his watch it seems, because they're always looking at their hand.  It's so fun playing I WIN, though he's always saying he wins and I don't.    WELLLL I found out Marcus had a girlfriend last night which means Nicole can't hang all over him, even though I've never seen her at this school.  I went to a play last night, "Little Shop of Horrors".  YES Horrors, not WHORES, lol.  It was OK for a musical, the people could sing good if you ask me.  The characters were funny.  And the plant, HILARIOUS.  ONLY because I know something that only me and someone else know, and it's pretty funny/bad at the same time.    I'm going to be at my grandmother's house this weekend, soooo no updates until school starts I guess.  But it's all good, it's fun...But this is the first weekend I've gone to her house without taking my little gerbil Pecan :(.  I always take her when I go, but seeing as how I can't take a gerbil to school..I guess she'll just have to wait until Sunday.    LaterZ peeps, keep commenting and I'll write back Monday!  *~*Nina*~* (NOT Nin)

      Listening to: people talking Current thoughts: CHRIS SMELLS! Mood: bored New MY Word(s): shi-cad-it  BOO everyone, yes Jordan, it sucks being grounded.  LoL, well anyways I've gotten hooked on Jaws.  It's stuck in my head 24/7.  I have dreams about it, dreams that I'm shooting Jaws underwater in my sleep.  It's an addicting NES game.     Good things about Jaws  1. It's fun 2. You can flick off the tv and cuss it out and you don't get in trouble (because your mom does the same thing) 3. Good 'bonding' time with mom.   Bad things about Jaws  1. You start having dreams about it. 2. It's addicting   Annoying things about Jaws   1. Your mom tries to 'teach' you how to play and really all she wants to do is PLAY! 2. You bump into 7 baby jaws without a big jaws, you get like 6 doubles of baby jaws, and NO bonus scene. 3. You bump into 3 or more baby jaws WHILE fighting big jaws. 4. You die when you have a scuba gear and you have jaws down by 7 power lines.  I have too much free time on my hands now that I have no phone, and no computer.    I am now OBLIGED to go to Favorites because my mom bought me a $100 dress.  She only bought it because I am difficult to shop for in dresses because I hate all dresses.  This was ok, for a PINK dress... But I want a date. and the one person I want to go with probably wouldn't even ask me to go.  This sucks.  I have to go dateless or not...HELP ME!  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: keyboards Current thoughts: School's boring, but fun with friends Mood: upbeat New MY Word(s): addiction-in-ing (toma do it phoenetically)  School school school, finally I can update.  I am so happy.  I found a cooliest store.  GAMESTOP!  They sell the old NES games, it's so great!  I got Tetris, and some weird stupid game that was...3 bucks.  But oh well.  I was playing almost all weekend.  It's the next bestest thing to internet.  I'm grounded for a long long long long LOOONNNGGGG time, phone and all.  I love playing Jaws.  BOOYEA though I haven't beaten him yet.... Anticipation is fun, guessing pictures and all. I want to get the other Zelda game that I don't have, it has some sword on it.  I'd say that the OLD Zelda games are better than the new ones, not picture-wise and all, but seeing as it was the original and all.  But then again, if I said it was better, I'd be getting some ass-whooping from some gamers *cough* Robert *cough*.  Well I'm gonna go, laterZ people and keep writing!  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: Lower Class Brats - Rather be hated Current thoughts: fun fun, really? Mood: happy New MY Word(s): Whore Moments (inside joke!)  Today was funny.    Nicole and me went to the ROTC compound, and Joel had taken his shirt off.  Talk about a yummy bod.    Nicole:  GOSH I just would love to hold his body.  Talk about a yummy body.  His wife is going to be REALLYYY happy.  I can't help my hormones.  WELL I thought she said "I can't help my whore moments."  Nina:  Did you just say "I can't help my whore moments?" Nicole:  HAHA NO, but they're like the same thing don't you think?  OK instead of saying hormones, from now on it'll be 'Whore Moments'."  He has like the best muscles.  I love pinching his sides, because he doesn't know if it hurts or if it tickles.  So I'll keep doing it until he grabs my hands to stop.    Spenser, AHH, I love hugging him.  Hehe, lol yea.  He's so huggable.  And he has my picture in his wallet on TOP of everything else, I feel so special :).  Hehe.  bye for now peoples!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: School's over, I'm home! Mood: happy  Haha I can't say "Ice Rays"  first time I said it I said "Ice Raids"  the second time I said "Ice Age".  Such crazyness.  I had fun at school, for once, well...I always have fun with my friends.  Adam fell on top of me!  I did it on purpose, because he put his arms around my neck so I fell over and he fell on top of me and I fell on the floor.  When we're with Adam it's fun time all the time it seems.  Well I'll type in later when I can think of what else happened today.

      Listening to: Malcom in the Middle Current thoughts: I feel like the world is spinning Mood: dizzy  I had fun at the mall, I played at the arcade.  I dragged Robert into Limited Too, good thing he's confident with his sexuality.  Then I dragged him to all the stores that had belly button rings.  After that, we went to the movies.  We saw Lord of the Rings, it was kewl, I actually understood this one, I only saw the first one, and I didn't understand ONE single freaking thing about it.  But gosh, before the movie ended, I got 'Knock-me-over' cramps.  I swear, I wanted to cry.  But I didn't want to worry Robert so I just held it in.  And now that I've taken medicine that makes me drowsy, and not even having any sleep whatsoever last night because of the all-nighter on the phone, it makes you feel dizzy and you have to just sit and not walk.  I feel so bad.  I'm so happy because I got Legacy of Blood!  I'm gonna start reading it before I go to bed.  Well I'm gonna go because I'm tired of looking at the screen, or I'm going to fall out of the chair unconcious.

      Listening to: 7th Heaven Current thoughts: I'm bored Mood: amused  You know, it's funny when you're pulling an all nighter, and you're past the point of insanity.  You start saying things you don't know what you're saying.  I was talking on the phone, and I was half asleep, or half dazed.  We were talking about something, I don't exactly recall but I remember shocking myself when I said "Well you better lock those boobs up"  Now that freaked me out.

      Listening to: Greenday - Poprocks and Coke Current thoughts: HSN sellers try too hard to tell their products Mood: annoyed...and just glad cuz I got enough sleep for once this WEEK Notes (sorry toma, i like ur idea): No. 5- Advice to you people who sell products on tv, don't praise the product you're selling so much.  We all know that you used the product, and you didn't like it.  You had to use it against your will.  You're thinking "Damn if I have to put another durned face cleaner/scrub/mask on my face I'll quit this job", when you know you love the tv watchers watching you talk talk talk.  And it gets to a point that if you keep on praising that product, nobody wants to believe it.  That pretty much explains my day so far, I woke up at 1:30 in the afternoon.  Finally getting more than 10 hours of much needed sleep, seeing as I made an all-nighter on Thursday night leading to Friday.  I lost myself in a game of Tetris for at least 30 minutes.    I was then watching HSN, my mom likes watching it, and I can't get mad at her for it.  I got a camera off there, it's not all that great, but a small camera at least gets me attention.  They were doing some Insta-Tox face cleaner, serum, creams, ETC. and they were just praising and saying how good it is.  But one thing they forgot to say.  It's TEMPORARY!  I should know, mom got that stuff.  She likes it, but it's temporary, and I think it's a waste of money buying that kit for 70 bucks!  I'd just go to the store, and buy my favorite mint mask that works great on my face for under 5 bucks.  Come on people, get a life!  You gonna believe some people, pretty sometimes, just to get a product that supposedly works when they're only doing they're job and saying good things about it just to sell it??    OK know what?  I'm just tired of it today, I'll post later when I'm in a better mood I guess...LaterZ

      Listening to: Everyone Else - Cereal Current thoughts: runny nose sucks buttmonkey Mood: ditto  I feel so 'loved'.  LOTS of people, well many, wanted my picture!  Spencer wanted it and I gave him one, Laura, April wanted both, Kelly, Nicole still hasn't gotten hers, Joel got it, Cassandra, and I forgot who else.  GOSH Nicole has got a bad bad BAD mind.  Hehe.  Because I was wondering why Joel would want my picture.  Nicole goes "I know I know, *devilish grin*"  so I told her "You better not be thinking what I'm thinking, are you thinking what I'm thinking?"  Nicole - "I think so, probably, maybe even worse though."  So during lunch she decides to tell Kelly "Kelly why do you think Joel would want Nina's picture?  You know that song with the words 'All I Need Is Your Picture?' "  Kelly - "Yeah, why?"  Nicole - "Because I think that's why Joel wants it.  To YOU know you know *laughs* "  Kelly laughed too.  I got it and stomped off going "EW EW EW EW!  You're WRONG!  You're just sick, yucky!"  Hehe, then I went and sat down, w/ Adam, Kelly, girl I don't know, and Nicole and I stole food!  yup :)

      Listening to: Gavin Degraw - Chemical Party Current thoughts: I hate allergies Mood: stuffy New MY Word(s): buttnut, anonymouse, insympathetic, undressed out  Today during gym we were bored as usual, and Dustin saw my shirt "Boyfriends make nice pets", along w/ some other guy who I'm still not sure what his name is.  Here it is:  Boy- See, no, boys can't be the pet.  It's the girl who's supposed to be the pet.  She's gotta take care of the guy, she's gotta cook his food, do his laundry-- Me- Man I'd be like "B*tch make your own dinner!" Monica- HAHA good one Nina, good job.  *laughs* Boy- If a girl told me tha I'd be getting a divorce from her. Me- Then I'd just say "B*tch you sleep on the couch" Boy- No because I would just kick your @ss out the house, I bought it, you don't own it!  Boy wasn't that a nice conversation?  hehe

      Listening to: Ashlee Simpson - Just Let Me Cry Current thoughts: These flip-top calculators help me relax, and popping the bubble wrap crap does too.  Why do I want things I can't have? Mood: sad/happy/relaxed I don't know, if you know what kind of mood that is, why don't you inform me on it!?  Alex & Emma was the most confusing movie there is.  What was the point?  I mean, it was a good movie all in all, but the fact that it was about a guy telling his life story for a book, w/ characters based in real life, only to save his own @ss from getting killed by a group of guys he couldn't pay back for gambling, was kind of stupid.  I mean, for crying out loud, he falls in love w/ the stenographer!?  How ironic is that?  I mean, he's supposed to be professional about this whole telling the story to her, and near the end he almost screws it up by getting interested in her.  Of course, hate to spoil the ending, but he does get the money to the Cuban Mafia and he does end up getting BACK w/ Emma (the stenographer) only after she finds out there was a 'Polina' and dumps him for lying.  Why do love stories work out in the end in movies?  That's not how it freakin' happens in real life.  It makes you wish, that you'll fall in love w/ the love of your life after only meeting them once and then you'll be happily ever after in love w/ that person living the fairy-tale life.  What a bunch of bull-cr@p.

      Listening to: Blue October - Razorblade Current thoughts: Water....MmMmM Mood: tired Notes (sorry toma, i like ur idea): No. 4 - Don't wear shirts w/ sayings that insult, teachers remember, and they think you're mean.  Example: "Don't speak unless spoken to."  My World History teacher thinks I'm mean, and that I have lots of boyfriends since I walk w/ lots of guy friends.  Today, in World History Class-  Teacher- I need to talk to you after class just like the other guy. Girl- Ahhh... Teacher- Why are you saying 'Ahh' when you don't even know what I might say to you.  I could be giving you candy.  *opens desk drawer, takes out a candy* See I could be giving you candy.  *grabs candy, throws it in desk, and closes the drawer*  But it's MY candy you can't have it, stay away from my desk!  Same teacher, different student-  Girl- Can I go to the restroom? Teacher- Sure, what class are you in? Girl- This class. Teacher- Well of course I know you're in this class, why wouldn't you be if you were in here.  I mean what grade are you in, senior, junior, sophmore? Girl- Junior Teacher- Okay that's what I wanted to know, you can go.  *girl leaves*  Gosh what a smart girl, well of course she's in this class.  I could just smack her upside the head.  If I had wanted to know that she was in my class I'd ask her what class she had for this period.  It's fun having a teacher who insults students.  Then of course he thinks I'm the meanest girl in his class, for pinching Dustin and hitting him.  Plus the shirts I wear "Smile, it confuses people"  "I'm just one big f#&@$ing ray of sunshine aren't I?"  And many other shirts, plus I got some new ones for Christmas.  OH JOY!

Mood: happy Notes (sorry toma, i like ur idea): No. 3 - Don't go outside in 50 degree weather w/ a spaghetti strap shirt.  I was listening to the radio and the guy was saying "There was this guy that had a tattoo on his leg that said 'I Love Women'.  This guy had to get a bipass and when he did, they had to cut out a vein out of the leg that had I Love Women on it.  So when they sewed it back up they cut off 'wo' on it so now the tattoo says 'I love men'.  Let's just hope he has to get some ot her kind of surgery and they can take off the 'n' on it or something so it would say 'I Love Me' because that is really embarassing."  This I found amusing.

Well...not really cuz it's the only game that I can stand and stay SANE w/.  I played Super Mario Bros. for hours last week before New Years..beat like 7 worlds in 1 day, I can't even do that on the regular nintendo, my hand got cramped up from playing so much.  Tetris Worlds is annoying...I've lost it playing that game.  REALLY lost it.  I had dreams about little blocks dropping, and sticking, and fusion-ing and stuff.  I can't even get hooked to Diablo 2 like I used to...something's up.

Yesterday me and a few family members went to a restaurant, I was craving spaghetti.  Earlier that day we had gone to a memorial service, and there was what seemed a 20-30 year old picture of my aunt.  My mom and grandmother and my uncle were saying some stuff about her and everything, and I chimed in "Well yeah that was a picture whenever she didn't seem to have a double chin"  and everyone bursted out laughing their heads off, I nearly cried.  I couldn't help it, the picture they had of her didn't even look like my aunt, it was tempting, and slipped out of my mouth.

NO I wasn't, I was singing you couldn't hear me, and I was....broken when it came to the hand movements because I didn't know I was messing with my hands until you were saying something.  I didn't want to talk while I was singing.    Frank got my letter, I'm only hoping Keesha and Joseph get them by today.  I know Keesha will write me back, but I will fly a plane and kick Joseph's butt if he doesn't write me back.  Well....not really but anyways yeah, my expression.    My uncle JD pierced his nose.  His NOSE for crying out loud, and he's a guy!  I think he's swinging a little toward the 'other' side if you know what I mean.    Mark you're mean!  LoL.  Telling Jose what happened on Valentine's Day.  I'm still embarassed about that.  And now I know Jose and Carlos will never let it go, they'll keep on making fun of me.  I guess I'll just laugh along, it was kinda funny, in a weird distorted kind of way.    Bye bye! *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: People Current thoughts: My hands are red....was I caught red handed? Mood: happy and bored  I decided to join a little game of....Egyptian Rat Screw.  Megan, Adam, and 2 other girls, and Manuel were playing.  Manuel was being a SORE loser and was all mad when I joined in when I found a double and slapped on it.  I quit, cuz he was getting me mad, and then I joined again.  He was also kicking me!  He's a meanie.  LoL I should use my 'pseudo soccer kick' and kick him hard.  Nah I can't kick.    I just ate a donut!  LoL it was goooooodddd, it was big, and thick, and bready.  I had an orange before that but it didn't taste all that sweet.  I love SWEET oranges.  This was a little....plain.  I want another lemon like the one I had the other day, it was delicious.  But NO I couldn't take anymore home because my godmother wouldn't let me because what was left on the tree was what was left all together, they only grow in December.    I'm getting corrected on my grammar by somebody *cough* Megan *cough* hehe.  I'm gonna go now because.....I don't know what else to say.  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: It huurrrrttttssssss! Mood: content and hurt   urlLink New Patch   urlLink There is a trojan on your computer   urlLink Don't eat that banana   I made a complete and total fool of myself yesterday!  I was on the stage in speech class and I underestimated my distance because I thought I had at least another footstep to get off, so I backed off and my hand missed the edge of the stage.  I fell backwards and fell right into the desk behind me.  I had to get picked up by this one guy Alex.  I felt so embarassed I was covering my face laughing.  I have a big bruise right where I hit, and I can't press down on my arm hard.  I hate Robert.  GAG I just found out, I can't put G. as his last initial because my FRIEND Robert has a G. as his last initial too!  OK well anyways, Robert at schoooll, I hate him.  He's talking a bunch of smack.  And I'm not going into details about it.  About my FRIEND Robert, who works at Whataburger, is the koolest person I know.  I wish there were more guys like him.  Sweet, funny, nice, cool, etc.  I just wish he would get unshy and learn to talk to girls.  He thinks he's ugly, and he's not.  Thinks he can't get a decent girlfriend, he needs to at least try to talk to girls!  When I get to talk to him he makes my day, he's easy to talk to and just....understanding.  I can tell him ALMOST anything.  I hope he reads this.  And if he does, ROBERT I need to get out of the house, take me somewhere!    HAHA Chris (not you CSE) but my other friend Chris, had this funny chipmunk song singing "I'm too sexy for my shirt".    Welllll I shall go, my arm hurts, thought that's not what's keeping me from typing.  It's the little amount of time left that I have with my friends that's making me go.  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: Chris talk and type Current thoughts: Chris is a dork Mood: happy   urlLink Why Can't I Sit in the Chair??   Haha, yesterday Megan was hitting me because I never told her I was with Mark.  She makes a good actor actually.  She's convincing when she sounds like she's crying.  I can make myself cry, but can't sound like it.    So I'm hoping that Frank got my letter yesterday, or hopefully today.  And maybe in the next two days Joseph and Keesha will get mine.  Keesha got the picture that Chris drew of a Ozzy Osbourne clown.    Man that test sucks monkey butt.  Just when I'm confortable doing my essay, they call us in from the portables because there's like a thunderstorm warning and whatnot.  Like...30 minutes later it's over with and there was no more!!  That really ticked me off.  I finished the test like at...1?  I started at 9:20!  That was a freaking long test man.  Well I better go because Chris is being a big fat dork.  He won't leave me alone telling me to "Type type type type type"  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: What did the blonde mother think when the school called telling her that her daughter missed 1 or more periods that day in school? Mood: bored and content  You know it's really messed up and weird when you look in the mirror with your natural hair color and thinking "Who the hell is that looking at me in the mirror??  It's freakin-definetely not me!"  Yeah...I dyed my hair last night, again, but a darker color, mom insisted on it.  It made my eyes look lighter, and my hair's darker, and I look weird like....weird I guess.  So today's the TAKS test (search it up if you don't know about it, gay Bush made them make it to challenge us more, saying that the TAAS didn't challenge us enough, wasn't HARD enough).  I hate having to write essays and open-ended questions.  Mark you're lucky, all you have to do is the open-ended questions and not the essay.  Chris....I know nothing about what you have to do.  And the worst part of it is you can't study for a state test, not really.  You just have to rely on what you learned over the years, or at least the year now that they messed with it.  We had to reteach ourselves how to write an essay because the way they'd been teaching us through middle school and 9th grade was 'wrong'.  "For example" and "In addition" "In conclusion" cannot be used in it or points will be taken or it'll be counted against us.  It sucks....but sooner I get it over with the better.  K well....I shall leave because I'm gonna go meet my friends in the band hall, LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: The Union Underground - South Texas Death Ride Current thoughts: Classs......is.....boring Mood: Bored Comic(s):  urlLink The Moon is Yelling at me ,  urlLink I have love for you ,  urlLink I'm listening to sad songs    Nobody likes my shirt.  Well my friends do, but my other friends don't.  Stephen and Carlos for example, they think I'm sexist.    Guy: Hi Girl: If you have something to say SHUT UP!  See??  What's their problem?  So I went out of town this weekend.  I got like...lots of clothes.  Cool pants, shirts, and stuff.  I saw my mom's friend, and we went to her mom's house.  They have a miniature horse, and my godmother had said it was a girl.  WELL when I was trying to take pictures of "Her" 'she' was eating grass, I see something that says "That horse is NOT a girl!".  I was like....I didn't need to see that!  I also got to talk to Joseph.  Mom let me use her cell phone to call him.  He's like the 4th person to call me a tease.  First Spenser, then Robert, then Nicole and Kelly and now Joseph.  He was referring to the many times he's seen me on the webcam with a spaghetti strap shirt (or undershirt).  I wrote 3 letters, one to my friend Frank, one to Joseph, and one to Keesha.  I've been in a writing letter mood. I had this super-cool lemon.  It was like an orange, it looked like one.  But it didn't taste like one.  It was sour, and good, and I took one home.  I still need to eat it.  Last time I ate one, I got sick.    My cousin Aaron is a little demon child.  He abused me, he hit my head.  I was hugging him and picked him up to go to the couch.  He sat down for a bit, then left.  I picked him up later and then he started hitting me.  Didn't hurt, but still I have feelings too!  Today, I'm wearing green.  For the first time it seems.  Green pants, green sleeved shirts, and....green wristband.  The purse is khaki though.    Alright, laterZ people!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: I want to cry Mood: happy  DUDE this stuff is sour.  I teared on the way to the library.  That's crazyness, I'm never affected that much by sour stuff.  Well anyways, I'm listening to the radio this morning and I hear this thing called  urlLink My Pet Fat  and I'm wondering "Does this stuff REALLY work?".  I mean come on, what if you go to a restaurant, and happen to forget your pet fat.  How can you 'pet' your pet fat then??  I will keep reading up on it.  Man, my luck's been running then this week.  Tuesday, while I was at my friend Kelly's grandmother's house, her grandmother's dog Scooby tried to hump me...and actually succeeded to do that on my jacket...YUCK.  And then that night, my mom goes "Look, there's the ho-cat" and when I turn around she's rolling on the ground, I look again and the boy cat is on top of her!  He was there for quite some time.  So my mom says "Looks like our cat isn't a virgin anymore".  I was scarred for life I might say.  I think I've gone crazy.  Last night, I was dancing in the bathroom to "If you like Pina Coladas" while the cat was in there, and she was staring up at me like "Who the hell are you and what the hell have you done with my owner".  Or she was just looking at me like I was crazy.  I had a bad headache and so I had fallen asleep because I couldn't find the medicine, then after I woke up I found it and took some.  I felt a lot better, jumping up for joy kind of better, but instead I had seen The Sweetest Thing, and started dancing to the song that they were dancing to.  If Nicole had seen me she would've been like "Nina!".      K...well anyways, I need to think of some funny stuff because I have suddenly become boring, or maybe I've always been boring just thought myself interesting, LaterZ!

      Current thoughts: 'Hurry up and leave me alone already' (I said that to my sister the other day, I kinda like the way it sounds) Mood: bored  So yesterday in class (speech) some of the students got to use the nailgun.  I was one of them.  It was soooo kool, except for when Michael told the teacher not to let me use it because it would push me back since I'm small.  I did it like...5 times?  This boy James, who's dangerous about that stuff, and is always, seems always, thinking about porn, that's all that's ever on his mind.  He was trying to figure out if he could shoot the nailgun without having to put it up against something, and then he figured it out.  Me and this girl Megan were wondering what the gun could shoot through, thinking if it could shoot through maybe...concrete, or the door.  James aimed for the school door and shot.  We heard it hit the door but no indention to where it hit.  He went and looked for the nail and he found it on the floor, all bent and messed up.  The theater arts teacher saw James shoot the gun and started yelling at our teacher saying "You have some immature students playing with your tools Mr. Bryan, you need to get after them or watch them more".  The teacher didn't even care, he acted like it when the theater arts teacher was there, but when he left he laughed about it, but told James not to do it again saying "I don't want any students going to the nurse with nails in their leg or something."  So..in P.E. we haven't had MANY interesting conversations that stuck out but here were two things that I thought were funny that Dustin had said:  Dustin- I wanna fuck a dog. Me- That was random Dustin- Yeah I know, I wanted to break the silence.  Dustin- You know what? Me- Huh? Dustin- They have a gay mafia. Me- Oh really.. Dustin- Yeah, it's called the mauve hand. Me- And?? Dustin- They ask each other "Does this gun make me look fat?" since they stuff the guns in the back of their pants.  My cat is an expensive cat, she likes to eat selenium, some pills that my dad used to take for....I don't know, maybe I should search it up.  But I remember my old cat Salem liked this stomach medicine called Panokase, and everytime we did my dad's medicine he would go right for the bottle and try to eat it.    K, well anyways, LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: Why did the man throw the clock out the window? (it's not what you think) Mood: mad  This computer is sooooo SLOW!  Well anyways, I hope mom likes her little 'surprise' *angel face*.  She got me mad yesterday, and when I was washing dishes there was this baby lizard on the door.  I picked it up and put it in the house, there's enough bugs in the house for the lizard to live on until it gets a little bigger.  I just hope my mom and sister notice it.    I just found out that my house is haunted, or at least my mom and sister think so.  They see this black thing that walks across in the hall and supposedly someone before my dad moved into the house commited suicide.  Maybe that would explain the sudden breezes while I'm in the kitchen, or maybe I've been imagining it all along and my mom's just trying to scare me.    K so now I feel all weird, and I'm going to go because....I feel weird.  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: My hair looks yucky Mood: happy  Wednesday night I had the best tasting oxy-moron there could ever be, jumbo shrimp doesn't even compare.  Fried ice cream!  It tastes so good.  It still makes me wonder HOW they do it!?  Well the only thing I know about it is that it's covered in corn flakes (Frosted Flakes I think) and is fried, but how does it NOT melt??  Do they put it in the freezer right afterwards?  They top it off with whipped cream and fudge and it's served inside a crunched taco or whatever, shaped like a bowl.  Oh, and last night, I know this sounds weird but I had...popcorn and mustard.  You may think I'm weird, go ahead, but I'm telling you it's the greatest.  The only thing missing last night though was the pickles, we didn't have any *tear*.  I finally got that craving out of my system.    Well anyways, it's Friday, and usually I don't like Fridays, but today is the exception.  Only except for the fact that I half-a$$ed my hair today, meaning that I ironed the bottom but not the top.  So the top looks all frizzy and whatnot.  It kinda looks like my favorite AMC character, but let's face it, I'll never be able to do my hair like that.    K, well LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: What the hell is a love swing??  Let alone a love sling?? Mood: happy  OK, so I'm listening to this radio station this morning, and people were saying what they wanted for Valentine's Day.  Some girl was saying that she wanted her husband to get her a love swing, it hangs from the ceiling.  I'm curious as to...what is the purpose??  She was also talking about the love sling, where this sling goes around the neck, and the string goes all the way to the ankle and the guy carries the girl.  Where the heck to people come up with this stuff???!!!  My friends are currently trying to get me mad, they're staring at me, and messing with the computer WHILE I'm trying to do this post, he just umplugged the stupid keyboard just now!    I'm hoping my friend gets my letter today so she writes me back.  It sucks that she lives all the way in Kentucky and I can only communicate to her by 'Snail Mail'.  I have so much to tell her now.  I'm getting so mad at this current moment because everything's going on.  Laura's on the verge of not talking to me because I won't give Alfredo a chance...and Nicole won't quit bugging Spenser to tell me that he likes me.    Now they're mentioning about my whole 'letter' incident last year with James and Kirby.  It's not my fault James called me a bitch and Kirby slapped my butt.  I only killed 2 birds with one stone.    THAT'S IT.  I'm killing this post, I can't think with them talking about me, looking at me.  GRR!!  LaterZ  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: silence Current thoughts: DUDE....I need money! Mood: happy  I don't know what it is that makes old people snap.  Maybe it's the absence of children, the youth.  Bill, next door neighbor that died, surely didn't snap, it's probably because he had me and my mom over there for what seems everyday.  There's this married couple a few blocks from me and I know that they don't have any children living with them, all their children are grown up and have children of their own.  But this couple, I think it's the wife, they have two white (fake might I add) ducks in their backyard and you can see them since they have a hurricane fence, but these ducks scare me.  It seems they're always dressed.  They'll have something like...a raincoat, or something like that.  Sometimes it seems like they are...boys, and sometimes girls.  It's SCARY!  They're dressed up in dresses right now, in red and white, since it's Valentine's coming up of course.  So..if they have no clothes on, does this mean they're naked??  I've been pondering on that for quite some time now.  OK, so I'm not sick, maybe I was yesterday just the tiniest bit, but I ate and didn't throw up so that must be a good thing??    I really need money.  I came up with this idea last night.  I'm grounded from the phone and internet right??  The most two efficient ways to communicating with someone.  Well I thought last night, since I'm grounded from those two things, why can't I get walkie talkies? (or whatever they call those things these days, 2 way radios?)  She didn't say that!  I can't get in trouble for using those.  The only problem is...I need money, or ask my uncle if he still has his from a few years ago.  Me and Mark don't live more than two miles from each other, they'd work perfect.  Just tell each other what time to turn on the walkie talkies and then TA-DA, it's done, phone made easy (or something like that).    Okies, well I'm done with my whole....what is this again??  Well anyways, yeah, I actually am happy, I think I rely too much on sugar products to make me upbeat because this morning I had a cinnamon twist and now I'm HAPPY!  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      K, I'm back from my pause of posts.  Friday I didn't feel like posting.  Favorites was cool, except for the fact that my friend danced like.....NO COMMENT.  Saturday was veering for me NOT to go to Favorites, everything went wrong.  Friday we had bought some pins for my neighbor to do my hair with, and then, we lost them.  Don't know how, seemed to vanish, but I bet we find them this week and go "Damn it where were these when I needed them".  We spent like another 5 bucks on hair stuff.  So we get my nails done, all good there, we go to WalMart and the next thing that happens, my nail chips right on the truck door.  We get home, and decide it's rest time until like 5, but then the neighbor calls us and says that if I wanted to risk getting sick, that she would do my hair because everyone at that house was sick with the stomach virus.  SO, that was my Saturday, and I don't feel good, think I got the stomach virus after all.  This will be, yet again, another sucky post because I don't know what to talk about.  LaterZ!

      Current thoughts: I rule, not really, but just thought I'd say that Mood: forcing to be happy New MY Word(s): muches  K, I owe it to all my friends to at least do a happy post today.  And here's something that happened this morning:  Me: Mom are you going to use the Ex-Boyfriend today??  I think I should've been more specific because she thought I asked if she was going to use HER ex-boyfriend today when I was really asking if she was going to use the new Ex-Boyfriend shirt, which yes, it's added to my 'boy collection' of shirts.  Steven asked me why I have shirts about boys and they sound like I hate them.  I only have 3 shirts now about boys.  "Boyfriends make nice pets" "Boys are Smelly" and now the best one "Ex-Boyfriend" where it has a picture of a boy and girl and the boy's face is all markered out.  Maybe Michael will get the idea now, hehehe.  I also got a kool watch yesterday, it has Boys Are Smelly on it.  I thought I almost ruined it yesterday because I accidently wore it to take a bath and I don't think it's waterproof.    So one person's noticed my nails so far.  Yesterday I went with my mom to go get her nails done (with as rough as I am with my nails I'm not doing them until Saturday).  I was bored and decided to try out all different colors on my nails, and I didn't take off 3 of the nails on my left hand and one on my right thumbnail.  And this boy noticed and goes "You know your nails are different colors".  At least I'm getting noticed for something.  I was thinking yesterday, and an old crush of mine just popped into my head, I had met him like...before 5th grade and at that VBS thing they do every summer.  The reason he popped into my head is because I remember when we were playing kickball his best friend was playing the base person and I was going to run past him and he kicked me trying to stop me, and kicked me RIGHT on my shin, I remember I like blacked out for a second because I don't remember seeing anything when he kicked me.  Easy way to get your crush to notice you though, hurt yourself right in front of them and they sit next to you the rest of the day.  Hehe.  Alright, I can't think of anything more happy, if I have anything more happy it just won't pop into my head at this moment.  And if I do get anything in my head I'll write it down and put it in tomorrow seeing as how my short term memory isn't very good.  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: life sucks Mood: ...don't ask  Know what I learned in World History yesterday??  That the queen is a girl!  Sorry just trying to find some humor, that wasn't it I guess.  I had to do an impromptu in speech class yesterday, and it was sooooo nervewracking (if that's not a word then it's mine!)!  I did it on duct tape, and even though I had all the words in my head, I couldn't say it, I can never find the words to say anything and that sucks butt!  Man, so my assumptions were correct, he does like me still and it's p---ing me off I swear.  It's not for the fact that he likes me, because I could care less, but it's the fact about the way he's going about it.  He's trying to get Josh to ask me why I don't like him when Michael knows all too well why, or maybe he doesn't, and I could give a flying freak if he ever finds out.  The only thing I'll say about his sorry ass is that he blew his chance a LOONNGGG time ago and it's never EVER going to happen again, I learned my mistake the second time.  I've been thinking about what to do on Sunday, and I know it's like way too early to tell what I'm going to do, but I really want to go to my mom's boyfriend's mother's house to maybe try and visit my friend Armando.  It's been ages since I've talked to him and usually I can tell him everything, even if he tries to lighten it up WAY tooo much.  Buuuuttttt I don't know what's going to happen, and I know mom will just go "HELL no" so what's the use in even trying??  And my friends...SOME, are getting me mad, and need to back the freak off a bit,, it's getting annoying, but I'm not mentioning names here.    K well, I know this sounds like I'm pissed off, so I'll just get off before I start ranting on and on and on.  LaterZ  *~*Nina*~*

      How did I know this was going to happen???  That my ex-boyfriend would start calling around this time of the year?  Is it because it's been almost a year since we broke up and he's still hung up on me??  OR has he not found a date to Favorites and is hoping that I'll be free.  I remember our conversation in the first semester of school and there was a glimmer of hope in his voice when he asked me if I was thinking about going to Favorites, but dude, that was like in November?  HOW am I to make a decision that early?  Maybe I just knew he was going to start calling because he's predictable like when you know what's going to happen to the glue inside of an open bottle and you forget to close it (I'm sorry if that didn't make sense, it made sense last night when I thought about it).  I can't find words to talk right now, maybe it's because I feel rushed seeing as how it's 8:40 and my friends are waiting for me in the band hall, I know this has probably got to be the most SUCKIEST post I've ever done, or if you've read my archives, those probably suck more.  I'm gonna go, BYE!  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

I got a date to Favorites, not Spenser, but it's all good.  At least I don't have to go by myself :D.  MANNN Long weekend, well it actually passed by fast.  I got sick, still sick, and it sucks.  Let's seee....Saturday, my sister had a party.  It was fun actually, considering that I kicked Mark's butt in the moonjump hehe.  It's funny because me and Mark spent more time on the moonjump than all the little kids did, I think they got bored on it, all they thought about doing was JUMPING.  We fought.  Of course it all mostly ended when I ACCIDENTLY, I said ACCIDENTLY MARK!, kicked him someewhheerreee (Chris knows it as No-No).  It's not my fault that moonjumps alter your movement ability because of the air in the thing.  I got pictures of you Mark!  Let's see you try and delete them now.  Here were a few conversations Friday (at school) that I thought were funny-  Nicole: Lots of guys like you. Me: Nobody likes me, I swear! Layla: *puts hand on leg* But I like you. Me: *screams*  Nicole: lets act like civil people Me: But we can't act like civil people, this isn't the civil war. Nicole: Can't we all act like civilized people?!  World History Teacher: Who's picture is this? *looks for name, finds it* Oh okay, I found it, I better not say who's it is, I'm afraid she'll come up here and kick my butt. (and of course we all know who that person is)  The same teacher was talking about beating Moody (who's team happens to be the Trojans) for the basketball team and some boy decided to be smart so Raymond snitched him out: Raymond: Sir, Jimmy said "You gotta be stiff when you go against the Trojans.  OK, well I'm gonna go because Nicole and Kelly just came to bug me to get out of the library, so I'll write back tomorrow!  LaterZ  *~*Nina*~*

      I feel all happy happy.  You know why?  Because I did my hair!  Oh yeah...I know I sound like one of those girls who dye their hair like every month.  I'm not LIKE that, it just so happens the last few months I haven't been so satisified with my hair.  I did red highlights, and the compliments I'm getting make me feel SO great.  My mom didn't like the idea of doing my hair, she was all for doing the color and all, but she didn't want to DO it herself.  She wanted it professionally done but if I did that then it would be like over a hundred bucks the first time and about 60 bucks for touchups.  Better to just get the stuff you can get at the grocery story for 10 bucks and get it over with.  I didn't think I was going to like the results, but actually, I DO!  Of course if my hair is down nobody can see it, but when it's pulled back people can see it.  I love my hair, but not in that overly-obsessive way.  And if I get in trouble I'll get mad because think about it, there are girls here who have green in their hair, and do they get in trouble??  I think not.  But then I saw a girl with the same highlights as me, except more noticeable and she had to REDYE her hair so it was brown.  And then there's this other girl who has the same highlights and she has yet to get in trouble.  There's something really wrong with this school's system of discipline.  They think "Oh that hair's going to be distracting, better take that person in."  When think about it, it's only going to be distracting for a day.  And if the attention lasts for over a day it's only for the people who didn't see it the first time around.  Example, I did my hair a new way last week and Nicole noticed, I did it again this week and she didn't make that much of a big deal on it.  So therefore, attention won't be spent on the hairstyle.  Who's going to be STARING at the hair, what, they want to fail?  Nah I think these teachers and school officials just want drones of themselves.  Disciplined (not), responsible (rarely probably), and quiet (when they yell at the students is that quiet??).

      You know the cold has gone to your head when you mix words up.   ME: I not feel very good. Yeahh... That's what I said to Nicole this morning.  So I went to go see Dawn of the Dead this weekend, while getting a NEW pair of pants a different color than the ones I already had because the OTHER pair was the same pair as Monica.  If I get a different color she won't think I'm copying her.  Dawn of the Dead was one of the weirdest movies.  Well not weirdest, but very weird.  It has a cool soundtrack only because one of the songs on it I liked because it was like that one song by Disturbed called Down with the Sickness.  Either Disturbed copied someone, or someone copied Disturbed to go along with the movie.  I shall ponder on this.  Having to take my little 8 year old cousin everywhere too wasn't very fun.  First of all my sister got along with him.  They both worked on my nerves.  Then my mom's friend came to Bay City also with HIS 8 year old son.  Remember what I said about a week ago about 8 year olds being the scum of the earth??  I'm still thinking that.  I don't remember what age I met Toma at, but he was very mature for his age, wait a minute, he's only a year younger than me.  But then again he's 2 years younger than me in grade levels.    Yeah...so I'm getting glasses again.  I don't mind, I really wanted the last pair I had, but I lost them.  Mom wasn't very happy about that.  But now I'm probably going to be made fun of again by David and.....well other people, I don't remember who but other people.  Brandon, if we were still talking, would probably say I was sexy.  He's a dork, of course he is, he's the ORIGINAL person who put the dork in dork.  Well in my book he's the only true dork.

      Nina: My lipgloss tastes so good it tastes like boogers.  NOW that was a major slipup, one that Mark wouldn't let me go on yesterday.  I meant to say 'big red' and Nicole STILL wonders where I got the boogers from.  Of course that slipup wasn't as bad as me telling Mark "I'm not a girl".  My slipups lately have been becoming weirder and weirder.  Nina: Oh look it's person Nicole: Who's that? Nina: There's Tom and there's Andy. (I couldn't remember the names that I actually said but I know I pointed at Michael and some other boy, bear with me, I forgot my notebook I wrote names down in) Nicole: And who am I? Nina: Uhh....weirdo?  That wasn't all funny...but I found I should put something in this thing. So I let my emotions get to me yesterday, and I don't know why I let such a thing happen.  I guess I was tired of this one girl who keeps on looking at me like I'm some stupid sophmore.  Ever since I started sitting with Spenser and Robert at their table this girl keeps on looking at me...I don't know how to explain the looks, just not nice looks.  And yesterday it just so happened that Nicole's friends (and some mine) decided to ALL sit with us.  Well that girl came to sit down at the table next to us and saw everyone and looked at me like it was all my fault.  I got so mad I was like "You know what, fuck this I'm leaving this is just getting out of hand" (of course not in front of the girl because she had left to go get her BOYFRIEND his lunch).  I went outside, still all mad trying to find another friend to sit with and found my friend Adam.  But then I was still mad throughout the rest of the day and when I got to P.E. Monica asked me what was wrong, so I told her but got all emotional.  I hate when that happens when I'm SO mad I just get...yeah you get the point.  Well I should've just taken Chris's advice, he told me just to ignore her.  I told Robert about it last night and he told me to just ignore it too...not to show my emotions because if I do she'll think she was winning.  MAN I hate when my friends are right. :@ (msn face for mad)>:o (and I don't know about that face, but it looks cool, I think it's AIM).  OH and when we were outside, Kirby decides to show me pictures (I didn't want to see) of his niece and stuff, and he stood in front of Alex.  I took Alex's shoes and walked off showing how big of the shoes they were that made me look like a clown with them.  I came back and saw a condom on the ground I go "Alex...*point*" and he goes "Hey Kirby, is that your condom?".  Kirby bends down and picked it up and just laughed kinda nervously.  I cried laughing so hard on Alex's shoulder and Alex goes "Dude that thing expired a month ago, I saw the date when it was on the ground".  Well it just so happens that Kirby is bi, so when Alex says that "Yeah he uses it for protection" I go "From guys.  No wonder he's not allowed at Franki's anymore.  They broke his bed from having sex."  Nicole started crying because SHE was laughing so hard after what I had the nerve to say.  Adela was all telling me why didn't I tell her hi at the Papa Roach concert.  I made up an excuse like "OH well I saw other people at the concert and thought 'maybe she was waving to someone else'." She didn't believe it she goes "DUDE we were all waving at you there wasn't anyone in between us."  That concert was okay....I think Puddle of Mudd was better, but then at this concert it was cool because the lead singer in Papa Roach let 2 little kids on stage and let them dance or whatever on the stage while he was singing a song.  That's the first concert I've seen a singer do that for little kids.  It's kinda funny, guys and girls were hitting on my uncle, lots of drunk people.  There was this girl, who I swear, was STUPID and she wouldn't quit jumping up and down and everytime she would she'd land on my foot.  Then J.D. decided "I'm gonna grab her butt" And he DID.  She stopped for a little and then started again and he grabbed her butt again.  I saw all this happening and just started laughing.  I know this was kinda long and boring but I just had to write something.  LaterZ  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: two friends talk about ORLANDO Bloom GRR Mood: bored  Dude, Spring Break, no computer, no blog.  AHH.  Well yeah, so I learned during this little break... 1. Listen to friends when they tell you not to do something, they're trying to keep you from doing something REALLY stupid.  2. Taboo is really fun, especially when the boy on your team has the same train of thought as you.   Nina: Baby Back- Alex: Ribs  I went to Fiesta Texas AGAIN.  I had fun, except for the fact that WHOLE day I lived off of Chili Cheese stuff.  I had chili cheese nachos, then I had chili cheese fries.  After I ate the fries I decided to do what Shawn and Armando told me NOT to do.  Ride the Scream after I ate, they said I would throw up for sure.  So I rode it, and I was okay afterwards, except little by little I started feeling more and more sicker.  I got to the apartment and called Joseph after I took a bath, I felt like a piece of lead I didn't want to move.  I had that feeling like I was really tired and still couldn't go to sleep.   I also went to Sea World, it was kool I guess.  I didn't get soaked by Shamu, though my sister did, and her little friend Joe (an annoying little boy).  I rode the Great White like...twice.  I'm going to kill my uncle because he's a big CHICKEN!  When we got back from out of town, I decided "I'm going to go buy a gerbil with the money that Rudy gave me."  I walked to the petstore and looked at their smalllllll assortment of gerbils and mice they had.  I found these cute little Teddy Bear Gerbils and I was like I didn't want to just buy one, so I bought two.  I got home and mom wasn't very happy about it, but there was nothing she could do, the store closed RIGHT after I left.  I've been trying to play with them since I got them and they're freaking little mother F-ers.  I swear, one is a total antisocial b**** and the other is like all JUMPY and gets on my arm when I don't want to hold it.  The stupid anti-social one bit me yesterday and made me bleed, and I would've been okay with it if it hadn't had bled so much.  I bled so much I opened the screen door and there was blood on the handle.  OKAY so it wasn't ALOT, but it didn't quit bleeding after 5 minutes.  Even after 2 cubes of ice.  I put a steri-strip (at-home stitching thingy), and I was typing names of songs to download, and I looked and my finger was bleeding again.  I swear that gerbil will 'mysteriously' end up in the cat's food bowl one of these days.    I felt sooooo alive last Friday.  I got to go to the car races!  My friend Robert took me.  Kevin, that one boy I liked from there, was a big MEANIE.  I asked my friend Laurna for chili cheese nachos and Kevin goes "I don't think I want to make her anything".  I was totally ignoring him, acting like he wasn't there, and he had to RUIN IT!  It was a monster truck race, and it was all good because I hadn't been to one.  Hopefully Robert's off next Friday so he can take me again.  It was the best I had ever felt, I just feel like myself when I'm there, I don't have to put on an image or anything, not that I do, but I feel more...open there I guess?  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: The ducks are scaring me, they're going to eat me.   Mood: cheery... New MY Word(s): poppycock (name of some almond snack in the store, I found that word amusing)  My mom bought me this leg pilate/toner thing so Wednesday night I decided to use it.  I was on a roll but then it repositioned itself and popped out from my legs and hit the wall.  I started laughing because mom goes "What, next time I go into the bathroom the mirror will be broken and what will your excuse be?  'It was the pilate toner ring thingy'?".  Let's just say I haven't taken my chances in trying to use that thing again.  Last night was like "Let's all call Nina night".  It was funny enough as it was because I was thinking about Joseph earlier that day complaining to my friend Kelly that he hadn't called me like he said he was, and telling Nicole that Joseph was way cooler than Johnathon.  Well we got out of Target and my mom hands me the cell phone and it had "Joseph C" on it.  I thought it was a missed call so I go "Oh yay he called?".  I saw that it had seconds counting down and I was like "Oh smack, *put the phone to ear* hello??".  It was so funny because he heard me say that so when I got on the phone he goes "What was all that about??".  So we talked all the way home, and around 8:40 the phone rings at the house.  My mom answers it, and goes "Nina it's Frank".  So I have the cell phone on one ear and the phone on the other, talking to Frank (ex boyfriend) and listening to Joseph do his little "tiger rawr" thing.  Everytime he would rawr I would laugh so Frank thought I was laughing at him.  He said that I looked scary in my picture, but I need to send him the new one of me because I cut my hair and whatnot.    Our plans to go to Astroworld this weekend were a bomb.  My grandmother has to work this weekend, that's what stinks about her not-so-new job.  She always has to work on Saturdays, checking on the construction sites and stuff.  So anyways, I'm hoping we can go somewhere else.  It's Springbreak coming up for crying out loud.  We are going back to Fiesta Texas Monday, fun fun.  Maybe we can steal some more balls.  *angel face*  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: people Current thoughts: I'm huunnnggryyy Mood: bored  I don't think it's a very good idea to be singing "I want your girlfriend to be my girlfriend" in the bathtub when you're a girl.  I was singing that song last night because it was on the cd, my mom probably thought I was weird or something, even though she already thinks that, but ANYWAYS.  K well I'm gonna go because I really don't want to look at a computer screen.  LaterZ  *~*Nina*~*

They sell David & Goliath stuff at Spencer's and I'm so happy!  I got sandals to match my "You suck BIG TIME" shirt.  I'm wearing them today at school, maybe I'll get in trouble =).  Well....I'm gonna go cuz it's toooooooo loud in here for me to think.  LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~* PS. My new nickname is HOTLIPS (don't ask, and it's not really my new nickname I just like it)

      Listening to: Kelly and Adam talk Current thoughts: Hi person, how are you? Mood: happy  I had so much fun this weekend!  I went to Fiesta Texas (an amusement park for some who don't know, like Joseph).  I rode on the Rattler, Roadrunner express, Poltergeist, Scream, Frisbee, some weird ride, and another.  I forgot the names, but it was lots.  I rode on the Scream ALOT.  The only thing I hate about that reide is when it stops at the top it gives you no warning as to when it's going to drop you, and my stomach felt all like it was going up.  I saw like....6 people.  And it was funny because the night before we went to this seafood restraunt and I saw this girl there.  Well when I was at Fiesta Texas, this person told me hey and I didn't know who it was because he was a row above me so the next time around I looked up and this boy was looking at me.  It was that girl's ex boyfriend!  My mom goes "Who was that?".  I told her who it was.  Then I saw Allison, the girl I was in soccer with last year, and Laura, the girl I hang out with at the band hall.  Then I saw some boy that I used to walk home with in 6th grade and I don't even know his name.  I also saw some girl, I think her name is Victoria, I don't know but she knows Mark and Megan, I'll have to ask Megan if she actually did go to Fiesta Texas or not.  I made a new friend.  She was the friend's daughter that went along.  We talked and got to know each other, and so we hung out when we went on rides.  When we went on the Roadrunner Express, she was in front of us and this guy in front of her had this hat that fell off.  The bill (hard part, front of it) hit her RIGHT under the eye.  She got a black eye so we were coming up with ways to try to say how she got it, like her mom punched her in the eye or she got in a fight at the park.  I got beat by my own sister!  We were playing this "Fill the coke cup" game and I was so freaking close, and my sister won and got a basketball!!  We went on the Superman Krypton coaster or whatever it's called and after we got off my mom saw this basketball (same my sister had but wasn't ours) and tells this guy Luis "Hey go get my basketball for me".  He fell for it and got it and when we walked off I was laughing because he didn't know he had just stollen a basketball.  He told his wife what happened and goes "Do you know what your friend just did!?  She made me steal a basketball!"  It was soooo funny but hey we got 3 basketballs off this trip.  What else could be better??    I went to the mall yesterday and got lots of makeup.  Yes the best thing for a girl, makeup.  I got this koooollll lipgloss that burns my lips and feels so funny.  I went to Hot Topic and found the PERFECT shoes!  My mom would have bought them but they didn't have my size, it so P-ed me off!  There was this guy at the store, and usually the guys that work at Hot Topic overdo the look.  But this guy was perfect, he didn't have toooooo much.  He told me that he liked my shirt.  It was the "If you have something to say shut up" shirt.    I called Joseph Saturday.  He said he made a girl cry.  They had a dance Friday night and this girl had wanted to dance with him and he didn't know it.  She was standing up near him and tried to talk to him and was stuttering and everything and she ran off crying.  He danced with her, so she was happy I guess.  He just HAD to call his girlfriend when we were on the phone and just had to ask her if I had an accent.  He finds my voice funny because he lives up north and I live here.  He thinks I have a Spanish accent or whatever.  YEAHHH.....right.  I don't.  Alright, I'm gonna go because well....I'm bored.  Bye!  LaterZ  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: Slip-ups are the highlights of my day. Mood: happy  Yesterday I was at the petstore, which moved around the corner from my house, which is fun for me because I can go torture the parrots.  Nah I wouldn't do that, but they're fun, because one of them makes sounds like a frog.  Even my mom thinks so.  Well yeah, so me and my mom and my sister are in a room looking at these baby lovebirds, the kutest little things and I want one.  Since I was looking at the birds and about to ask the guy if he had any applications for me to apply there this summer it came out like this- Me: My mom was wondering if you had any love-  I then caught myself at what I just said, the guy was looking at me like "What did you just say?" So I had to say I was asking for an application.  That, was by far the most embarassing moment ever in a store.  Besides the time I was sexually harassed by a little 2 or 3 year old.  LoL  I got a cage for my baby (Pecan the gerbil), it's bigger and so now I can get her a roommate so she won't be lonely anymore.  Yay  Of all people to see!  I saw Albert, a person that my friend had a crush on in middle school, and dude, he looked at me all funky.  I wanted to just go flick him off and slap him upside the head.  But of course that would set a bad example to my little sister, like I could care?!  Durn it, I should have taken my chance when I could.    *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: people... Current thoughts: this doughnut was good Mood: happy  I finally got my finger to type again.  It took a little pulling last night, and finally got the hanging nail to come off.  It didn't hurt like I thought it would, but now I want a finger condom to keep it from hitting things because when it hits thing it feels all funky feeling.  (finger condom's an inside joke with my mom, they're little things you put on your finger and they look like miniature condoms)  So I decided to be nice to the ex-boyfriend.  Let him have a picture, he wanted it, thought I'd let him have it I guess.  Of course when I was walking with him yesterday Robert decides to say to me "You're talking to him too!?"  I just want to punch him and get it over with.  I could care less if he's like top of the wrestling team.    I got an unexpected letter yesterday.  From my friend Jordan.  I guess all those times from calling and I can never answer made her finally write a letter to me.  Looks like I'll be getting more letters seeing as how Joseph and Keesha probably have mailed off their letters already.    I got pictures taken the other day.  I for one think I look funny, Chris said I look like my mom.  So did Spenser and Kelly and Nicole for that matter.  Robert just took my picture and put it in his wallet.  Yeah.....right.    Amanda keeps on telling me I like girls.  Just now I told her (in front of Nicole) "Oh yes Amanda, I'm gay, I'm just with Mark to cover it up" Nicole looked at me like "Whoa are you serious?"  OF COURSE I'm NOT serious!  Why in the heck of all that is holey (not holy, I'm being all weird today) would I be with Mark if I WAS gay?!  We went through this last year (with Chris and David saying I was a curious lesbian because of my jacket), and we all said I wasn't gay.  Alrighty then.    K then, I forgot all that I was supposed to write on here, and this thing's already gotten long enough.  So LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Current thoughts: Damn fingernail! Mood: p-o-ed and otherwise happy  Let's see....Friday I called Joseph to see if he got my letter, hooray for me he did!  I told him he better write me back or I'd personally fly a plane to where he lives and kick his 'ninja' butt.  (not in those words but I felt like a little ME humor).    I practically slept all Saturday.  There was nothing to do!  Mom was gone all day long and it got me mad because we were supposed to do stuff.  Go places.  Go out of town.  But NO we didn't!    While my mom and sister went to the movies I went to Maria's .  When my mom came home I mentioned Maria barbecuing and maybe she could talk to her.  (of course though it wasn't a sure thing that she was barbecuing, but if I talked to my mom to talk to her, it could happen).  We go to the grocery store to buy some meat because the deal was she bought the meat and Maria would barbecue.  I'm making trips back and forth, getting "stuff" (not gonna say what), and on 1 of my trips I'm carrying a bottle in my pocket, a bottle in my hand and a cat, along with a broken nail with pants trying to unzip all the way.  Man, usually I'm not the type of girl to get all hissy-pissy when it comes to breaking a nail, but when it comes to breaking at the meat, that means war.  The pain isn't like the piercing a belly-button pain where I clenched my sides, NO, this was the cuss out loud kind of pain.  And I know Joseph would just ask me "Would you like some french cries with that whineburger?"  Well guess what, HOLD it all because I don't want it.  When we were eating and watching the 30 minutes thing before the Oscars, I got smart with Leslie:  Leslie- Wow it's so red. Me- No duh, that's why it's called the red carpet.  She looked at me all mean.  Mom's boyfriend said she was ghetto-fying her truck.  Getting the tinted windows, the chrome trim on the tires.  He says "I won't be surprised if you put your last name on the back window."  I told mom "No you'd be putting 'Bear's my bitch' on the window."    You know what?  It's really hard typing without the index finger with the broken finger because I keep making mistakes, so I'll continue tomorrow because this is painful.  Bye!  LaterZ  *~*Nina*~*

      I feel so geeky today!  I'm not wearing my usual kind of shirt.  My hair became the way I didn't want it, it's k, but I wanted to do it like last time.  But...it as kinda my idea to do the cap anyways, so it's part to blame on my half.  We have the stupid state test for the next 3 freaking days.  NOOOO...yeah.  My cat woke me up at 3 this morning.  I was about to kill her so I just threw her butt outside.  I mouthed off to that one girl who talks smack about me.  Wasn't much but it was something.  I'm hoping to do more to piss her off because I'm not going to be nice to her anymore.  K...well I'm gonna go because I can't seem to quit complaining about stuff....LaterZ!

      Listening to: people talking and talking Current thoughts: *blank* Mood: bored  OK, having a cat with kittens is just like having a baby.  The cat insists on going outside (waking me up) at all odd hours of the night.  She got me so p-oed on Friday night because she woke me up at 1 o clock in the morning, and wouldn't quit roaming around my room.  So I locked her in my mom's bathroom while I was watching tv.  After she wouldn't quit banging herself against the door I opened it to find one of her kittens on the floor.  The other in the box of course.  She ran out of the bathroom for a few seconds then grabbed the kitten that was on the floor (looking like she was killing it or at least going to eat it), and carried it into the hallway.  My door wasn't open so she set the kitten on the floor.  I opened the door and she grabbed the kitten and took it and dropped it right onto my bed.  I took it by then that she wanted to keep the kittens in my room.  She wakes me up at 5 in the morning wanting to go outside to eat.  I got mad at this point but didn't say anything, so I took her outside and brought her inside right afterwards.  She wakes me up 30 minutes later and wants to go outside again.  I got really mad by now and so I locked her in the bathroom again, this time putting stuff up against the door hoping that'll stall her from banging herself.  I woke up at 7 and went to check on her as my first instinct.  I found to my surprise that the stuff that i put against the door were gone.  I opened the door and found one of the kittens on the floor, and the other kitten MISSING.  Of course the cat couldn't understand what I was saying when I was yelling at her asking her where the kitten was.  So I turned around and saw something black against the rocking chair.  It turned out to be the kitten, asleep.  When I grabbed this kitten Pewter (mother cat) grabbed the other kitten and took it back into my room.  Now I have a family of kittens in my room, and with a cat who refuses to get them out of it.  We took the kittens outside, she just carried them right back to the door to bring them inside, having the kittens outside ticked her off.  I guess I'll have to deal with being woken up at 4-5 o clock in the morning....GOSH  Man if only Dustin could read this.  We were talking the other day about me having dreams about EVERYONE else, except for someone.  He of course guessed who it was on the first try.  Well...I jinxed it and had a dream about this one person.  GRR!  He only played a small role which was walking right in front of me, but dude, I didn't want him in my dream!  Guess that's what I get for jinxing myself.  *sigh*  Well Chris, I know you won't get this by the time you get to school so I guess I'll see you during the day.  You should call more often, AND you need to bring the notebook to school so we can make a trade.  NOW that I wrote it on here, you can get reminded.  LaterZ!

      How can I be mad or sad on a day like this?  I was worried last night of course, and was afraid something bad happened to my cat.  This morning I went outside, and there she was climbing out from behind this board.  I saw something moving but couldn't see what it was, and lifted the board.  And to my surprise, I saw 2 kittens.  They're so kute!  I took some pics of them and I'll DL them as soon as I can but I don't think I'll continue my ranting, besides that girl was the only girl I was venting my mind out on.  LaterZ cuz I need to do my research.

      I'm really tired of some people talking their shit and acting like they're all that.  (this is for at least 2 people in pe).  There's this one girl in my fclass who acts nice to CERTAIN people, of course I'm not one of them, but why should I care?  I'm not asking her to like me.  Here's how it goes, this one girl is always talking smack about me, I've never given her reason.  She says I'm stingy.  Dude, she's never really ever asked me for much to say I'm stingy.  Out of all the times I've brought cinnamon rolls to class I can say she'sls only really only asked me for some maybe 2 or 3 times, not more than that.  In all those times she asked me I can honestly say I said no once.  That one time I had a reason because I hadn't eaten for a day and a half and was starving and not reaedy to give any food out to anyone.  That same day she asked me for a quarter.  I said no which was the truth, but I had a dollar.  Now...that 's not the shape of a quaerter but when I came back tto class with food she looked pissed. Any other times I had food I would have been nice enough to fork some over if she asked, she never did of course.  The other day I was eating Twang, in case you dont' know what that is it's pickle or lime flavored salt, kind of like lucas, but better.  She aksed me if I could put some on her hot cheetso . You see if it was had been Lucas I'd have gladly put some in the bagf, but I can barely get twang unless I'm with my cousin because my mom won't let me buy it.  I hesitated, then put a tiny bit.  Iheard her telling Aaron that I was "fuckin' pinche" and all this other stuff.  Yesterday she asked me for a quarter.  I had one but wasn't about to give her one because I was tired of putting up a nice front like I never hear the crap she says about me.  She's also said on numerous occasions that I was annoying.  Who gives?  I'm not trying to please her.  She says I'm fucking stingy and I never give her shit.  I wouldn't be talking because she's never offered me any of her hot cheetos, like I'd want them anyways, I hate them.  But if she thinks I'm about to offer her my stuff she's got another thing coming for her.    I'll continue tomorrow, I dont' have anymore time BYE!

      K so I haven't updated my "J" lately.  Yeah...the school won't let me VIEW it, I can update it but not view it.  That really sucks.  Chris thinks I've dressed up today since I wore earrings.  NO.  And I've started reading those mangas, they're kool, and no Mark I don't need help.  I learned that my mom really can make me do things I don't wanna do, like pluck my freaking toes!  Yeah...embarassment majorly.  My cat should pop anyday soon, hoping she has lots of kitties so I can have lots of fun.  OH, I can't check who writes on my "J" so....don't comment, if u do...Chris will have to tell me lol.  I'll TRY And find a way to check out my "J".  Well kkkkk....bye

Yeah, it's boring as usual.  ROMCO races are this weekend and I doubt I can go.  K well I'm going to go becasue I don't know what to talk about...yeah it's that boring.  LateRZ

      Now I know why I don't wear bright colors.  It makes me look sick.  My friend Chris (other Chris) even said it was true.    So the other day we're driving to my mom's friend's house and we pass by this street called Horne, my sister was saying all the street names and instead of calling the street "Horn" she called it "Horny".  I found this hilarious.  Yeah...something so boring could be so funny.  I felt my cat's stomach the other day.  She's pregnant.  It was cool because I actually felt her kittens kick.  I also took my two gerbils to my neighbor's house.  I thought the dog Honey was going to want to eat my gerbils because I put my gerbils on the couch with her and at first she was like "Get the fuck away from me" but when both the gerbils went up to her nose and touched it she got interested.  She started putting her paws on their back and started licking them like they were her own puppies.  It was the cutest thing.  I'm not going to try that with my cat of course, she'll eat them on site I know her all tooooo well.    Yesterday during lunch I made fun of my friend Nicole (as always) and said that she was going to work at Hooters and wear a waterbra.  Then me and Kelly started talking about pudding-filled waterballoons.  I got the idea from that movie Now and Then.  I started telling Kelly "Yeah, I'm going to come to school with pudding filled waterballoons and then people will ask me if I got breast implants."  I turned around and asked Robert if a girl he liked were to stuff her bra what would he rather her stuff it with, jello or pudding?  He said jello, then he goes "Hey I saw that in a movie before!  The girl stuffed her bra with pudding or whatever"  I guess I shouldn't tell a guy who knows why I'm asking that question.    Well...I have been slacking off lately, but I'm going to have to slack off more because it's Easter Break, as is everyone else's probably.  But at least other people get to use their computers.  I feel sorry for my friend Joseph because they've taken his Spring Break away.  His break started today and it's Easter Break, but it's also his spring break.  Yeah....K, well LaterZ!  Chris, you need to call me and invite me to the park.  LoL  here's my friend ashley's live journal, i can't get this to work so i'll do it later,  urlLink Ashley's LiveJournal

      Saturday I made a complete and total fool of myself.  I went to my friend Catherine's birthday party and we went to the pool hall and everyone else was playing pool.  I decided to go ahead and try and I missed the white ball the first time.  And then they made me do it again and I missed it again, both times hitting another ball into the hole.  I got so mad I ran to the chair I was sitting at before and started crying.  Over something so STUPID.  Yeah...that was the highlight of my day.  Well actually no, while I was in the bathroom at home I hit a fly with a brush, that kept me occupied for 5 minutes straight, trying to hit the fly with the brush.  Yeahh......bored me.  K well This was fast, gotta go cuz the bell's gonna ring in like a minute.  LaterZ

      I need a massage so bad.  I've worked out the last 2 days and I'm in the worst kind of pain.  I can't find my bed buddy and my mom threw away alll the long socks, which is BAD because now I can't make a home-made bed buddy to heat up and put on my muscles.  Chris, I tried to call you!  TWICE!  BUT NO ONE ANSWERS!?  Gah.  I've gotten hooked on Friends, and I've even learned some phrases.  When someone says "I think we should see other people" means "Haha I'm already seeing someone" "we should do this again sometime" means "You'll never see me naked again" Then there's the usual "It's not you" means "It's is you"  Well I'm sore and don't want to type, Chris....uhh..I'll try and call you this weekend IF I can.  And you better ANSWER!  LaterZ

      Uneventful weekend, except for the fact I finally went to the car races.  I saw the guy that used to like me and he looked...the same I guess, except for the spiked hair.  I take it his mom finally let him spike his hair, the SAME mom who didn't want him hanging out with me because she thought I looked 'preppy'.  Robert's going to leave me and I'm sad.  *tear*  I won't ever get to see him again unless he retires from the Navy and that'll be a long time probably because I see how long it is for my friend Jorge's dad to retire.  Every year or two his dad says he'll retire in the next year or so.  Every year it's the same, he ends up having to stay another few more years.  It's not that I'm trying to be selfish, it's just...I'll miss the person that I can talk to the most about things.  But..right now I'm in one of those I want to bitch about myself moods, so before things get started I might as well end them now.

      I rethought something on the popularity of 1st graders.  So think, the kutest, smartest, popularist girl in the grade (1st) has the koolest crayons.  EVERYONE wants to use them.  That would make her popular.  I also experienced that bit of popularity.  And come to think of it, I've seen that girl around the school.  But she's not as popular as she was in elementary school, because elementary school was on a 1 school basis, and once u hit high school from middle school there's MORE people and more groups.  All I know about that one single girl is she turned bi and she's goth and all that other smack.    OH and popularity also makes you bite your nails.  Guess I was never popular, I never bit my nails.    K added my input on that, laterZ *~*TeEnIe*~*

      So I was thinking about how popularity was judged upon the years.  Elementary school, in order to be cool with the "earlier" gamers, it meant you had to have a game system higher than a SNES.  Which after that would have been the N64.  You had to have been cool to have that one.  Then I thought, well what about in school in general.  So here's what I came up with:  Kindergarten- You were judged upon how many crayons you had, what color scissors you had. Bragging rights and props to the kids who actually tried out for the science fair and got first place IN kindergarten. 1st Grade- Boys: Who you got your first kiss from.  (yes this did happen, I remember) Girls: If you were the girl to kiss the guy. 2nd Grade: Who could get away with the most stuff and not get in trouble 3rd Grade: Anything that didn't have to get in trouble.  Then again, if you got a referrel you were cool (first of the bad boys etc.) 4th Grade: If you were a new student, you automatically became popular.  Having a twin also helped this little detail a bit. 5th grade: If you had a gameboy color with any cool games and were able to sneak it to school you might've been considered cool AMONG your friends, but not among the grade.    and in concluding all these grades I also thought for all the grades that if you were a girl and were able to wear makeup without getting noticed, you were considered cool.  But then again you had to be one of the cute girls in the grade too.  6th grade- Girls: First girl to have a boyfriend and keep him for at least a month.  Then get rumors had about you and that boyfriend.  Wearing the coolest makeup and looking cool with it.  (Sad to say I wasn't either, I didn't like to wear makeup and I hated boys, but then I hung around with them at lunch...) Boys- Whoever had the most Pokemon cards.  Whoever had the girlfriend that got rumors (and he was mentioned in them).  Then also, if you were the guy to strip in front of your last period class, you were always remembered. 7th grade: Whoever had a boyfriend/girlfriend  the longest.  Talk back to the teachers and not get sent to the office. 8th grade: All the things that went for the other grades, and then picking on all the 6th graders.  These are what I've observed in the high school years:   9th Grade: Being able to go through the year without being called a fish.  Being part of a clique that has all the popular people in it.  Instant group of people (mostly smart) if you went to the Athena schools (Wynn Seale and Baker).   10th Grade: Surviving 9th grade without getting held back.  Start skipping and not getting caught (starts in 9th but usually people are always caught) 11th grade: Definetely skipping and not getting caught (if you did you'd probably be mocked).   12th grade: Skipping and having a car to do it with (considering the security guard or camera doesn't see you during the act)  Of course 11th and 12th were a little short and unthought because I haven't been in those grades.  Maybe Chris can give me hints on 11th.  Help me out here Chris!  K well I need to go and b**** out a gamer magazine for something.  I'll write later  *~*TeEnIe*~

He grabbed my hand and just shocked me with his little "taser-camera".  It left to white marks on my finger where it hit.  That thing felt like it was pulling on me and they said it was like less than a second until I started screaming.  It felt like more than a second!  It like....felt like 2 seconds.  Man.  Well yeah, I'm leaving right now because everyone seems to be getting sick.  My sister had a 103 fever and my friend Kelly isn't coming to school today because...she's sick.

      Listening to: GreenDay - Basket Case Current thoughts: Gosh...sure is boring Mood: hungry  So I haven't updated in awhile...yeah.  Summer smells for me.  My gerbil died on the last day of school and the other gerbil was lost.  I was playing with my gerbil Pecan and then I found the other gerbil on the floor, skinny as heck.  My sister's kitten got ran over.  My gerbil Pecan died.  My kitten got ran over.  And...yeah.  I'm glad turtles are low maintnence.  I have one gerbil left, and now I have to lock the cage all the way because it's like "Houdini", finds a way out somehow.  In fact, that's his name.   My cousin Aaron came over for a week and my cat hated it.  By the 3rd day she learned to run when he came up to her.  All he did was "Kitty kitty, kiss kitty" and he'd kiss her back.  Then he'd grab her and try to carry her around.  My neighbor's dog was ecstatic at first to have a new kid to play with.  UNTIL she learned to stay away.  And to get my cousin away from her, she'd play dead.  My neighbor's chihuahua didn't like him, she hates kids period.  She'd bite at him everytime he tried to touch her.  He didn't learn, and would keep on touching her.   I got a PS2, and now I only have 1 game for it.  It's kool because it's made after the manga I like to read.   .Hack part 1//Infection  is the name of the game.   Well I'm sure no one wants to hear about my summer anymore.  Here you go jordan I updated! lol LaterZ  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: Edwin McCain - I'll Be Current thoughts: Finally... Mood: happy/sad  OMG OMG OMG the concert was so freaking awesome. I was not even 2 feet from Rick Springfield! Thanks to CSE, i wouldn't have been that close if it weren't for him. And DURN IT. I was stupid and didn't think this but I could've recorded the concert on my blog. DURN IT! *hits head repeatedly* Perfect ending to a perfect night!!! I saw the guy from Cracker Barrell *smiles and blushes* But dude this concert was WAY freaking better than the Papa Roach concert. nothing was compared to it. Thanks CSE for pushing me closer...but i'm still mad at you, for 3 reasons  1.) You didn't catch the shirt that went over your head 2.) You didn't make me touch Rick Springfield 3.) ...and I forgot the 3rd, but there was a third, right now i'm talking to ashley so I forgot, but i'll remember soon!  But I still wuv ya :-D. lol. We gotta do this more. Not concerts, but you know you know, something cool. There's Funtrackers next week! You better go! Or I'll hurt you so freaking bad hehehe. *smiles evily*  ~*~Nina~*~ P.S. People forgot! It's my bday and people have forgot only Zeke and Frank have told me happy bday, and I think CSE too. BYE  And this was for last nite

      Listening to: Eve 6 - Inside out  Current thoughts: I don't know what to believe anymore  Mood: ticked off   Reminders&nbsp; and rememberences   The harsh reminders of the past.&nbsp; I look in my backyard and I still picture the 2 swingsets in my backyard.&nbsp; I see myself 9 years ago scared to go on the monkey bars, having to have my dad carry me on his shoulders to just act like I'm going across.&nbsp; Then I see myself jumping up and down excited because I did it by myself.&nbsp; I see the playhouse that used to be there, the day me, Alex, and Chelsea played truth or dare in there.&nbsp; I look in the front yard and I remember everything that went on there.&nbsp; The day we dug up the front lawn because someone lost their necklace there and we got carried away with the metal detector and found lots of things but the necklace.&nbsp; I remember when I played baseball with my dad, kickball with the neighbor kids, 4th grade playing football with the boys.&nbsp; I remember when I tried to mow the lawn and lost control only to run into the fence and have a lizard jump on my face.&nbsp; Running into my neighbor's house because I had cut myself with glass and I was afraid to face my parents.&nbsp; Crying in kindergarten because I was a skunk in the school play and the people who played horses were making fun of me.&nbsp; Crying in the 1st grade because the boys were saying "Nina and Steven sitting in a tree..."&nbsp; Throwing little tantrums at my neighbor's house because I lost at dominos.&nbsp; Accidently killing that little bird because I was trying to keep it from running away.&nbsp; The day I woke up at 4 in the morning only to be sent back to my room because my dad didn't want me to see him sick and then waking up the next morning with my grandmother there because he went to the hospital.&nbsp; The day my mother left, how I insisted on going to school the next day only to be sent back home because I was sick.&nbsp; All the times I embarassed myself arguing with Erica.&nbsp; 6th grade being the best time of my school life, not being shy to talk to anyone, not being afraid to do anything, being able to talk to guys without caring what they thought of me.&nbsp; I remember when I ran across the gym because I thought I was short enough to go under the volleyball net without bending, and I fell right in front of the guy I liked.&nbsp; Falling in algebra class in front of the guy I liked yet again when I got stuck in the desk somehow and I hit my head on the next desk.&nbsp; The little experiments I used to do with my uncle, getting in trouble for making that concoction that ruined the next door neighbor's white truck, turning it permanently pink for the rest of its car years.&nbsp; Going to car races, meeting new people and feeling like&nbsp;I could be myself there more than anywhere else.&nbsp; Buying my dad that one real father's day gift, better than just a card like my kid years.&nbsp; I felt happy because I thought of getting this gift all on my own, well after seeing the commercial for it.&nbsp; It was one of those picture cakes, a picture of me, him and my sister.&nbsp; Meeting Joseph...and getting to know him.&nbsp; He seemed like the perfect guy, still does, but I'm too young for that.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  I think that should conclude for now.&nbsp; I was in a thinkative mood today...I was mad for a long time&nbsp;.&nbsp; And I mowed 2 whole lawns, front and back, and it didn't help out my mood.&nbsp; It&nbsp;only made me more sick than I already was...LaterZ people  &nbsp;  ~*~Nina...~*~

      July 30 I get to go see Rick Springfield in concert.  In case you're wondering who he is he's a singer from the 80's who sang "Jesse's Girl" only the best freaking song from the 80's...lol well not the best, it's behind "My Ding-a-ling" by Chuck Berry, I think that's the name.  I also hope I get to see Evanescence on August...8th I think.  And hopefully Linkin Park on August 21.  If I go I hope to somehow bump into my friend Michelle who's going but I'm sure that's impossible because there'll be so many people there.  I get to go to Schlitterbahn around July 26-28 with Robert so that'll be cool.  I'll just have to wear a towel so he can't see me in a bikini lol.  I went to Fiesta Texas only to get rained out at the end of the day.  I was mad because I didn't take the chance to ask this boy to go on the Tornado with me.  But by the end of the day I was just glad I got to go with my bestest friend.    The boy at Cracker Barrell now knows I think he's cute.  This is embarassing because you know...now I can't show my face there without blushing anytime he looks at me.  He said I was gonna grow up to be a hottie but that I was too young lol, he's like 19...I think.    I went to play POOL the other day with Frank, Dalilah, my mom, Zeke and another guy named John.  It was the koolest.  I only got to play once...and lost.  But I was playing against Zeke, he helped me and tried to give me tips so it was all good.  (I had to redo this post since SOMEBODY pointed out we played pool, lol)  well...LaterZ!  *~*Nina*~*

      Listening to: trying to listen to the similarity that Yes Maybe says i have in my voice to Hilary Duff Current thoughts: I don't sound like her Mood: weirded  me: ahh my voice sounds funny, go to my gerbil yes maybe: (the hell...?) me: gerbil...wait, i mean blog  I got my cell back so now i audioblog.  I went to San Marcos today and went shopping.   $100 purse $120 on school clothes $30 or more on regular clothes $8-9 on a neopets handheld game that was on sale at KB-Toys since it's closing A whole day of walking almost seems so painful, but it was worth it.  A whole day of text messaging was fun.  My mom gave me medicine and she didn't tell me it would make me drowsy so i fell asleep in the car.  Not to forget that I had put my cell phone on autoanswer and had the earpiece in my ear so if someone called it would answer and they would've heard me sleeping.  I called Radio Disney on the way there and they answered and I froze because I didn't know what to say so i told the girl if she could play Simple Plan - Perfect.  I'm such a geek!  I saw Ashley at Peter Piper Pizza yesterday (she works there).  Thank you for the blinky-bouncing ball!  You're the best! :-D  Of course from my audioblog you heard about my little mishap from the footmassager thinking it was a back massager.  My voice sounds so funny.  Nina: Pizza hut Ashley: Yes, I would like to order a New Yorker- Nina: Go to Peter Piper and order your pizza there since you work there you traitor!  lol I thought that was funny.

      I had a fight with Frank about his friend saying I was cute.  Okay, for one, for all of you who say I put myself down too much, I don't put myself down, I just simply state the truth.  I don't think myself as cute, and if a guy says i'm cute, ok fine i'm cute, but i'm not going to be one of those self absorbed girls who struts their stuff thinking "I'm cute, I know it, everyone knows it, look at me I'm miss hotty pants".  But to set the story straight, I DON'T THINK OF MYSELF AS CUTE ONE SINGLE BIT! Now on to other things.  I'm leaving, for a while, again.  No net for me.  No updating my blog.  Ahh but it's k, nobody will miss me.  Yes Maybe and the Lemonator are funny, go check them out.  So anyways, yes I shall go...LaterZ  *~*Teenie*~* (I had Bawls today...but I'm on the nothing-hyperness right now, where I just sit there, hyper, but don't do anything...)

      OK all I wanna do is rat out how much guys stink, and not all you guys (if you're reading this you probably don't....not unless you're someone).  But yea...So there's this guy, who I liked a while back, and I..well liked him.  He seems so cool, but gosh it SUCKS!  He has no idea how I felt, or how I might even be feeling.  I don't think I like him anymore, no not even.  It's kinda like when I first met him, I kinda had a crush on him right away...I'm not one to like to say soulmates or "love at first site" as they call it cuz I think that's a bunch of bull but like HELLO I can't get it off my conscience.  If I don't tell him, I'll burst.  It's crazyness.  I don't know...I mean I feel like I like someone (another guy) but I don't want to be so stupid as to want a long distance relationship because you know...those suck (but if you're surviving one, then IGNORE THIS).  In every way he seems so perfect, but it's like...he's not there to hug, to even get to talk to face to face.  And Chris, don't go about saying how "OH good you're going along with my 'no seeing people who I can see face to face'" because I will so not talk to you.  But I mean, I'm too young for that sort of thing, to even think about that sort of stuff, I mean yeah I'm 15 and stuff...but no, ok this is leading nowhere, I SHALL LEAVE!!!  ~Nina (not even a little decoration :@ (msn face))

      Listening to: Mya - Fallen  If I can save as many people as I can from wasting almost or more than 2 hours of their life and money then here it is.  Do NOT go to see "The Village" It's the suckiest movie there could ever be, next to "Blair Witch Project 2".  If you've seen the previews for this movie it makes it seem scarier.  Bull!  It's nowhere NEAR scary.  I've seen scarier, come on.  And I'm never scared by movies.  I mean come on...It's about this freaking Amish-like community that the 'elders' made up a monster in the woods to keep people from getting out of the village and going out into the REAL world.  It's like they're pilgrims or whatnot.  The monster's not real, hate to break it to you people.  I'm sorry if I ruined the movie for you but it's not even worth it's time or money or even the money invested to make this movie.   On a happier note, I'm sure people would see me weird once they hear that I spent almost 2 dollars on a Tekken 3 game trying to beat this computer.  I was so mad because I couldn't beat this one guy on there.  Quarter after Quarter and there was no advancement in my getting any closer to killing this guy.  I gave up and stomped off to my hotel room mad.

      Listening to: Jojo - Use My Shoulder Current thoughts: ...dunno, cookies taste gooooood Mood: happy  Man was I stupid.  I walked into Taco Bell.  Well...the door opens RIGHT onto my knee and I almost yelled out "F*ck!" But I said it under my breath and instead of yelling I grabbed the edge of the trashcan and started laughing.  LAUGHING?!  It's my defense mechanism for when I get hurt.  6th grade falling out of my desk, couldn't quit laughing.  And that was in front of my crush then.  Then again later on in that grade I thought I was short enough to run under the volleyball net and then I ran right into it in front of my crush AGAIN.  I started laughing then too, then ran to the girls dressing room cuz I was embarassed.  I had fun, my cousin Aaron can't say Nina so he says "Nini" (as you can hear from the audioblog).  He punched me in the eye, and threw a hat at me.  I paid him back by throwing the hat at his head.  He wasn't happy and he ran under the table hiding.   k LaterZ  ~*~Nina~*~  ps...GILMORE GIRLS RULES!  (disc 1/6)
