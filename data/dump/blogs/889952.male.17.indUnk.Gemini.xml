      Sunday Sunday Sunday! You know what? I broke my streak of writing a journal entry a day by not writing yesterday, and I had that going since I started...what do I have to say for myself? Hmmm, oh well. Chris and Mike stayed the night last night, we had a blast. We stayed up really late and wigged out. We got to the point where everything was funny to us. I was playing Super Mario Bros (yes the original), and I called one of those canon things a machine and we cracked up forever at the word MACHINE, say it out loud....hahaha crazy word. This morning when we woke up my parents weren't home, and they didn't come home forever, so we were free to do whatever we wanted like all day. We ordered a pizza and watched a little of the Dolphins-Chiefs game, Dolphins lost!!! that sucked. Later on when he left Mike peeled out in reverse in my driveway...in his dad's car...with his dad in the passenger seat...what a kook. In addition, when Chris went home, he didn't bring his boxing gloves because he couldn't find one of them. LOL! I don't know why that's so funny to me, but ya know... and no I didn't hide his boxing glove.(I know that's what you were thinkin)  Now for my next subject...MEGA MAN 1, IT IS AWESOME!!!!!! That's right, I'm talking about the first Mega Man game ever, now that is old school my friends. I started playing it today and I couldn't stop. I beat the whole game in like 6 hours. Take that for all you wussie a$$ fags that say Mega Man 1 is the most difficult in the series, everyone said it takes about a week to beat, pshhh yeah right, maybe if you are a freaking dumba$$ that can't remember simple patterns and gets scared when a game moves too fast. Go play Winnie the Pooh or something, fags. And if it is the hardest game in the series then the rest of em should be extremely easy for me...Sorry about freaking out like that, I was under the impression that the game was going to be really hard (I read this at various places). The game was challenging, but it just wasn't as hard as it was cracked up to be. That game is so fun though, I highly recommend it to anyone that is any good at video games (because it is pretty hard). I must say, whenever I beat the game I was so into it, and so serious, but I was yelling crazy sh*t. Like: "what're you missin? I'll show you how it's done!"/ "I derive my just powers by the consent of the governed!"/ "You're mine now, you belong to me!". Oh man this one is funny. On the final form of the last boss I was using the cutter beam thing and whenever I dealt the final blow I yelled "Cutter rocks you kook!", haha it was awesome as hell. And the whole time the credits were rolling, I danced the mightiest dance I have ever danced, seriously. I wigged out, I was bustin some of the craziest moves known to man. It was extra cool because I had socks on, and I was on tile, so I was slidin all around and stuff. That was probably the best end of game celebration by anyone ever, let alone me. Well, at the least I haven't been so happy about beating a game (or that happy in general) in a long time. I can't wait to start playing, and beating, the rest of the Mega Mans...ohhhh yeaaa.   I did have a couple other things to talk about, like the mysterious phone call I recieved, and some stuff about ROMs. But I'm in such a good mood that I'd rather end this on a good note, like the one it's at. Party on!

      Its Friday...! School didn't matter much today, took notes in Science, sneaked on the internet all day in Computers, did a bunch of work in History, and did a test in Math. But I did laugh a lot today. In History Chase was crackin me up with a story about him getting his nuts caught on the rope swing at the pits. In math we played a game that was reminiscent of musical chairs, I'll spare you the details but I will say that is was mighty fun and mighty funny. The coolest thing about it was it gave Molly Beck a reason to get up and run around the room, even Zac will tell you, it was awesome. Zac and Chris came over after school for a brief amount of time, nothing incredibly cool happened, but ya know. I talked to Jesseca for a while, but she said she was goin to Jessica's house (despite the fact that she's grounded), so I dunno what she did tonight. For hours I sat around and listened to music mindlessly, until Tommy came over. Now let me tell ya a little about this Tommy character. Whenever I moved here from Michigan, I was like 7, one of the first people I met was Tommy. We used to hang out all the time back in the day, he lived 2 blocks away from me. I remember so much stuff we used to do. I recall a couple times where we stole mass amounts of unripe oranges off of people's orange trees,cut and squeezed them into a big kool-aid container, and drank em. Good times. Well eventually he moved to Deltona and then he moved again with his mom to Port Orange, during this time of about 3 years, I didnt see him at all. Then one day, about a year ago, he shows up at my house and we hang out and film some skits. Then I didn't see him again until today, when he came over at about 8:00. He just asked what i've been up to and stuff, he said he skateboards all the time, he also said he's a big fan of Super Mario Sunshine, which is cool. He said he was gonna stop by Sunday so we could hang out, but you never know with Big Tom, for all I know it will be another year before I see him.  A little while ago I felt really shitty, I don't know if I was tired, or depressed or what, but I didn't feel like doing anything so I decided to go for a walk. And go for a walk I did. I walked all around my neighborhood and jogged around the central park trail twice. Then I walked over near Jesseca's house to tip over the port o pody, something I do all the time, but I always go on bike, i've never done it walking. This time I didn't run afterwards either, I usually hop on my bike and ride out. This time though I just walked away calmly, and I wanted someone to come out and say something, I felt like getting in a fight anyways. I was hoping cars would stop or some teenager would start something with me so I could kick somebody's ass. This attitude reflects the kind of mood I was in perfectly. I walked by Jesseca's house too, but I dont think she was home because hardcore john's silhouette wasn't visible in her bedroom window. Well she could've been sleeping, but it was only 9:30ish, especially weird since it's a Friday night. I got the sh*t scared out of me on my way home too. A car came up behind me and rode by all fast and then I heard some loud noise so I turned around and I saw some big animal chasing me, it startled me so much that my heart starting beating really hard and fast...you know the feeling. As it turns out it was just a large piece of paper, flying low to the ground, pushed by the wind made by the passing truck. But it was still pretty cool, because I haven't gotten a good scare like that in a while.   Me and Chris are going to the Dashboard Confessional concert at the House of Blues next Thursday. That is gonna be hella awesome because they are one of my favorite bands. Probably my favorite right now. I don't think they're gonna play any of the unreleased songs that I listen to all the time, but their cd rocks, so it should be cool anyways.... Th-tha-tha-tha-thathatha-thats all folks. But before I go, I wanted to let everyone know that I noticed a grammatical error in the Declaration of Independance. Where it says "all men were created equal" that is wrong. It should be "all men were created equally". Ask an English teacher (actually a professor would be a better person to go to, because sometimes high school teachers can be kind of dense) if you don't believe me, they'll tell you. I thought that was worth mentioning because although it is a great document, it goes to show you that even smart, famous people like Thomas Jefferson make mistakes.

      I couldn't decide whether I should write or not today because I didn't think anything really happened that was worth mentioning, but then I remembered some stuff, so it should be all right. So if this sucks, don't bother telling me, I already know.  Today was a pretty normal school day, academic wise. Physics was cool, had to do some work, but I didn't mind. The Navy came into Computers today (but I already saw them in another class). It was alright, I always like to hear what they have to say, and besides I got the day off, so who am I to complain? History was fun as always, because Mr. Eddy is the man. I always seem to favor the History teachers the most for some reason, maybe I just like History... Math was actually ok today, because my teacher was giving people candy to perform their special talents in front of the class. Two things stood out from the crowd. This black kid Marquis (stereotypical black person name by the way) can kick himself in the back of the head, he's showed us before, but this time there was a twist. Today he kicked himself in the head as usual, but upon contact he screamed like a girl. It was crazy because whenever you bend your head/ neck back its hard to make a high pitched sound, so he kept trying forever and my teacher kept telling him to do it over and over until he got it right. His voice was cracking and he made a bunch of odd screeching sounds And if you've never seen someone kick thereself in the back of the head and scream like a girl, let me tell ya, its quite a site to see. Then this kid Nick (the skinniest kid in the world, seriously) did some messed up contortionist crap. He connected his hands behind his back, and with some quick, jerky, squirmy, and flat out nasty movements he brought his hands, still connected, over his shoulders and then straightened his arms out again (they were in some crazy tangled up knot). Throughout the whole performance everyone in the class was like "ewwww", "ahhh" and "what the fu*k!". Then some other kid did it, and he was all happy, but nobody cared because Nick's looked much much weirder. Oh man during lunch we were talking about some of the craziest sh*t ever, it was one of the craziest conversations (it was more of a debate but eh) we've had in a long time. So crazy in fact, that I wont reveal the subject matter due to fear of getting my Journal deleted off the server for innapropriate content. Let's just say it involved Lance Armstrong, Hulk Hogan, A 30x30 foot room whose floor was littered with bars of soap, a big nasty disease ridden fat guy, and the 10 hottest girls in the world.  I started reading War of the Worlds today. I didn't get very far, but it has got to be the most boring book of all time! It might be because i'm at the beginning , but I had a hard time bringing myself to read it, and even more trouble sitting through every single freaking page! I think its because of the journalistic, first person nature of the narrative. This style leaves no room for humor, there hasn't been even one attempt at a joke yet. It sucks enough without grammatical and spelling errors, but not to worry, it has plenty of those too. For anyone who thinks H.G. Wells is such a great author, you can suck it, because he can't write for sh*t. This book makes simple things like walking around school, seem interesting and fun in comparison to reading it. That is the only reason I would reccomend this book, otherwise stear clear of War of the Worlds! Woohoo I finally made my Ataris cd. I've wanted to make it for a couple weeks, but I never got around to it because I was busy, busy wiggin. And get this: I fit 31(!) songs onto the cd! Isnt that crazy? well it's crazy if you know anything about cd burners and how much cds hold. That's the most i've heard of, not counting skits and stuff. I have a cd with 22 and I thought that was a lot, and I have another with 26, but 31, wow. I thought I would have to cut out some songs because I had too many, but I ended up adding 3 extra songs at the end...yessiree, pretty cool stuff .  That's pretty much all for today, well actually there's more, but I think I've bored you enough for one day.

      Before I talk about my day I have to talk about a movie I just watched,  because at the moment it is foremost in my mind. I just watched the Virgin Suicides, so what did I think? First I must say that before seeing it I heard nothing but bad reviews from Justin and my sister, but I never really take someone else's opinion on something, especially a movie. This time I was right, I knew I would like it, and I knew those two must have not watched it or understood it or something. Because personally I thought the movie was great. I thought it was thoughtful, curious, tragic, and most of all, realistic. This movie is really good at portraying teenage life and things that happen in it could happen easily in real life, and i'm sure they do. This movie surprised me in a variety of ways. The cast, which I thought would be full of low-end, bad actors, was actually pretty good. It included up and coming stars such as Josh Hartenette, Kirsten Dunst, and Hayden Christensen (who?), the last guy is Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars Episode 2. And the girls were really hot in it, which probably contributed the most to my liking of the movie. Blah Blah Blah, had enough of my big words and English paper style writing? Me too. Ummm I went to Wal-Mart today and got a surge protector for my room (ooh how exciting!) and the new EGM magazine. This is the last EGM I will buy on newstands for 2 years, because I got a subscription, and I was only buying this one to make sure I didnt miss an issue in between the gap of sending my subscription form and recieving my first issue in the mail. Yep Yep Yep. When I was at Wal-Mart I walked buy some Arab dude and he whispered some crazy sh*t in my ear along the lines of "whoop/ shwoop" and I was like "what the f**k, I'll kill you b**ch" and he was like "you do not tell me da f**k, you do not ever tell me da f**k, b**ch" then he charged at me like he was the last of the Mohicans or some sh*t. So I moved out of the way like a spanish bull-fighter and he ran into a big rack of TVs. When he turned around I yelled "watang!" and hit him with a boot to the face. Then he was laying on the ground all doubled over and I got up close to his ear and said "who's the b**ch now?" and strutted off. True story......I sure do like that Jesseca girl. Hey Jesseca!  I could say so much more, but I'll leave it at that for tonight because it's late and I am going to be a freaking zombie at school tommorow if I dont go to sleep soon. So peace to mah homies, fool.

              Haha i've got an online journal now. It's not as flashy as livejournal, but its free and theres no hassle with getting a passcode and crap. It's alright though I guess. Anyways this is my first time writing in this biotch. Hopefully by reading my journal you will get a good insight into my brain and wacked out thought process. But most likely, you freaks will skim through it and dismiss it as nonsense and get warped perceptions of me based on your own assumptions. Either way, it should be a fun experience for everyone.          I'll try to veer away from writing what happened to me during my day in the middle of the day, because you never know what might happen later on in that day. Another thing I would like to adress is cussing (or cursing, whatever floats your boat). I do cuss a lot, as my closest friends know, and if I talk like I regularly do on this journal I will be kicked off on the first day I use it. So I'm gonna do the whole f*$#k, s%@t, a$$, thing and hope that is acceptable. But in the immortal words of Mr. T: "Enough Jibba-Jabba", and on with the actual journal.

      I'll cut directly to the chase, no bullshitting. Today was an odd day at school, because Zac, Louie, and Chris weren't there(well if they were there, I didn't see them) It's weird that they all didn't go on the same day, but they weren't even in cahootz. You would think that I would have nobody to hang out with, but I was surprised how many people actually were still there at lunch. At Fazolis it was Matt, Mike, Dan, Gabe, Ricky, and I. So I was anything but bored or lonely. Now think about what it's like at Fazolis on a normal day, it's madness. I hung out with Mike for the rest of lunch and we spent the whole time looking for a snack machine because Mike wanted something. When we found one that had what he wanted it gave him something different than he input. It was funny as hell. Then he went up to Mr. Lily and tried to complain about getting some crazy cheese balls because thats not the button he pressed. Mr. Lily is like 180 years old so he didn't understand he was just like "That's what you wanted right?" and Mike's like "yea...." and we walked off. So he just gave the cheese balls to John Kinder. John was like "No I'll pas....Thank you" and took em with a big smile on his face. I'm not sure why that was so funny to me, but I laughed. In case you don't already know, I say I am going to talk about my day at school, but I only talk about lunch.  Halloween is coming up quicker than a nigger in a swimming pool. Of course that's not very quick, since they can't swim, but ya know.. I don't think kids my age should be going trick or treating, and that's exactly why I am going(I encourage everyone to go trick or treating, it's free candy right, so why not?). This year should be the funnest one yet for 2 reasons. One: we're gonna be driving around in Louie's car instead of walking around the whole frickin neighborhood. Two: Me, Chris, and Louie are all dressing up in small, tight ass, children's Power Rangers costumes. Chris is the blue ranger, I'm the red ranger (which is traditionally the leader, yay!) and Louie is the pink ranger. LoL he's the pink ranger. The funny thing is, these things are so tight that when we put em on you can see the outline of our package hardcore style (in other words we are gonna be blatantly flaunting our dicks in front of everyone). Oh well...and if anyone laughs at us they won't think it's too funny when they get their candy stolen from a trio of big, tight costumed wearin Power Rangers. Especially the pink one. If any adults say anything, we'll run em over. So watch out for us on Halloween, GO GO POWER RANGERS!!!  Ahem, at the moment I am going to talk about a few movies that I watched over the weekend. 7 movies to be exact, 6 that Me, Chris, Louie and Zac rented, and 1 that my sister rented. Yes, we rented 6 movies, pretty crazy huh. That's probably the most movies I've rented all at once, but the deal is 6 movies for 6 days for 6 bucks. Not bad, we couldn't pass it up. We were in the mood to watch some scary movies I guess because 5 out of the 6 were horror flicks. These included: Phantasm, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, Ed Gein, Dawn of the Dead, and The Unnamable. The other one we rented was Jackie Brown, you can classify that under whatever genre you want, because I dunno what it is, I would say crime though. Also, my sister happened to rent the movie 40 Days and 40 Nights, so I watched that too. You are probably thinking "he better not review every single one of those movies, that will take forever". If you are, then you're right that would take forever, but only if I did each one in depth. So I'll be brief... (If you don't care about movies then you can skip this next paragraph)   Phantasm : This is one of those crazy 80s horror movies that don't make much sense and don't make any attempt to explain the story and just throw random things at you that you are supposed to think are scary. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie, it just adds a layer of mystery to the air when you are watching it. I thought this movie was really funny, and not scary at all. It had some good jokes, and things that weren't supposed to be funny, like when the bad guy talks, cracked me up. Here's my favorite line, "You play a good game boy, but the game is finished, now you die!". At least it had a cliffhanger ending, those are always cool.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 : This movie was the follow up sequel to one of my favorite horror films, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Although the first one was based on a true story, this one was just complete bullshit. I think this was a good thing because they were able to go crazy with the story and characters and have things happen that would never happen in real life. The whole movie was action packed, it never slowed down really, which is a very good thing. The outrageous characters and dialogue in this movie were freaking hilarious, some of the scenes had me in tears because they said and did some of the craziest things I've ever witnessed. I think this was the best of the bunch that we rented and I highly reccomend it to anyone who can take some gore, because if you are anything like me, this movie will crack you up, excite you, and most importantly, entertain you. My favorite line, "Lick my plate, dog dick!"   Ed Gein : This was supposed to be a real life story about a serial killer from the 50s that pioneered the term "serial killer". The same reasons that made it sound cool, were it's downfall. This guy wasn't cool because he was so old he was practically harmless. He only killed two people in the whole movie, and it wasn't even gory compared to the other movies we watched. He was basically obsessed with his mom, and he misinterpreted the bible into killing people, saw his mom when she was dead, ya know, the usual. Nothing great happened in this movie except for this one part. The killer came out of his house dressed up in this womans skin(boobs and all), and danced around outside in a crazy manner, then walked back into his house. It may not sound like it, but it was extremely funny.  Dawn of the Dead : This was your basic zombie movie, a shitload of zombies are roaming the earth( Supposedly hell was full or something) and a group of people try to survive the onslaught. Don't worry, this movie had a plethora of gratuitous violence. Complete with decapitations, shotgun blasts to the face, zombie beatdowns, zombie attacks portraying flesh mutilation while the camera is close up on the action, and even a bunch of pies to the face of zombie put there by an army of bikers. If this doesn't sound cool, I don't know what does. Did I mention that most of the movie takes place in a fully destructable shopping mall. If any of this sounds good to you, then rent this movie.  The Unnamable : This movie's title suits it well, I shouldn't even be naming this movie as I talk about the rest of them. This movie was horrible, it sucked a fat schlong. I don't even want to talk about why it sucked so bad, it would bring up bad memories, I want my hour and a half back! Well it was pretty funny at the end when they showed the creature, because it was so stupid it was funny. It just made these really crazy/loud hissing noises, and thats all it did, I swear. It was so funny though, me and Zac were laughing during the whole end sequence because of it.  Jackie Brown : I wouldn't know about this one, I didn't really watch it. I left about half way through because Jesseca called, I wasn't digging it too much anyways. If you ask me it sucked, but you would be better off asking Chris or Zac about this one, since they actually watched it. They thought it was pretty good I think. So I dunno.  40 Days and 40 Nights : Finally, the last one. My thoughts on it are these. It was poorly written, it sounded like 40 something guys trying to write hip/cool dialogue for todays youth and it came out awful. There wasn't enough nudity, even though there was a little nudity it wasn't very much for a movie based around sex. The story was good but it was executed wrongly, it could have been so much better, but they screwed it up in their mindless approach. The ending was really bad. I wont spoil anything but I'll tell you it sucks. Just like the old lady in Ed Gein sucks the chrome off of the trailer hitch.  Wow, that last paragraph was incredibly boring!!! I didn't mean to make it that way, I am just too tired and too lazy to write with some sort of style and my full skill. So you get the watered down version. You know what, I was totally gonna write about my weekend right here, but I decided against it. I figure it would not only make this the longest journal ever, but also the most boring ever. It wouldn't be so boring if I felt like sitting here for 6 hours making it cool, but I am not gonna do that, not right now at least. So go fuck a duck. Notice I don't blank out cus words anymore, it's much easier for me that way. So if anyone doesn't like me cussing on here you can sue me.... Jesseca is awesomeeeee!!!

      I was planning on doing a journal tonight, but now it's too late...However, look forward to tommorow. That's when I will detail my weekend and my day (Monday). So it should be very, very lengthy. Goodnighter, your momma's ass couldn't be whiter.

      What am I doing??? I'm supposed to be going to the movies like right now, to see JACKASS: THE MOVIE!!! Hell yea! It is gonna be the funniest movie ever, I have a feeling I am gonna piss my pants from laughing too hard. If that happens I already have a backup plan: I'll cup my hand and catch all of it, then throw it all over everyone in the theater! Hahaha! Actually that's kind of sick huh... So why am I writing in my journal? I dunno. Well as you can see I can't talk right now. Later. (No really, I can't talk. Somebody gagged me and threw me on the floor, I'm typing with my toes.)

      Okay, today was a good day. I didn't even have to use my AK...I'm probably understating my hapiness right now, but I think that's a good thing, I don't want to jinx myself. I have a lot of different things to talk about, so pardon me if I switch subjects too fast. I wouldn't even be writing this if Jesseca didn't request it. I would much rather be getting to bed, because I am T-I-R-E-D. So never let anyone tell you I'm not a nice guy.  I was trying to think of one of the craziest stories I've ever heard so I could talk about it (there's tons of them), and here's what I came up with. Once upon a time, way back in elementary school, (or maybe middle school, who knows)my friend Tommy was arguing with this kid he didn't like about something. I'm not sure what it was about, probably friggin Mortal Kombat or Power Rangers, judging by the time period. So he gets all mad, and the kid wants to fight him. Instead of pushing the kid or instigating a fight like a normal person, he takes his spork (yes I said spork) and repeatedly stabs him in the hand. Of all places, he stabs him in the hand, with a spork, lol. Bad story huh? Yeaaaa I think so too, but not to worry. I have another, and it goes a little something like this: On the day I was born all the nurses gathered around, and they gazed in wide wonder in the joy they had found. The lead nurse spoke up, she said leave this one alone. She could tell right away, that I was bad to the bone. Bet you can't guess what that's from...  Every time you turn on the news you see or hear something about "the sniper", f**k the sniper. I'm sick and tired of hearing about this damn sniper. I've decided that this guy is a f**king pussy. Actually, all snipers are pussies. They stay in a hidden spot and shoot people from about 200 yards away. Now tell me that isn't acting like a little girl. If he wants to kill people that did nothing at all to him he should at least walk up to them and to shoot them where they can see it. Or act like a real killer and use a knife. This "sniper" is the biggest wussy I've ever heard of. The F.B.I. needs to stop playing around with this guy and start threatening him, insulting him, calling him a pussy, and challenging him to come out and do something for a change. My mom said they were gonna try using satellites to catch him and I'll tell you right now, that's not gonna work. I'm aware that challenging him will cause him to kill more people, but eventually he'll just kill the same amount anyway, at the rate they're going. They sure as hell aren't getting anywhere right now. I say they issue a open challenge to this b*tch, and call him names. That way his emotions might get involved, making him much more vulnerable to making a mistake. Lastly, I hear he's starting to communicate with the authorities. Personally, if I got a chance to talk to him, I'd tell him to bring it on.  School... can't live with it, can't live without it. I got my report card today, as I'm sure almost everyone else did. I did pretty good on it, better than I thought actually. That's because I really had a D in computers, but since my teacher likes me and knows I'm smarter than that she raised it up to a B at the last minute. Thanks Mrs. Borden. I got A's in history and physics. Pretty good so far... and then there's Mrs. Kelley. That stupid overweight dike gave me a C, and I had a 78.6 in there. I kind of deserved it, but she doesn't have to be a b*tch about it. She told Zac that there was no hope for me, what a crazy thing to say. I don't think she's aware that I am one of the smartest kids in her class, and that I purposely didn't do any work/didn't pay attention on many occasions just to spite her. I f*king hate that whore. She plays around way too much, pays attention to 3 or 4 kids out of the 35, is unorganized, unforgiving, dumb, ignorant in so many ways about other countries and her own goverment, likes stupid movies, is obsessed with pop culture, is dorky, and is biased. That's a lot right there, but the thing that pisses me off most about her is SHE ISN'T FUNNY! She tries so hard to be funny everyday and I am not amused, neither is 90% of the class. She thinks she is so funny, and not once has she made me laugh other than by her appearance being so sad it's funny to me. You know what? Fu*k You Mrs. Kelley! Staying with the topic of school I have something else to complain about. People that try to whisper things to me in class, or try to get me to understand something by any means other than by talking in a normal voice. I don't know if this happens to anybody else, but it happens to me all the time. Some f**ker that's sitting next to me [cough *tadandchasemchmahon* cough] will be like "psst sihdfuiohfnko", the jibberish means some random sh*t in a really low voice, trying to get me to understand what they're saying in a quiet voice so the teacher won't hear them. Or sometimes Tad will write something on his desk really small and at a crazy f**king angle so I have to lean really close to read it, and even so, I don't know what it says. After they do this crap they always laugh or look at me and expect me to laugh or somthing, but everytime I tell them "what the hell are you talking about". So they keep whispering it over and over and I still don't know what they're saying so I'm just like "ha, yea..." Then when I do find out what they said it is usually not funny at all, and I am easily amused. Here's a news flash for you: I DO NOT COMPREHEND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING WHEN YOU TALK WITH YOUR VOICE AT NEGATIVE 5 DECIPALS AND I CANNOT READ WORDS THAT ARE WRITTEN WITH THEIR LETTERS 1 MILLIMETER TALL. SO IF YOU WANT TO SAY A JOKE TO ME FIRST MAKE SURE ITS FUNNY, THEN SAY HEY DAVE, AND SPEAK UP TO TELL THE JOKE, IN ENGLISH. THIS EXLUDES YOU IF YOUR NAME IS CHASE MCMAHON. IN THAT CASE DO NOT TELL ME A JOKE PERIOD, BECAUSE IT IS A PROVEN FACT THAT YOU ARE NEVER FUNNY, EVER, AND I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU. YOU REDFACED TERET SYNDROME BASTARD.  I keep forgetting to ask Jesseca out when we're on the phone, because I don't want to do it on the computer. But I'll do it one of these days, probably tommorow. So don't try and beat me to it anyone. That's right you little surfer midget, now sit down before I get Ben Boatner on you. Besides, I think it's time for you to go watch your favorite movie -  Surf Ninjas .  That's about it for today. Pretty long considering I just thought it up as I went along. Also, the only post on Sundays and Tuesdays trend continues. For those of you keeping track thats 7 in a row, I think. I can't wait to go to my comfy bed, I'm gonna listen to The Starting Line to put me to sleep. I didn't listen to them for about a month and now when I listen to the cd it's like it's brand new again (you should try that sometime). I love it, good band. Later guys. I'll leave you with a great line from The Ataris, always remember this: "Life ain't all that bad, life ain't all that bad, even if Henry Rollins is your dad"

      What's with me and writing journals on Tuesdays and Sundays? If you would notice every recent journal I've written is dated one of these days. There must be some mysterious mental pattern in my mind that makes me do this, or not. I'll just chalk it up to coincidence... Earlier tonight, at like 12, I ran all the way home from Chris's house and "OHHHHHHH WHAAAAAT AAA RUUUUUSSSHHHH" (somebody's got to remember that from the old days of wrasslin). If you don't know how far that is, it's pretty far, about 2-3 miles. Now I said ran, not walked or jogged. That's a good run. Especially when I was going down Old King's Road, it seemed like it went on forever. That road is all dark and "scary" too, but I wasn't scared because I had a golf ball that I was ready to throw through somebody's head if they surprised me. At the end of the street there was a big blocked off construction site. There were barriers and signs saying not to go in, but those only apply to cars, I think. If not then oh well because I went through there anyway. It was a good thing I didn't fall into a gigantic hole or something. When I passed by Justin's house I decided to go up to his window and see what he was doing. I didn't knock or anything but I saw him and he was wiggin out, haha, crazy Justin. You're probably wondering why the hell I ran home from Chris's, well here's your reason. We just got back from ridin around in Louie's car all night. We went to Chris's and I didn't want to stay the night there, for various reasons. Mostly because Louie was pissing me off and being annoying. So I went in, got a drink of Powerade, told em "that'll cost ya extry" and walked out the door. As for the question of why I ran home instead of walking, I did it for the challenge and the exercise.   I can't remember anything else worth mentioning that happened today, it was just the usual sh*ts n giggles, nothing out of the ordinary. So I'll talk about the events of Friday night. Homecoming was on Friday and yes I went to it, it was alright. Get this, the name of the dance was "Night of Fire: Dance to That Salsa Beat", if that's not the craziest homecoming name you've ever heard I don't know what is. How should I explain the night... umm, I'll start from the beginning. At 7 Chris and I were all dressed up and ready to go. My tie wasn't on though because apparently nobody around here knows how to put on a tie, except for my dad, and he wasn't home. Being dressed up was cool as hell for me because I never get dressed up, Chris thought it was cool as well. I wore black dress pants/shoes, a white shirt, and a tie. Chris, however, went all out. He was wearing a big shiny purple suit with a golden pimp cain and a orange top hat, not to mention his slick willy size 23 turd green shoes. That Chris is quite the character. Alright Alright, I'm just kidding... After my dad got home and tied my tie we went to Lauren's. Her mom said we "cleaned up really nice" and her dad got some footage of me, Chris, and the girls (Lauren, Whitney and Jaclyn) with their video camera. The girls all looked very pretty in their dresses, your welcome Lauren, Whitney and Jaclyn. After a little bit we ate dinner, which was good. Consisting of steak, a potatoe, apple pie, and salad. Then we left for the dance. I didn't buy a ticket at school so I was a little worried that they wouldn't be selling them at the door and not let me in. My worries didn't last long, it was easy as can be to get my ticket. Soon I found out you couldn't come back in if you left, I was like "that sucks" and dismissed it, I wasn't planning on leaving anytime soon. When we first went into the room where the dance was I was thinkin "What the hell this is really gay. This is what homecoming's like, what the heck". Chris said he was thinking the same thing. We probably just thought that because we got there early and there wasn't very many people there yet. Later on we had fun though. Let me clear this up real quick: even though technically me and Whitney were there together, we didn't hang out much at all. Maybe because she was hanging with Jaclyn... I dunno but I would have danced with her if I saw her dancing, but I don't think she did much of that. There was a few things that were cool about this homecoming. One, my dawg John told me I had the best looking tie in the whole place, and that nobody knew how to pick out ties like me. I was like "thanks man, your tie is nice too" but he wasn't wearing a tie. Second, I saw all kinds of kooks I know and talked to em, ya know how that goes. This crazy girl I know took a picture of me when I wasn't expecting it and the flash blinded me for several minutes, it was funny. Third, I danced with some random girl for a little while, so that was pretty fun. I was standing there semi-dancing with Chris and Lauren and a girl was like "hey my friend thinks you're hot, she wants to dance with you", so I was like "alright". There was like four girls wiggin out around me, I suppose they were her friends, but ya never know. Near the end of the dance people were tearing balloons off of the tables and inhaling the helium. In case you are the ultimate dumbass, breathing in helium makes your voice extremely high and crazy, and funny as freak. Brittany was crackin me up doing that and she tried to show me how to do it and I couldn't. I was just being a goon, because I've done it before. Oh man, then Scott Spinelli came up with his voice crazy style and said "dude, you just majorly f**ked up!". Me, Chris, Lauren, and Brittany burst into laughter. The crazy sound of his voice coupled with the "what the f**k" factor of what he said made it freaking extremely funny. It was even funnier because at school we always laugh hysterically at him every time he walks by just because he looks crazy. Oh man, I don't know about anybody else, but I had a good time.  On the way out they wouldn't let us leave without taking a sombrero with us, so we were like "sweet, free somberos baby". We didn't have a ride home, so we started walking down A1A (we didn't leave with Lauren, Whitney, and Jaclyn by the way). We didn't fit in with the crowd at all. There were scruffy looking bikers and bikes galore, because of biketoberfest. Then there was us, walking down A1A all dressed up in suits and ties, with sombreros in our hands. It was cool though because we got everybody's attention, they couldn't help looking at us. Some drunk guy walked by us and asked us if we were selling bibles so we wigged out on him. I don't remember what we said to him exactly but it was something like "I'll cut off your balls and sell em on the black market fag". What came next was the complete opposite of what happened before. Some chick in a car yelled at us (ya know like "whooo yeaaa!"). Then she was like "let me have your sombero!" so I was like "alright". They stopped, I caught up to their car, and she got out. I gave my sombrero to her and Chris gave his to some other chick in the car. They were both pretty hot. When I gave her it she was like "you're cute, you can have a hug" and we hugged, but it was one of those sideways hugs and I was expecting a regular one. So my arm was too high up and I just totally grabbed her boob. She either didn't notice or didn't care, because she didn't say anything. After I did it I saw that there were guys in the car, and I was surprised they didn't say anything to me. They were probably scurred, because they drove off without even looking at me funny. 5 seconds later we're walking down the street again and I'm like "dude, I accidentally grabbed that girls boob" and I explained. Chris was like "oh yeaah". Then it hit me. I touched that girls boob. I was like "I just touched that girls boob! That was awesome". We talked about that for awhile before giving up on the whole walking home thing and calling Chris's mom to tell her to come pick us up. And thus, this brought our night to an end, my friend.  I remembered something else that we did earlier tonight. We went to Louie's cousin's house in New Symrna. There were a bunch of peeps there, but it wasn't a party, according to them that was just their group. In any case, we got to meet his aunt and cousin, so it was cool. There was a lone black guy hanging out with them, so we figured out it is awesome to have a black kid as your friend and we determined that we need to get one for our gang. That's all that happened so far this weekend folks. But there's always today, Sunday, to make something else happen. On Sundays I usually lay around and do nothing all day, but thats what I did on Saturday, so I'll probably do something today. I do know I'm gonna talk to Jesseca, and that is always fun :)  Ya know, at first I didn't think this flame design looked so hot (cheesy pun fully intended), but I'm liking it more and more everyday. I think it's great, I bet everyone else thinks it looks gay. Who the hell cares though, it's 5 o' clock in the morning and I'm sittin here talking about some flames. I'm tired as a mofo, and now it's so early that I'm getting hungry so I'm gonna have to eat something now. I better get to sleep so I can wake up for that nooner.

      What is going on again? Oh yeah, it's Tuesday...how exciting. Today when I woke up I told my mom I wasn't going to school because we were taking the PSAT test. I explained in detail why I shouldn't go and told her that the test was useless and a waste of time. After all this she's like "what? why are you telling me this now? you should've told me last night, you're going to school" and I'm like "no i'm not" and shes like "yes you are". So I go in my room and sit around forever. Then when she urges me to get ready I just move all slow and do stupid stuff to make it take longer. Finally she says "are you ready?" and I'm like "yea sure I'm ready motherfu*ker, but i'm just gonna scribble all over that fu*kin test and go to sleep". She didn't say anything to me all the way to school, probably because I had a pissed off look on my face. I get to school like 30 minutes late and i'm like "i'm really late" and she's like "it's better than not coming to school at all" and I just said "no it's not" and got out of the car. At first I didn't even know where to go, then some lady was telling kids to go to their homeroom. So I go there and everyones already taking the test. When I walked in the guy was like "why are you late?" and I'm thinkin what the hell kind of question is that...I just gave him some crazy answer, I forget what I said. Something along the lines of "only the good die young". Then I christmas tree'd the test and went to sleep. As you can tell, I didn't want to be at school, and I was severely pissed off.  Later on I was alright though, because it's hard to stay mad forever, especially with all kinds of funny stuff goin on. We didn't do much else all day except talk with our friends and stuff. History was cool though because we had an assignment to draw a political satire, and as you know, I love the political satires. That reminds me, yesterday during first block Tad was fu*kin crackin me up. I'm not sure why I thought it was so funny, but I was laughing  a lot . I was laughing so hard I was getting the chills in my feet (yes, in my feet), don't ask me why. Anyways, whenever he dragged his foot across the ground it made a loud ass squeaking noise. He was like "check this out" and repeatedly dragged his foot across the ground, everyone was looking around for the person who did it, but he just kept doing it. Everytime I heard the noise I started laughing hysterically/ crying, basically fu*kin wiggin out, and he did it like a million times, so you can imagine how much I was laughing. I think it was funny because our teacher kept talking like nothing was going on even though there was this crazy noise filling the room every 2 seconds. lol i'm laughing right now just thinking about it. He did this like the whole period, even when people told him to stop, it was the funniest thing ever. I was laughing for almost 90 minutes straight, I can't believe the teacher didn't say anything to me, I was crying all over the place and stuff. Then I wigged out even more because Tad kept touching the kid in front of me on the shoulder and face, making it look like I did it, and I couldn't defend myself because I couldn't talk because I was laughing too hard. It looked like I did it and that made me laugh harder. Oh man, that sh*t was hilarious.  Then I came home and watched the news. Which brings me to my next subject: the "sniper" that's been in the news lately. First I have to say that I prophetically predicted this about 2 weeks ago, well sort of. I was talking about how weird it was that we haven't had any serial killers lately, and how we were due for one, pretty weird huh. Chris and I have talked about being able to get away with crimes easily if you're smart like us, (after all, we do it all the time)and this guy is a perfect example. He does exactly what we talked about a long time ago. He kills random people, in random cities, far apart from eachother. He even added the whole shoot them from far away thing, whereas me and Chris just said drive by shoot them. He's already killed 9 people and wounded 2 others without getting caught, and there's like 400 FBI agents on the case, not to mention local and state authorities and every citizen in Maryland and Virginia looking for him. If I were him I would be saying "who's the man?", but also if I were him I would quit while I was ahead. Because if he quits now they will never catch him, and it seems to me like he doesn't want to get caught. I am not by any means saying that what he's doing is good, or even cool. Instead, I'm pointing out a problem with law enforcement: it doesn't work very well. All these people can't catch one guy, and we should feel safe with cops protecting us... All cops do nowadays is waste their time trying to bust kids like me for stupid sh*t like curfew (me and my friends have been pulled over for curfew at least 30 times, no exaggeration), when they should be catching real criminals, like sniper boy over here. Oh wait..they're trying to do that, but it's too hard for them. Cops are trash....  Next, some of these people's theories on the "sniper" are fu*kin stupid. For one, I don't even think he should be called a sniper, that's more of a war term. They should call him a shooter or murderer but not sniper. Second, this guy is NOT a terrorist! These news assholes call everyone that does something bad a terrorist lately. So there is a guy shooting people, people get shot all the time, it isn't terrorism! Third, i've been hearing about people blaming all this crap on video games on the internet, but today I actually saw a guy say it on tv. Now that is the biggest bullsh*t I have ever heard. Some fat dude thinks it is a group of teenagers working together, and he thinks they trained using Doom. He says it's all a "game" to them, it's all just one big "game". I would like to rip his head off and use it for a ball in a "game" of basketball. Shut your mouth fatass, it's not a group of teenagers and you can't train to shoot a gun using video games, so go eat a cheeseburger. This guy acts like there was no serial killers before video games came out, what the hell. I don't know where he got the whole Doom thing either, that game is like 10 years old, and it doesn't involve anything remotely similar to sniping. Unless he's referring to the brand new Doom 3. In that case hes way off again because there are only aliens, monsters, and even the devil himself in that game, but no humans. So how would somebody train to snipe people in that... Now I'm saying it isn't a terrorist and it isn't teenagers, then who is it? I would say it's just some crazy guy, just like any serial killers of the past. I bet he's white, aged 25-35, and either pissed off at the world or crazy. I called it, you can tell me how smart I am when he fits that description. Or you can always make fun of me if i'm wrong and one of those fagets are right. Then there's always the possibility that they don't catch him...  It's all good in the sports world, Barry Bonds and the Giants are goin to the World Series. The 49ers, my long time favorite football team (check out my room if you don't believe me), gave the Seahawks the beatdown and are now 4-1. Owens mossed all over that kook, scored a touchdown, pulled a pen out of his sock, and signed the ball. If you saw that game you know what I'm talkin about. How about that Miami vs Denver game sunday night, that was an awesome game, one of the best i've ever seen. It was pretty cool to see the sucessors to Dan Marino and John Elway face off, and it was a close one too. Did you know Kurt Warner has the best QB rating ever? thats crazy...but then comes Steve Young, Joe Montana, and Jeff Garcia. All three played/play for the 49ers, so that makes up for it.  Wow, scroll through quickly and look at what you just read, that was a pretty long journal huh. I think so. Definitely the longest I've written, nobody but my most diehard fans will sit through this whole thing, especially since it's about things that most people don't care about. So if you did read this whole thing, you deserve a dollar. That doesn't mean i'll give you a dollar, but if you're a girl you can have a hug :). I should probably go to sleep, because it's already late. But I usually don't go to sleep until like 1-2 am because I take a nap when I get home from school and I'm not tired at night. I'm gonna try to stop this crazy schedule one of these days (not tonight though), because I don't like waking up and it being all dark. I get confused, plus I waste most of the day. ANYWAYS, I think thats quite enough for one day. Goodnight girls.

      S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y NIGHT...S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y NIGHT.... You know how it goes... If you don't know that song then you are a kook. And if you didn't know that Brent is "The White Supremisist", then you do now...(and yes I know it says it's sunday, but in reality, its late saturday night/ early sunday morning) Ummm the octoberfest was tonight, and I didn't have as much fun as I should have. Everyone I talk to about it said they had a lot of fun, but not me. I mean, it was alright, but it wasn't  that  cool. Maybe it was because I only rode one ride (the crazy dance baby!), and even though we talked to a bunch of girls we weren't really hanging out with any of them, and I think girls are necessary for me to enjoy myself. I don't like hanging out with a group of guys all night, I think that was my problem. The other thing that pissed me off though was we were waiting in line for The Motherf**ker (the craziest ride ever) for a long time, and when we were about to get on the guy that was running it just walked away and never came back. Apparently they were closing the whole place down because it was 11, but the guy could have told us that, instead he just walks away like an a$$hole. Everyone was yelling stuff at him afterwards though, so it was cool. There were a few good things about tonight though. For one, Zac and Chris were on drugs and it was funny to watch them wig out. Two, I stepped on some old lady's foot and she was like "OOH!". I was cracking up about that for at least an hour. Third, Brent was being funny as hell. First we asked him what he was on and he said "EVERYTHING". Then he repeatedly claimed to be "the white supremisist", and he got me sayin white supremisist all night. Last but not least, I came home with more tickets then I left with, which was awesome. I was given tickets by not one, not two, but three[!] girls. I am one bada$$ pimp if I do say so myself (j/k). It was funny one of the times though because I went up to these girls to ask em to ride The Motherfu*ker with us and they were like "do you want our tickets?" and I was like "do you wanna go on the motherf**ker?" and they were like "what?" and I was like "haha nevermind I'll take em". Aww man that was pretty crazy, I guess I had a good time tonight...On the way home this kid wanted to fight us or somthing and we just kept saying crazy stuff to him and he got all mad, but he didn't do anything. There were four of us and one of him, so he woulda got the beatdown anyways. That was funny though.  Some other stuff that happened this weekend...on Friday me and chris went fishing at the park, we caught two fish and 2 frogs. It doesn't sound very exciting, but it's what we did with them that counts. We put the fish in the back of the toilets (you know the part with the top that comes off), one fish in the men's and one in the women's. Then we flushed the big frog down the toilet, he never came back up. The fish got stuck in this little hole when we flushed it too, it was crazy. After that we were left with the little frog, it was actually more toadish, but ya know, we just threw it all far. Me and Chris go fishing like once a year and we never seem to learn that fishing is f*c*ing gay. It takes forever just to catch one fish, its extremely boring. It especially sucks when you're trying to catch brim, at central park, with bread. Because they always just nibble off your bread without actually getting hooked. I swear they do this about 1000 times before you catch one of em. So this time I need to remember for sure, never go fishing again.  You know what bothers me everytime I write in this journal? I can never honestly say what I want, it always gets censored or cut down (by me). I mean, if this was a journal that only I read it would have way more. Sometimes I omit things because I don't want people to think I'm crazy, or violent, or this or that. But usually that's not why I take stuff out. Usually I delete things to be nice to one individual person, and if it werent for that person, you would be seeing lots of stuff that you dont see. I'm not talking about anyone in particular either, its case specific. What i'm saying is, I have no problem sharing my thoughts and feelings with everyone. It's just sometimes I dont want to be rude, or alienate somebody and make them feel like I'm not their friend because of something I wrote about them. Whenever I write something really gutsy I get online all late that night or early in the morning and edit it out before anyone reads it. So now at least you know that, so you can try and catch the unedited versions of my journal if you want. All of the stuff I edit out isn't even gutsy, sometimes I just think what I wrote was gay/ stupid and get rid of it. So you can laugh at me for making stupid remarks if you read it. I brought this up because this whole paragraph was about something else, but I deleted it for the aforementioned reasons.  I haven't talked to Jesseca in like 4 days :( , that sucks dudes, I miss her. It really sucks because she just got done being grounded for a month and I haven't seen her. I've been doin stuff like all weekend, so I'm not sure if she's called or anything. I was kinda hoping I would see her at the octoberfest, but nope. I saw Amber and I was gonna ask her where the Jessmyster was but I reacted too slow and I couldn't find her. I'm gonna call her tommorow though, I'll ask her if she wants to go to the fest. That'll be cool because I have all these extra tickets and stuff... I'm in the mood to chill out to some Dashboard Confessional, so I'm gonna go, and go to sleep. LaTeR bUdDiEs!  p.s. HI JESSECA!

      Dahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!  I hope everyone is doing better than me, because if not than the world as a whole is one pissed off sonofab**ch. (haha chris) An obscene amount of trash overwhelmes me right now. I'm feeling very frustrated and pissed off. I should probably explain before I wig out. From the beginning, here's what happened. I sign on in World Chess Network (some online chess thing where you can play people from around the world), the first thing it tells me is that my trial membership ends today, great. That wasn't really a big deal to me because I'm not a chess club kook or anything, no really i'm not. I was doing pretty good up until that point, my rating was pretty high. I even won a couple games when I first started, making me like 6-1 overall. Then I got cocky and challenged some guy that was way better then me, he whooped me. So I challenge some guy who had a way worse rating than me (I emphasize, way worse), and I didn't really pay attention and underestimated him. So he beat me with some crazy maneuver, and he won really fast. I just laughed at this because it was pretty funny, he even said it was pure luck. So then I challenge some kook who is about even with me skill wise. I start off really good, and i'm talking mad trash the whole time, because I think the guy's a moron or somthing because it seemed like I was dominating him. I continued dominating him up until the last 30 seconds. (there is a 20 minute time limit) All the guy had was his queen and his king, and I guess that's all it takes, because he took out every single f**k*ng guy I had, there had to be about 11 of them. One by f*ck*ng one. It was seriously the gayest trash of all time. He checkmated me when there was 5 seconds left until he lost by time. Damn that sucked, and it wasn't so bad that I lost, it's that I talked extreme trash and called him a loser, biotch, insulted him, and told him he was gonna lose repeatedly. He showed me, he even called me weak, even though that might not sound so bad, it pissed me off. But I did learn a couple things from this experience: never talk trash during chess, never challenge people unless they suck really bad, and if you beat me at chess then you are a piece of sh*t a$$hole that has no life. Chess is gay anyways...  Now thats not even what I'm mad about, because I'm not even very good at chess. The thing that really made me mad was Mega Man 5, because if I'm losing at some craziness like chess I don't really care. However, if i'm losing at a video game, then i'm gonna be mad because I pride myself at being the master of video games. The game has been pretty hard, and it has given me a harder time than the other preceding Mega Mans, but difficulty I can deal with. In fact, I like games to be a challenge. The thing I cannot deal with is bad design/ programming, commonly seen in crappier games than the Mega Man series. The part I keep dying at isn't hard, it's bad level design, pure and simple. The level is perfect up until this glaring flaw, it is stupid and near impossible to pass. I will spare you the details because it would be crazy to explain this crap in depth. I'm surprised nobody else has mentioned it, it messes up the whole game. I tried it like 15 times and it won't work. If it wasn't a ROM and I had the actual game I would have already thrown the cartridge way the hell down my street, chased it down and slammed it on the ground again, gotten my sledgehammer, and smashed it into a million pieces, and then peed on it. I swear. I am seriously considering throwing this controller through my monitor and destroying my whole computer and/or smashing my Mega Man X cartidge and flushing it down the toilet for consolation. I'm not sure what I'm gonna do right now. I think i'll do what I always do when this happens, play it some other time when i'm happier. Because right now I have the determination, but I just don't think I can do much to help the situation when I'm so pissed off.  Now that I have calmed down and thought about it, I have realized that I am really drowsy, tired, hot, and sweaty...and I have a splitting headache. I apologize for writing about this before I noticed I was just in some crazy mood and wiggin out. I know that this entry was poorly written and had the most uninteresting, dorky subject matter of all time. Even so, I'm going to leave it on here (i could delete it you know) just for a laugh. It will also give you a glimpse of how trashy I can be when I'm angry, and how funny it is. I'm gonna take a shower and go to bed, even though its early.(Yes, 10:00 is early for me) Later.

      Wow, what a crazy weekend... I spent it hanging out with Chris and Mike, and briefly, Louie. Good times. We were laughing like 75% of the time. Probably because we were tired and crazy the whole weekend. In any case, I haven't had some good laughs like that in a while. I was gonna describe the events in depth and in chronological order, but I think sometimes things are better left unsaid. Actually thats bullsh*t, I'm just too lazy to take the time and write all of it (They don't pay me enough). Besides, even though it's funny stuff,  I don't think anyone wants to sit here forever reading 6 pages about me and my off the wall antics. But if you do, ummm... do... something... else....lol. I hate making a post this small, but I think I'll more than make up for it as soon as I'm not so busy with other stuff. It's not a lack of things to say, it's a lack of will to write it all down. One of these days I'm gonna make the biggest journal entry in the history of the world, so don't fret. I've got one more thing to say before I go: I Love Jesseca.

      It's Tuesday, baby, oh yes...(heavy emphasis on sarcasm there). Not much goin on today, and school was so average that nothing even remotely interesting or worth mention happened. Maybe this is the proverbial calm before the storm. The storm being the Dashboard Confessional concert on Thursday night and the long awaited pep rally the following Friday morning. It seems to me like October is a month jam-packed with fun and excitement, for me anyways. With events such as pep rallies, a free day on the 11th, a Dashboard Confessional concert, a Gwar concert (Gwar rocks!!!), the Octoberfest, Halloween Horror Nights, and of course, Halloween itself. Not convinced that October is the coolest month around? Well then you must be gay.  I went to the doctor today, they took my blood! Those bastards. As if that weren't enough, they forced me to pee in a cup.(Come on guys, one or the other) Will someone please tell me who thought of making people pee in a little cup in order to run tests on them. For that matter who the hell thought of draining people's blood out of their body. (That stuff doesnt grow back you know, they take your blood and its gone for good) Sounds like some fuc*in vampires or somthin....On second thought, who gives a damn about the guy who invented this crazy sh*t. But hey, if you're reading this, do me a favor and go study some more pee, fag. Now that I got that out, I can tell you about my first blood (kinda like Rambo hehe) experience. First of all, I was completely unaware of the fact that I had to get my blood taken. I thought I was just gonna have to pee in my little cup, and get out of there. Simple enough right? But no, I walk in there and the nurse is like "sit down" and i'm like "alright" but I'm still not for sure whats going on. Then she wraps a armband thing tightly around my bicep like i'm some sort of heroine addict or something, and at this point I realize what she's about to do. So naturally, I start laughing. Because as a very smart man once said "Against the barrage of laughter, nothing can withstand", if you think about it it's true, it's a cool saying, and one of my mottos (the other being "Don't stop, get it get it!"). Anyways, the nurse tells me to squeeze this apple thingy she put in my hand, when I did this my vein got really big and visible, and i'm thinkin "oh god".  Man let me tell ya, if you have never had your blood taken, it is crazy. They stick a needle right in that big a$$ vein by your elbow and blood just flows into the container. They don't just put it in there for a couple seconds either, it's more like a minute, and for me, they filled up two containers. The whole time it's going on I was in a state of delirium, half due to the lightheadedness that comes from blood loss, and half being derived from my thoughts of "ahh its not over, geez this is taking forever, whats going on this crazy b**ch is f**kin sucking my blood". Seemingly for extra affect, my nurse was black. So she was all like "put cho arm right chere sucka, squeeze dis fool, hold still while I steal essential parts of your anatomy from you". I'm just kidding, she was pretty cool. Besides the fact that she is a blood and urine thief. How could someone do that for a living anyways??  When we left the doctors office, my dad and I went to the car repair palace to pick up the van. There were lots of stereotypical grease monkeys abound, and plenty of technical car talk for weeks. After the guy gave my dad a full report on the car it was time to take it home. And since it was just me and my dad, I was forced to drive it home. What a bummer... Although technically this was illegal, since I only have my permit (only 10 more months to the day I get my license!!!), who's gonna stop me? So that was pretty fun, it was the first time I've driven a car without my parents in the passenger side. It was rather easy too, not that it would be hard, i'm just sayin. Wow, that's 2 firsts in one day, not bad huh? Not bad at all.

      Hey Jesseca, this is for you:  Looking into your eyes I see all I want to be, I don't want it to end.  If I could only put three words away, I see you.  I only know I have an angel with me now.  And when I fall asleep you're all that I see. You're in my thoughts and all of my prayers. I wish I could be all that you mean to me. My angel without wings, my angel.  I wish you could see all that you mean to me, because I could never find the words to tell you.  And when I fall asleep you're all that I see. You're in my thoughts and all of my prayers. I wish I could be all that you mean to me.  My angel without wings                                      -Fenix TX (I changed a couple lyrics, as I always do when something doesn't make sense or I don't like it)  You should download the song Fenix TX- Your my angel, it will make that sound a whole lot better. Anyways, I'm leavin to go to my aunt Wendy's house in South Carolina in the morning. My entire family is gonna be there pretty much so it should be total madness, like 30 people sleeping in one house, and the house isn't even that big. It's gonna be really fun though, or else I wouldn't be going. So I hope you have an awesome Thanksgiving, I'll be thinking about you, and I'll be back Saturday so it's not even that long. And most importantly, I love you!

      Nevermind the date above, today is Wednesday. Some may even call it Hump Day. I know what you may be thinking, why the hell would anyone call it hump day? Well that can mean one of two things. One, if you're a pervert, it's the day that you normally hump some random stranger on the streets. The second and more suitable meaning is this: it's the day in the middle of the week where it's no longer the beginning, and you get over that hump and start counting down the days until the weekend. Pretty spiffy huh, I heard that from the all knowing Mr. Monaghan (my wonderful physics/ chemistry teacher). School was fun today. I learned about the periodic table of elements. Even though I've learned about it before, I didn't completely understand until now. It is actually put together rather brilliantly if you ask me... The Marines were in my second block class, so that was interesting. The Marines seem badass to me. A few things I picked up on while they were talking and during the video they showed us. They are the only branch of the military to guard the president, there aren't that many of them, they carry a friggin sword (how cool is that), they wig out at boot camp(I heard them yelling "kill!" at every command), you must have a tan belt in judo to start out as a Marine, they even did some marching drills in class and it was all synchronized even though the two particular Marines had never trained or practiced together, and most of all, their songs are the most catchy marching/ military songs i've ever heard, they rock, and so do the Marines as a whole. The recruiter was cocky as hell too, which I liked. He was like "I am confident about talking in front of the class for two reasons. One, I'm a Marine. Two, I'm a sniper" then he laughed. He also had a fat ass gold watch on, and he told us about his 3 cars and 2 motorcycles to make sure we knew he was livin large...Speaking of cars, Zac got a new car and he's talking about it nonstop. I can understand that he's excited about it, but come on. Hehe, I say this now, but whenever I get my car i'll probably be talking about it as much as him, probably more. But until then you can't call me a hypocrite. And everyone who talks about their system that they're gonna have(ya know, the one with the big 12's, 15's, 1000 watt amps galore, mids and highs, the works), save it until you have actually purchased everything and it's all installed in your car, ready to play. Then you can brag about it all you want, I won't mind(Hell, I'll even brag with you). Otherwise you just end up lying about a bunch of stuff, changing your mind every couple days, and sounding like an idiot.  I think that's enough ranting for now, let me instead enlighten you with my wisdom. In case you didn't already know, sleeping is the cure for all. If I am ever in a bad mood, grumpy, confused, unhappy, indecisive, or any other negative adjective you can think of I can go to sleep and wake up fully refreshed, and happier than Micheal Jackson at a day-care center. This would likely work for other people too, it's just that I know it works for me. I figured it out today, when I took a nap for about 4 hours and awoke in a dancing frenzy. I also discovered that dancing in a hooded sweater or "hoodie" makes me look really thuggish/ cool. You should try it sometime, you won't be dissapointed. Anyways, I danced forever when I woke up, and it was fun.  As you may know, I watched Panic Room last night(I didn't watch the Sum of All Fears because I didn't wanna stay up too late). It was good almost the whole time, providing many cheap thrills and tense moments. There is some gore, but not as much as I imagined after my sister told me a guy gets hit in the head with a sledgehammer. It's not that bad really. The only problem with the movie is the ending, which I don't like at all. What kind of movie builds up a very good anti-hero the whole time, having him save the day at the end, but then doesn't let him get away with the crime? Take Fast and the Furious for example. Vin Diesel is the anti-hero and everyone starts to like him even though he's the bad guy, at the end he drives away(albeit without sucessfully completing the highjacking), but he gets away, and thats the way it should be. Panic Room doesn't do that, and it's supposed to be a happy ending. Well i've got news for ya assholes, everyone wanted the black guy to get away with it, therefore it isn't a happy ending! But my complaints are in vain, so I will stop the wiggage... Oh yea, if anyone cares. Jesseca got kicked off last night and couldn't get back on, it wasn't a protesting measure of any kind...That is all. Now I ride out. Peacer, ya greasers.

      I think some crazy stuff happened at school today and I  know  several crazy things happened this weekend, but that doesn't mean I'm going to talk about them. Why not? Because I don't feel like it right now, I am really tired and groggy, and I guess you could say I'm grumpy. I was supposed to do be doing a bunch of stuff today when I got home, I had it all written down and planned out, but I didn't really accomplish anything... I did download a bunch of music videos though! I got some Taking Back Sunday, Ataris, and The Starting Line videos(and concert footage). It was pretty cool for me because I had never seen any of them perform before, and never saw them at all save for crappy pictures at their websites. My first impressions of The Ataris were what the fuck this guy is fat and dorky and fucking gay. It totally ruined my image of them, they were my favorite band too. It was ok though, the more I watched of them, the more I accepted it and now I like them the same as I used to it just came as a shock at first. Although I will admit that they make the worst music videos I have ever seen in my life, it is so amateur, and the lip syncing is so bad, that it's not even funny. No really, its that bad... My impressions of Taking Back Sunday was "wow they're awesome, they rock" from the beginning. No dissapointment here, it's funny how that works though because they were previously my least favorite of the three. Now they seem so much better to me due to their professional looking video and overall coolness while performing. Last but not least we have The Starting Line. They were like the median between the other two, their video was not as good as Taking Back Sunday, but not as bad as The Ataris. The video would have been way better had it not been for this crazy old guy getting all these chicks, dunking the lead singers face in a toilet, being nude, and acting like a jock. One other thing that bothered me was the lead singer looks like a fucking homo, to the extreme. He doesn't look that bad when he's just talking before the song at this concert video I have, only about an 8 out of 10 on the fag scale. It's when he's singing that he turns into a complete and total faget, that's when his gayness reaches a level that is off the fuckin charts. Hehe, but oh well, The Starting Line still owns you and your momma.  My conversation with Jesseca today consisted solely of one huge argument about some stupid shit that Katelin wrote about love. I disagreed with it, and she thought it was correct. We probably should've agreed to disagree, but instead we sat there and quarreled about that bullshit for like an hour. Near the end I told her to drop it and she said I was just saying that because I was wrong (which I wasn't), I told her I wasn't wrong and that started some more arguing. She said it was 100% correct, and I proved to her without a shadow of a doubt that it was definitely not 100% correct. Then I put one of those smiley faces with their tongue sticking out. Right after that she signed off without saying anything. Whether or not it was in protest, or if she's mad at me, or anything like that, I'm not sure. It sure seemed like it. In any case, that whole argument was a perfect example why I don't like to start arguing with her about anything. If i'm right and I know it I am going to wig out on you hardcore, I don't care who it is, so I usually try to avoid that kind of situation with Jess. Oh well though, in the immortal words of Justin, that's what happens. I don't feel like doing anything else today, so I'm gonna grab some pizza and coke, sit back, relax, and watch a double header of the enormous blockbuster hits: The Sum of All Fears and Panic Room.

      You better set aside some time to read this one, because it's a whopper...John's back! and even though he's only been out for a few days we've already had some good times, times I'll never forget. Don't think John's very exciting? Well he's got enough new jokes(not to mention dances) to entertain an army, well he cracks me up at least. How about these: I, Seven, and personal favorite, You goin to the barbecue? (they say "what barbecue?") My meat in your grill. It's good to have you back John...Veterans Day was today and we had an assembly thingy in the morning with a bunch of teachers/war veterans talked to us. Couldn't hear a word any one of those kooks said. There was some crazy group of juniors behind me and Chris throwing gum into the crowd. They were cracking up because they thought it was the funniest thing, but Chris and I were just laughing at them. I saw a couple funny lookin kids at that thing and laughed,  I got a bunch of free breadsticks at lunch(oh yeaaaa), but for school today those were about the most exciting things that happened. That being said, it's time for me to brag and boast about the Seabreeze  VICTORY  over the Mainland Buc-a-Nerds.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! EVERYONE AT MAINLAND, I LAUGH AT YOU!!!! Everyone said "Mainland's got the best D in the league, Mainland's undefeated, Mainland this, Mainland that". That was all until you played us, now look at Mainland. They're a bunch of LOSERS!! (all of this stuff doesn't apply to a couple people, you know who you are). 52-20 was the score, Mainland has been officially bitchafied. Now who has the best D? It looked like we had the best D the way we were hittin you queers out there, knocking peoples helmets off and sending kids flying back 10 yards. All while big Xavier was throwing 50 yard passes, and Kenny Scott was running the ball straight up your asses(that rhymed :). Mainland only allowed 1 touchdown all season until they played us, then they gave up 7 in one game. Our offense is unstoppable, they just found out first hand. Hey, at least you have a better band(hehe that rhymed too). Mainland was also number 1 in the state before they played us, and we beat them, now we both have 9-1 records. Wouldn't that make us the best in Florida? I would think so, especially considering the decisiveness of our win. It wasn't a narrow 3 point victory, we totally destroyed Mainland, making us the best. We are in my mind at least. At the game Chris and I were wearing Seabreeze shirts and sitting on the Mainland side. A couple of girls stopped me and were like "Yea Seabreeze!" and I was like "Hell yea!...You go to Seabreeze?" and they're like "no, but you've got some guts". I told em "Yep, I got balls the size of coconuts"(they should start callin me Dr. Suess the way I'm layin down all these rhymes) and walked away. Besides a couple groups of fuckers nobody else said anything really, probably because they were too busy crying. We didn't care though, we danced the mightiest dance ever danced. We busted the various John moves, the Justin, the Dave, the lawnmower, the weedwacker, the edger, the crip walk, the harlem shake, you name it. We danced forever, it was a feeling of euphoria rarely felt during football games. A lot of people left early on the Mainland side, they couldn't handle the defeat. But some were being nice, saying "good game" or "you guys played well" as we walked out, I was kind of surprised that so little people tried to pick a fight. Lucky for them though, because John would have ended up killing about 3,000 Mainlandies. He had our back, and nobody messes with John, he can benchpress 325 pounds and curl all the weights in Chris's weight room with ease. I have on thing left to say to Mainland: Who's the bitch now?  Since I'm already speaking of sports, I beat NBA2k2 yesterday(completed season and playoffs), and frankly, I want my 98 hours back. I did finish with the best regular season record ever and went 16-0 in the playoffs, but oftentimes I didn't feel like playing and spent hours just playing it tirelessly to get to the end of the season/ playoffs. Near the end of the road I started gaining enthusiasm, after all I was in the playoffs and had almost won a championship. Whenever I finally finished the game I was expecting a flashy video with celebration, or dunks, or some other craziness. What I got was a stupid one screen deal that said Sacramento Kings: NBA Champions!!! Then the trophy spins up slowly with some crappy sparkle effect in the backround before going back to the menu screen, leaving me horribly dissapointed. I'm like "that's it!!?". That was the most unrewarding game I have ever encountered, I couldn't believe it. I mean, I nearly broke my Dreamcast with some 8-9 hour marathons on that game and this is what I get, well I'm not too happy about it. I will never play through another season on any basketball game for as long as I live. Nonetheless, I have a little song about the game:  You were lost soldier when I hit you with the crossover, take the baseline, stop-pull-up and I makes mine. When I stick you the stakes high. I'm taking the rock, with this pressure I'm making the stadium lock. It's excitin when you're watchin NBA style clash of the titans. The handles is quicker than the eyes like lightnin and when you gettin dunked on it's frightenin, believe that. What chu need that when you came to get your ball on? I got you sweatin your body fluids till they all gone. I got you hurtin when I'm seein you breath, mad at me when I shut you down with the best D in the league. You couldn't score if I gave you a three, wide open. I'll take you straight to the hoop and leave the baseline smokin. I'm pokin, cuz none of yall can get with me. On a solo fast break I might bust a 360, move quickly. Sweat is better than fame, you might catch me at the three point testin my aim. I'm yellin And 1! every time I step in the lane, that's why Sega's always bringin you the best in the game.  In other news, 8 Mile is getting rave reviews. Well at least from my sister, her fiance, my aunt, and my cousin. They all said it was awesome. I was going to see it last weekend, but I never did for one reason or another. It looks like I won't be seeing it this upcoming weekend either because Harry Potter 2 comes out, and that I have to see. Yes, you heard me right, Harry Potter rocks! (I've read all the books and the second is tied with 4 for my favorite) Staying with the subject...I flicked myself in the nuts this weekend and It reminded me just how bad it hurts to get hit in the balls. It has to be the equivalent, painwise, of pushing out a baby for girls. All of the women who have ever said men have it easier because they don't have to go through the pain of giving birth are forgetting one thing, they have never gotten hit in the goenads, it hurts just as bad, if not worse. Ok, I'll admit that I'm exaggerating quite a bit here, but it still hurts like a motherfucker.  Alan came over yesterday, that was an unexpected visit. We sat there and talked for like 2 hours, and I was in my boxers the whole time, so that was pretty crazy. Oh yeah Alan, I too, like the awkward situations that occur when you go over people's you haven't talked to in a long time... There is a couple more pressing issues that I must tend to. First, I didn't know we had school today. I was under the impression that since it was veteran's day we wouldn't have to go to school. Apparently I was wrong...that sucks, I wanted the day off so bad. The funny thing about it is I was telling people on Friday not to come Monday because we have no school, and I even made plans to do stuff on Sunday night and Monday afternoon/day. LoL, well my plans were spoiled, to say the least. Second, my family and I are supposed to be going to South Carolina to visit my aunt Wendy for the Thanksgiving holiday, and I'm a little stressed out about it. I always get like this before we take any trips, I feel like I'm going to miss out on something big back home, or miss everyone excessively. I'm usually right though, so I have a reason to be worried. I will probably have fun, and I'm probably over-reacting, but I'm just kinda wiggin about going. I don't think I have a choice though, so I might as well not worry about it. I just hope I don't have to hang out with my uncle's redneck son too much. Adults always think just because two kids are the same age they will get along well. Well there are plenty of kids at my school who are my age that I think are total fagets, including rednecks, so this kid better not try to hang with me too much. Especially since I don't like the country type very much in the first place. Lastly, Justin banned us all and denounced us and sort of disowned us as his friends over some stupid shit a while back, but he never really said why. He repeatedly claimed that he "has had enough of our bullshit". We kind of knew that something was up because we were his only friends in the whole world, so there should be a better reason than that, unless he truly went crazy or somthing. Well the truth has finally revealed itself. It turns out that Justin is moving to Pennsylvania and he stopped hanging out with us because he didn't want to be sad when he moved. This is what Shannon told Chris Justin told her, and she has no reason to lie, so I believe her. Pretty simple explanation for Justin's wiggage, and it came as a shock to some (Chris) but not to me, because I always half expected this. Well Justin you have been my friend for a long ass time, and you always will be. It never changed, even when you banned us and shit, I stuck to my guns. Good luck in PA, and I hope it's better for ya up there. We will meet again, Fat Ju$....Enough with the mushy crap though. I beat Louie in a foot race!!! HAHAHA! I thought it was funny, and very envigorating to beat that dunce. I did it easily too, so I'm definitely the fastest man in the world, yep I'm convinced. You're next Mr. Martin.  Yep yep, welp that's it for today ya goobers. It was mighty long, and I hope it was slightly interesting. I don't care though, love it or hate it I'm not gonna change it, because at the moment Dave... must.... sleeeeeeep. Hey Jesseca - Me and you, in your metal bed, ASAP. Haha you have a metal bed.

      Put a fork in me, I'm done...Just kidding. Done I am not, and done I never will be. I had to say that, just to reassure everyone. Not to sound like a total geek here, but I was inspired by Nintendo's speech about being here to stay, and all that good stuff. It was pretty good. I'll tell you what was not pretty good though, Halloween. It had to be the worst Halloween ever. My plan to be a Power Ranger fell through, the costume was way too small, it wouldn't even go on my shoulders (well it would but I couldn't move an inch, seriously). Chris and Louie were Power Rangers though, so that was pretty funny. It was humorous watching these two giant Power Rangers walk around with their costumes going way up their ass and nuts, but that was about the only cool thing this Halloween. I didn't get very much candy, and everyone went in way too early, at about 8 there wasn't anyone out except for us. Us = Me, Chris, Lauren, Brittany, Louie, and some crazy slut from Lopez that nobody knew except for Lauren. It was pretty boring, I wish I would have went with Jesseca and her gang, it seemed like they had more fun than I did. For some reason Halloween is on the decline, kids these days don't appreciate it as much as we used to. In addition, there is more parents who are too scared to let their kids go trick or treating because of terrorism, their religion, and such. Or maybe not as many kids have been going because it is on a school night. Well next year we won't have that problem, it's gonna be on friday! Yep, next year should be the best. I'll be 16 and have a car, so there's not much that could make it suck. Nothing that I can foresee anyways. There was one other thing that was pretty cool about Halloween night. When we were riding home Chris stuck his head out the window and yelled at some kids, and they said something back, we were like what the fuck, lets kick these kid's asses. So Louie slammed on the brakes and went after them in reverse. Right when we hit the brakes two out of the three went running into the woods. We were yelling a bunch of crazy threats like "you're gonna die bitches", it was fun. We parked nearby and started yelling at them to come out, but they were being pussies. The kid that didn't run was being a major puss, and it was funny as hell. He was all like "I didn't say nuthin man, they were just playing around, don't kill them". We were like "we're just gonna beat your ass then" and he's like "I didn't say nuthin ahhh". We were acting all mad, and Louie had his brass knuckles on, so I bet we scared the shit out of those kids. Ha Ha Ha.  The NBA season has begun and I am happy as a pig in shit. Things are going pretty much as I expected, except for a few suspensions affecting things. Tracy Mcgrady is really surprising me, GO MAGIC! Speaking of basketball and the NBA, I completed my season on NBA2k2. I'm a year late, I know, but it's still a HUGE accomplishment for me. Who else played through the whole season with 8 minute quarters, finishing a league record 73-9, with a 78.4 shooting percentage and a 20 point margin of victory. Not too many people. Now I just have to sweep my way through the playoffs and I'll be happy. First up, the Nuggets. You little nuggets better watch out, because Chris Webber is gonna flush your whole team down the toilet, because he is unstoppable! By the way, Chris Webber was the points leader, defensive player of the year, and MVP. Enough about my NBA2k2 dominance though, as I'm sure nobody knows what the hell I am talking about anyway... I didn't really do much this weekend as far as outside activities go. Well I did go play basketball at Hurst on friday, I did pretty good, but I'm sure it was pure luck. One thing that surprised me was that Hurst is freaking overrun with black people now. I looked like they built a bridge from Africa straight to the basketball courts, there were millions of them. Not that it was a problem, most of them were cool, at least they didn't try to jump us or anything. It's still fun to go there, even though everyone's skill level far exceeds mine since I haven't played in forever. I think as long as I just act like I'm good and make some shots every once and a while they will just think I'm sucking it up that day, and not that I suck completely. I need to start stretching out again so I can dunk, because even fat ass Julian can dunk now...  The rest of my weekend was mostly me laying around watching Steven Seagal (the old school badass, he always spits out the cheeseball lines) movies and playing videogames. Louie came to my house at like 10:00pm on saturday asking if he could crash at my place because he punched his dad in the face, so I was like "yea". It's always cool with me when people want to stay the night, I don't care. We didn't talk much because we were both tired, but he did tell me he got some new 15's in his car, sounds cool to me, but I didn't see em yet. Whenever I woke up this morning he was gone, I thought that was kind of funny, especially since he left his hat on my dresser. He came back to get his hat around noon, he said he went surfing, ahhh that explains it. He also said he was gonna come back after he changed out of his surfing gear, but he didn't. It was alright though, I had to play some NBA2k2...Before I finish up I have three quick tidbits. 1)Rumor has it that John is out of jail, but nobody has seen him yet, and nobody has had the guts to call him or go to his house. 2) I went to the mall (and K-Mart) with Amber, Kim, and Jesseca on wednesday of this week. It was fun. 3) The only thing that bothers me about this journal is that it doesnt have a place for people to write comments about what I wrote. But that's ok because I am probably better off not knowing what people think about what I write, that way I won't change. Most of the time people just write mean, unintelligible bullshit in the comments section anyways, so I don't think I'm missing much... Umm I think that's about all that's happened to me recently. I think there hasn't been as much activity going on due to me being in love with Jesseca, and my friends being bored with me talking to her all the time. Sorry guys, we will wig out one of these days to make up for it. In any case, I must go, later yo, I love Jesseca so.

      Here we go again...you've heard this all before, I know, but here's my take on the whole new years speech-- Another year has passed by and left us all high and dry. Another New Years Eve spent sitting at home, watching the big ball drop in New York City. The past year has been one with ups and downs, just like any other one. Justin moved to Pennsylvania, Chris moved to Shadow Lakes, Louie got his car, me and Zac became bestest friends, me and Jesseca became bestest lovers. There was a new Star Wars, a new Lord of the Rings, and a new Harry Potter, of all things. At the beginning of the year we were in 9th grade, now we're in 10th, it's all going by so fast. So many things happened this past year, good and bad, happy and sad, some that were great and some that weren't really worth the wait, some things that I hate, some things that I won't remember, and some things that I'll never forget. So much mischief was in the air, so much fun we had, I had my friends and family to spend it with, and for that I'm glad. Goodbye 2002, I had fun, it was rad.  I know there was some inconsistencies in that little "poem"(I guess you could call it that), but you'll have to excuse me since I whipped it up rather quickly. Not bad though.... LOL, rad. I was trying not to buy into the hype this year, but what the heck, HAPPY NEW YEAR!  On a side note, I've never written two journal entries in one day before, and I won't do it very much in the future, so how's that for doing something special for the occasion?

      *WARNING: DORK ATTACK COMING UP, LOOK OUT FOR THE BIG/ GEEKY WORD USAGE GALORE*...Wow wow wow wow wowzaaaas. I am so totally amazed and utterly mesmerized right now it's not even funny. It may seem like I am blowing this whole thing out of proportion, and maybe I am, but that is just how I feel right now. No matter what the case, I am still reeling over how much of a profound impact this had on my state of mind, and happiness. It's crazy, ludicrouse even. By now you are certainly wondering what it is that I'm babbling about. Let me tell you what I'm talking about....I am talking about Citizen Kane. It's a movie, a really old movie(1941 is the year it was released, and yes, it is black and white), one that few people have seen, and one that is not very popular among the general public. It is all these things but nonetheless superb. If you want more opinions on this ask a qualified movie buff(I don't think you can be considered one without first watching this movie). I won't even begin to describe what it's about, as that may ruin it for everyone, although nobody will actually watch it, especially since it would seem like I completely overhyped it once they watch it. But I will say that the movie is simply  sublime . I also must say that a second viewing is pretty much required, otherwise you will be left with horrendous first impressions, like me when I finished watching it for the first time. At first my thoughts were "what the fuck is this old-ass black and white, boring, trash-bullshit, how could anyone say this is anywhere close to being the best movie of all time!".  This lasted a while, then near the end of the movie I started thinking "well this isn't bad, but it still shouldn't be considered the best ever". After the ending I was freakin confused as all hell, I didn't get the point at all. Then when you think about it for a good hour you realize the point of the movie, and it all comes into focus. At this point you should really watch the movie again, and this time through it will be magnificent entertainment, engaging the whole way, and very very interesting. That's how it was for me anyways....One last thing: this movie is brilliant.*THIS SIGNALS THE END OF THE DORKNOCITY*  Another movie that I watched in past few days is A Clockwork Orange, it was awesome as hell. This one would appeal to a much larger audience than Citizen Kane, and it is more entertaining the first time you watch it. I recommend this one to everyone, with special emphasis on punkers, teenagers, and anyone who likes sex and violence. How much sex and violence is involved? I'll have you know that this movie was banned in the U.K. until recently(since it's release in 1971) and is still considered a "porno" by many here in the U.S., including my uncle Guy. Rent it.  Enough about these silly moobies though, it's Christmas time! Well today is Christmas Eve(albeit very early in the morning) and I am happier than I thought I would be. Up until recently I wasn't too excited about Christmas, but then out of nowhere, earlier on today, I started to be excited about it. It is gonna be so fun opening all my presents, hanging out with my cousins, and rockin around the christmas tree. Okay so I made that last one up, so what? The other two will still be fun. I also left out out the most important thing to me this Christmas season, my sugarpie honeybun: Jesseca. It is because of her that i've been looking forward to Christmas Eve more than Christmas itself because I am going to her house on Christmas Eve and I won't see her on Christmas. I love my Jesseca...and you know how the saying goes: "All I want for christmas is you(doo doot doo)".  That's about all I can think of right now since my mind is clogged by all this Citizen Kane nonsense, but normally I would torture you people with a much longer post, consider yourselves lucky. Oh yeah, and on a side note...PARTY AT CHRIS'S DAD'S HOUSE - FRIDAY NIGHT - BE THERE OR BE SQUARE! TALK TO CHRIS FOR THE DETAILS! Besides that though, they call me Charles Foster Kane because i'm outta this joint. (joints are filled with marijuana, I bet nobody knew that ::sticks tongue out::)

      I....am....so....pissed...off...mostly because I went to the movies and saw Lord of the Rings today right when I got home from school, the movie was great and all that but it's what happened afterwards that makes me mad. I had no ride home, and Chris's dad came and got Chris but the fucker had the nerve to just leave me and Louie there. He could've at least let us use his cell phone or dropped us off at my street since it was on the way.  Especially since I gave him a ride there, not to mention home from school, but "nope". Well next time he needs a ride home from school (which is an everyday basis as of now), that's gonna be my response, "nope". So the movie got out at like 7 o clock and I was walkin around the movie theater/ the surrounding areas for like 2 hours waiting for a ride before me and Louie just decided to walk home. That really burned me up man, it is a such a long ass walk, ahhhh. Plus our shoes got extremely dirty on the way home, we were hungry as hell, and our day and night was ruined by wasting all that time walking(and both of us had plans). Another thing that's kind of angering me, but not as much, is that Nintendo made zero announcements of any kind, nevermind ones of the "megaton" sort. But that's not all, when I get home I hear that Amber was freakin out on Jesseca tellin her to break up with me and shit. For some stupid reasons too, maybe if she had a valid, reasonable point, then I wouldn't care. Here's what I have to say to all of that crud: "Bleh".  There was one good thing that came out of the walk home though, and that is WEEZIN THE JUICE!!! That's where you go up to those Coke sprayers (like the ones at fast food restaurants) and put your mouth right on it and drink it. It's awesome doing that, the best thing about it of course would be that it's free...We had final exams today, and guess what? They were easy as hell, I totally wasn't expecting them to be so friggin easy, that's what happens I guess...Ahh I try to change the subject or talk about something else but all I'm really thinking about right now is how much I miss Jesseca. I wish I could go over her house right now and just lay down beside her and go to sleep, that would be awesome. So if you happen to see Jesseca do me a favor and tell her I love her, thankssssss man(heh, Lou)Yeah I'm wiggin out, goodbye.

      What's the difference between today and tommorow? It seems to me that they are lightyears apart. Let me explain. Today is a day of mostly sitting and waiting, because tommorow, as it turns out, is when all the action starts. You're probably wondering what action i'm talking about...Well I'll tell ya. First of all, we have final exams in two out of my four classes, Geometry and U.S. History. Neither of those really matter though since my grades are all but locked up. I have an A in History, since that test is gonna be a cakewalk for a History buff like me. Geometry, however, is a whole other story. I have a D in there right now and it's most definitely gonna stay that way because even if I get a 100 on the exam (which is 15% of our grade) I can't raise my grade up to a C. So that just goes to show you how bad I have it with that class, but at least i'm passing. And before you go calling me dumb and all that you need to realize that I have A's and B's in all my other classes, it's just that I fucking  hate  my geometry teacher, you don't even know how much I do. It just goes to show you how much of a turd she is, making an intelligent kid like me nearly fail her class because of her immature and annoying antics. Enough ranting though, i'm making it seem like I actually care, when I am so far from caring. To finish off this subject, after going to 1st and 2nd block Thursday to take the finals in those classes, school will be done for  2 WEEKS! (two weeks, two weeks?). And it could not have came at a better time, I am so friggin schooled out it's not even funny. I don't know how much longer I could have gone on without a break, ahhh...Back to the main topic, the second thing I am waiting for is The Two Towers of course! This movie is gonna be awesome, the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the first one was probably my favorite movie of all time. I can't wait to see it man, I already read some insane reviews for it, saying it's everything they expected and much more, muahaha. Some gook (coughZACcoughcough) told me that it came out today and got all excited, I was gonna go see it right when I got home, but I realized he was just being dumb. I knew I shouldn't have believed him though, I'm like never wrong and I knew it was coming out on Wednesday, but anyways...it's gonna rock. The third and final thing I am awaiting is Nintendo's upcoming "megaton" announcement. Here's the scoop: A long time ago, about two months or so, there was a report(most likely a rumor) that Nintendo was planning on releasing an announcement of "megaton" proportions sometime in December. The time passed by without any news of it, and now that it's December websites are again reporting that Nintendo will annouce it very soon, as in today. Even CBS/CNN reported on it this time, sort of making it not just a rumor anymore. I've been looking on websites all day for some sort of news but I was told that it won't actually be on any sites until tommorow, because it takes so long to update the sites. So naturally, I am eager to hear what the hell the announcement is about, because "megaton" means frickin HUGE....And yes I'm aware that this list started leaning towards extreme geekiness in the last two things, hehe. But nevertheless, my mood is one of great anticipation, whether it be of my final exams, The Two Towers, the "megaton" announcement, or the massive amounts of fun that i'm going to have over this christmas break.  A couple of interesting things did happen today though...There's this large Italian kid that everyone was talking about today who said his dad was in the movie "The Godfather". So me being the hardcore skeptic that I am wigged the fuck out about his dad not being in the Godfather. Besides, what are the chances? I mean, just because the kid is italian doesn't mean his dad was in the Godfather, and I had plenty of reasons to believe he wasn't. Like: That movie is really old and my dad would be like 12 when it came out, so his dad must be pretty old if he was in it. The kid is crazy, and he could just be lying, because that's like saying my grandpa is in fuckin Gone With the Wind or something, its crazy, implausible, ya know? Well it turns out that this motherfucker wasn't lying, his dad really is in the Godfather, I checked the credits and it says his name right on there. He showed me right? That's what you would think, but frankly, I don't give a damn, since I was arguing mostly for the sake of arguing. It was funny anyways, I got a good laugh out of it. From now on I'm gonna tell everyone that my dad is in Scarface, because he's Cuban. Or better yet, my dad is Al Pacino himself, lol....But that's not all folks, I made yet another discovery today: Slayer fuckin rocks!!!! They are about as hardcore as it gets and they know how to rock the fuck out. I had never heard any of their music before and they simply blew me away, blew me out of the water, they can play some of the awesomest guitar riffs i've heard. And I dig their lyrical style, as cheesy as it may be. They sing about "DEATH TO YOUR SOUL, BANISH THE DEVIL BLAHHHHH!!!!", you know what i'm talkin about. If anyone wants to know how to start a hard-core band, they should listen to Slayer, that's all i'm gonna say.  Now I'm gonna go finish watching my movie, it's called The Beast Within, or some shit. I rented it on friday but I haven't watched it yet, but it started off pretty cool. So far some chick got raped by a beast, she got pregnant (she thought by her husband), and had a kid. Now she's just finding out, when the kid's all old that the kid is starting to mutate into this beastly creature and murder everyone. That's all that happened so far, and I'm like 5 minutes into it, so it should be tight. You would think I would be studying right now with all these final exams coming up, but nope, my no studying policy remains in place.  p.s. I was just thinking about it and I realized this post was long, boring,  and  pointless. Totally without humor I might add, but meh, I laugh at the fact that it's trash, lol.

      Wowee, I haven't written in a long time. I think that's because I've just been telling all my friends my little stories individually instead of writing em on here for everyone to read. One thing's for sure, the reason I haven't been writing isn't due to nothing happening. I've been wigging out every day and night. Take the last two days for example. Last night we stole 3 eggs out of my refrigerator to go egg Brain Beard's house, we did it, but then we ended up going to 7-11 and buying three more cartons of eggs, one for each of us (Me, Zac, and Louie). We egged so many freakin houses, along with countless cars, including 2 cop cars. Then we went to the movies and chilled there for a long ass time, what we were doing there was beyond me, I was just goin with the flow. Everything was closed, save for a couple movies that were still running, so we talked to the movie theater folk and bullshitted with the cop that was there. This one guy was the man at this one arcade game, he knew like every shortcut and he was the owner of every high score on the machine. After a while John came out and was threatening Louie because he owed him money or something, I don't really know what was going on though. He gave him half of the money (five dollars, whoopdedoo), and John went back into his movie. Even later Chris and Shannon came out, Chris left, Shannon stayed, and Louie and Zac went in and talked to Shannon for a little while. I of course stayed in the car for this duration of time due to my hatred of Shannon. After that we went home I believe. I don't remember too much after that, maybe we watched one of the six movies we rented, or maybe we didn't, even though every single one of them was shitty. Today, which is Saturday(despite what the journal nazi may tell you), was fun too. First we went and hung out at the mall for a few hours, we originally went there to see Jesseca, but we ended up wiggin out too. It took us forever to find the Jessmyster and when we did they were about to go so my time spent with her was minimal. But she did have some crazy nigger with her that she didn't know, and she was wiggin out, but she did say I was hot (for a white boy) so I can't diss her too much. Jill was there too and she was really high, so she was freakin out. She had some cut/ bruise on her eye and she claimed she fell repeatedly although it was obvious that she didn't fall. Eventually she admitted that she got in a fight with some black girl, I laughed at that, haha. After Jesseca left Louie, Zac and I kooked out at the mall some more. We got into a little scuffle with a group of niggers, I don't know if you could call it that, since it was just trash talking back and forth and such, no actual fighting. It was funny as hell though because Zac kept messing with this one and he was like "man don't touch me" and he rubbed his bald head. The little nig didn't do anything though, he was acting like a real puss. The closest it came to a fight was out in front of the food court entrance. The kid was like "construction worker motherfucker, look like ::mumble munble::" and Zac said "these boots are awesome, they're lugs you wish you had em". We were walking away at the time so the kid goes "come back here and say it to my face" so Zac turns around, holds out his hand to stop oncoming cars, goes up to the kid's face and goes "these are lugs". There was pushing and shit but nobody got hit. Zac didn't wanna swing on the little nigger because there was a big nigger right beside him backin him up, and another one just standin around. He shoulda though because if that big nigger jumped in I woulda knocked him the fuck out, I was behind him and ready to pounce, he wouldn't have seen it comin. I'm sure Louie woulda helped me out too, not that I needed it. Those kooks avoided a hardcore beatdown, that's all I know...After that incident we spent the next hour or so riding around screaming at people out of the car window. If you have never done that, take my word for it when I say it's one of the funniest things ever. Especially when you come up behind them and scream at the top of your lungs so they get all scared and jump. Oh man, thats good stuff....I went to Jesseca's house for the rest of the night, and that was fun. Her sister's crazy ass boyfriend drove me home in his old school Firebird(I think that's what it was, haha), so that was funny.  My life is pretty damn good right now, I've been havin a lot of fun lately and I'm happy as your grandpappy, so hahaha.

      It's Thursday once again, it came faster than I expected. Things are moving along nicely. It seems to be getting progressively warmer as the year goes on, which is good thing. The cold was fun while it lasted(not that it's over yet), but it's starting to get old now. Besides, it does weird things to me when i'm tired, like making my legs feel weird, and as a result making me walk around school like some kind of retard. Retards, now that I mention them, are hilarious. I sometimes see them walking(or rolling in weelchairs) through the halls and everytime I wonder what the hell are these kooks doing here? It's obvious that they are retarded, so why are they even at school? I guess so people like me can laugh at them. If you ever look at them, specifically the down syndrome ones, they all look the same and it cracks me up every freakin time. I don't know what it is, maybe they just look crazy by nature, but it cracks me up. I usually don't laugh at the older ones for some reason, just the youngins. Maybe it's because I tend to respect my elders, even if they are crazy lookin motherfuckers.  Disorganization is a very bad thing, I learn that every six months or so when I have to clean out my backpack or room, but still I make no effort to organize things in advance. Like I used to say, there is "no need." I'm not sure what is going on right now in my programming class. I'm just sitting here typing this, blatantly off task, and nobody else seems to be doing work either. I suppose it is a free day. Sweet! My English teacher Mr. Phillips would never allow this. He works us to the bone, but that's the way I like it. All work and no play makes Dave a smart boy. I have to do so much homework tonight for that class, I have to write two essays, do six pages of homework, and type up one other essay. I brought it upon myself though, I had a week to do it but I procrastinate and it finally caught up to me. It should be alright though, I had nothing better to do today. General Robert E. Lee of the Civil War was once quoted for saying "Duty is the most sublime word in the English dictionary", and in most respects I agree with him.  Spanish class is next and it's pretty cool. I have learned to like Senor Gamache, even if he does enforce the dress code on girls who wear small articles of clothing, which leads me to believe he's gay, but is probably just his Christianism. Besides that he's really cool and I think he's a good teacher. Much better than my eighth grade Spanish teacher Mrs. Shideler, who couldn't speak English for shit. I have learned more at this point in Gamache's class than I did in a whole year in Shideler's. It is a good thing he changed our seats around yesterday, because there was this fuckin nasty ass girl that sat next to me and if I had to look at her one more time I would have puked, and that is an understatement. She had a freckly face, extremely small head, nappy hair, mole covered body, the whole nine yards. Oh my god it disgusts me just thinking about her. I didn't even care if it was an attractive girl that got moved next to me, a guy would be fine, just move that ugly ass bitch! So now a guy sits next to me, which is a huge improvement.  A couple days ago, in Spanish, this kid suddenly started crying. At first I felt sorry for him because he has cancer and he's going bald from the kemo, so I thought he had a breakdown and started thinking about dying or something. Everyone was looking at him like awww. So Mr. Gamache goes up to him and is like "What's up?", but he just keeps crying. So he's like "What's wrong?", the kid says nothing. Gamache asked him a couple other questions until, at length, he said "You don't know how to do the work?", and the kid shook his head yes. After that, me and the rest of the unsympathetic people in the class started laughing at him. It was funny because the people next to him were trying not to laugh after they heard that, so they were all turning around and letting out their compressed laughter. I would have none of that, I was openly pointing and laughing at this kook. Cancer or not, why would you cry about not knowing how to do something? It is nothing to cry about, and that would do no good. All I have to say is, what a wuss.  I just noticed that I have a stain on my pants. It's in a weird place too, like the inside of my leg, how crazy. It is also an odd color, some type of light brown, it looks like rust or something. Oh yeah, it's from that Yoohoo I drank this morning, I spilled it all over myself. It's cool though, the milk stain combined with my crazy hair makes for an interesting and stylish ensemble. On an unrelated note, what is with all these people(Ricky, Dan, the Werewolf Kid) defending Stuart? Are they not aware that he is a major league cakeboy? Come on man he is like the star player. Everytime Louie, backed up by me, tries to tell them that he's a fagety fucker they always respond with "no he's not gay, he has a girlfriend, he has a Z, he's awesome, he's the pimp." Alright you queers, why must you do this? Do you normally defend homosexuals or are have you recently came out of the closet? In any case you should stop because it doesn't look very cool. I mean WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE, STUART IS A FAG BITCH. Anyone in their right mind who has seen him cannot deny that. Nevertheless, I will adress and dismiss the statements that were made in his defense individually. He has a girlfriend? Well she's fat and ugly, a possible reason of why he went gay in the first place. "He has a Z, so he's the man in my book." Ok, well not in mine. For one, he didn't pay for that car, he got it from his richy rich parents. So that doesn't even count. If anything it makes him even more of a worthless booger, and a spoiled brat. For two, Zs are not cool. I don't think so anyway. If he wants to be a big shot why didn't he get a Ferrari or a Viper, or some other sort of luxury car. Zs aren't shit compared to anything like that. Lastly, he's in wrestling, and he reportedly sticks his finger up peoples asses. Now if that ain't gay then I don't know what is.  As for the question of what i'm doing this weekend, the answer much more fullfilling than last week. On Friday, once again, it is undecided. I think I have some stuff to do if nothing else arises, like get to sleep early so i'm rested up for the activities of the next day. Saturday is a whole different story. The plan is to get up around 10, gather the troops, and head to Hurst fairly early. We usually have a hard time getting there early, but if all goes right then saturday will be different. We have a great dicathlon planned, basketball and football. It may not sound so great, but it is going to be the shit. It's gonna be Alan, Chris, Zac, Mike, Louie and I, and every one of us is hyped about it. I for one can't wait. Hopefully the day will live up to all our expectations and will be fun as hell. The dicathlon won't be the end of it either, afterwards Chris and I are going to the movies to see Darkness Falls, which should scare the crap out of us, but probably won't. Then we will go back to my house and party the night away(most likely play video games/ Magic). I don't know what i'm doing Sunday, but sometime this weekend, Friday or Sunday, I have a few things to do. Among them are going to the flea market to purchase various videogame related materials, hanging out with Jesseca, and going to the card shop to participate in a MTG tournament, and win.  LoL! This fatty just fell backwards in her chair and now everyone is laughing at her histerically, including myself. With that to keep in mind, i'm leavin.

      Matt: What is in this drink? Chris: Splurk! Dave: Pits!  Hahaha. Oh man that was hilarious...I didn't write yesterday, ruining my streak of 5 days in a row, and combined with today's post it would have been the first time I ever wrote every day for a week. Not this time though, maybe the next.  Yesterday was pretty cool, but we(we = me, Zac, Mike, Chris, and Alan) didn't do much, and if we did I forgot. All I remember is we went to Hurst pretty late, around 5 I guess, and nobody was there. We went there with only a football because our basketball was flat, so were hoping the Hursties would be there with a ball, but they weren't. When we got there and noticed that there was nobody was there we just decided to stay and play football. I think it was an awesome decision. I had a lot of fun playing football, I haven't done it in forever. The teams were me and Chris vs all and we beat them, of course. I was QB throwin the passes of perfection and runnin it like a madman at will, and Chris was the reciever and mossed all over everyone. The second game it was Chris and I vs Alan and Mike. They actually put up more of a fight without Zac, so that was cool. Third me and Chris played everyone again, we scored once then Zac quit so we just stopped playing. I think everyone had fun, except for Zac(he's more of a soccer dude) and maybe Mike. I only wish we had some better competition, or at least one more player so we could play 3 on 3, that would make it more interesting for sure.  Last night we played Magic(:The Gathering) until like 3 in the morning, and we've been playing all day up until this time(me and Alan anyways), I had a blast. It was fun to play that again. It rekindled my love for the game and it has me thinking about it even now. I made some trades with Alan and improved my deck significantly, it is pretty damn good now, and it was already kick-ass before. And all you bitches at the cardshop are goin down one of these days, i'm gonna compete in a tournament, and i'm gonna kick allllllll yo asses!! Just to clear something up for you suckas who think we're dorks for playing Magic. We are not dorks. It's that simple. We used to go to the cardshop in sixth grade(I think it was, maybe seventh and eigth a little bit), and even then we could tell everyone there was dorks. We didn't fit in because we weren't dorky enough for them, we weren't one of the regulars. So the whole time we've played Magic we've just kind of laughed at the dorky types who play and dominate them, all while avoiding the negative stigmatism of being called dorks. If you still think we are then you can bite my dong because that is not the case.  I know this was kind of short and sucky today, but you can't expect too much on Super Bowl Sunday. Right now i'm gonna get in the shower, eat a shitload of food, and get ready to watch the game. I cannot wait for this one, it's gonna be awesome!

      Bleh, I was trying to write one of my traditional, long, in-depth journals, but after repeated failed attempts, I gave up. It looks like this time, that just won't cut the mustard. So as an alternative i've decided to just straight up tell you what happened today, as if I was talking to you.  The day started off with Chris and I at my house. It was pretty boring actually, we were just sitting around doing nothing. Then Jesseca called and just plain infuriated me. She shouldn't have even called if she was just going to tell me that she isn't doing anything with me this weekend, and instead she's just going to hang out with Amber and Beau(I think that's how you spell it, although I could give two shits how it's spelled since it is  the  gayest name ever, and yes it is a boy). What good could possibly come from telling me this? None. Then she tells me that i'm probably not gonna be able to come with Amber and them to the movies(even though I sort of just assumed I could go with them, it's not that outrageous of a thing to think. but alas, assuming makes an ass out of you and me), because it's Amber's birthday. I don't see what difference that makes, this is not kindergarten anymore, you don't have to baby the fucking birthday girl. Thanks for ruining my plans. And what the hell is going on with this Beau kid? Doesn't he have better things to do than hang out with my girlfriend? Supposedly he has a girlfriend, but where the hell is she at... I am convinced that he is a rapist fag, but hey, it could just be me. I don't care what anybody says, there are no guys in the world that hang out with friends that are girls on the weekends with purely platonic intentions, there are  zero ,  nada ,  none . You may say "but this" and "but that." But nothing, it just doesn't happen. I think I would know how a guy's mind works... If it did somehow happen then there are two possibilities: either the guy is gay, or really fuckin weird. If he's gay, then that is, well, gay. If he's really fuckin weird then what the hell are you doing hanging out with him in the first place. I forget what I'm trying to say here, but the moral of the story is this Beau character is a girlfriend steal attemptin male-whore loser who needs to get some friends that aren't females, and especially that aren't my girlfriend, anyone but her and i'm fine with the fag.  After I listened to some Taking Back Sunday and supressed my anger (not got rid of it), Louie came over. We didn't have anything to do so we were kind of confused at first, then we went to Frank's. There was some sort of drug deal going on, but since i'm not a narc I won't disclose the parties involved or any sort of details like that. I will disclose this though: Frank is the craziest kid ever. He's all calm one minute and concentrating on rolling a blunt, or whatever it is he does, and then in a split second he'll yell some craziness and then laugh the most insane laugh I have ever heard. He seriously sounds like a psycho, I swear. I kinda dug his room though, it is kind of like Alan's old room, with Magic cards laying all over the place and toys and gadgets from the past scattered throughout. For example, there was a stop sign, a construction cone, and one of those circular things from the road work areas that have that flashing yellow light on the top. Pretty cool stuff. The plan was for Louie and I to go to find out what time Darkness Falls starts, then come back. Instead we just went driving around and left Chris at Frank's to fend for himself. At first we were just randomly cruisin around town, with no real goal in mind. We even went to some broken ass drive through restaurant called Gary's something or other and it was so old and crazy it was funny, I was like "what the fuck is this man?". After some time Louie distracted me by telling me some joke and I was so busy laughing at it I didn't even realize it when we had arrived at Emily Vulpi's house. What a surprise. We usually end up there whenever we drive around, but she has never been home when I was there, but today she was. We went in there and chilled with her for a little bit. It was cool to see her again, I haven't done that in a long time, but we've known eachother for many years. The time we spent with her was entertaining because she had a lot of stuff to say and stories to tell and stuff, she's just really outgoing. I think she's one of those people that would get annoying after a while, but she's ultra cool in limited doses. She wanted to go to her friend's house in Port Orange, and because time was not a factor and we had nothing better to do, we gave her a ride there. The ride there was pretty fun. Louie's mom's car was our vehicle for the day, and the speaker is blown in that mutha, so that kinda sucks but eh, it still works. When we got to Port Orange we met this kid named John that was with her friend, and we went in his house while the girls went to put their stuff at the girl's house. This kid John seemed pretty cool. He was the total thug type, which is fine by me. The funniest thing about this situation though, I will explain now...sometime in the past week John Nealon and his gang of Ormond Beach thugs(Adam Wagner and the like) all went to some Port Orange party(a 50+ person double kegger) with baseball bats and tried to beat everyone down. What happened though, was the opposite. The mob of over 50 kids immediately saw them, ran out of the house, chased them down, and beat the living shit out of them. This wasn't no pussy beatdown either, these kids got annhilated. Some of them ended up with broken noses, bruised ribs, and more injuries i'm sure that put them in the hospital. They got humiliated too, the Port Orangies trashed their van to the extreme, stripped them of their clothes, and threw them in some gutters. The funny thing is, this kid John that we just met was involved in the beating, and was one of the Port Orangies, and the event occured right down the street from his house, that we were at. I don't know about you, and I doubt anybody knows what i'm talking about, but I thought that was really crazy.  After the girls came back we just sat around John's room for a while before getting sick of it and leaving. Once again we were driving around with no purpose or destination. Until we decided to go to Morgan's, we figured why not, it was sort of in the neighborhood. Before we got there I started having second thoughts about it, I was thinking about how weird it would be to see her after not seeing her for like a year or so. It wasn't seeing her that bothered me the most, I especially didn't want her mom and dad, they might wig out on me or something. I didn't want to go in, but Louie pretty much forced me to. The encounter lived up to all expectations as far as awkwardness goes, everyone in the house was giving us blank stares the whole time we were there. All the while I was smiling and laughing at the craziness that was currently taking place. Actually I think I did get a smile or two out of them, well Morgan and her mom at least, mostly because I didn't stop smiling. She showed us around her house, which was cool because I hadn't seen it since it was just concrete and wood, when it was first being built. I have to admit that I was impressed, it turned out pretty damn nice, it didn't look like much when it was under construction, but now it was lookin grand. I probably shouldn't be surprised though, her mom  is  an architect. There was a bunch of stuff around the house that would lead you to believe that she's rich(new Sony TVs for example), but I know otherwise. When we were done with the little tour we just hung around the kitchen talking about a bunch of boring stuff. The situation seemed kind of tense, but I wasn't feeling that way at all, I wish everybody would have loosened up a little. Didn't happen though, and I was kind of dissapointed that we didn't get to talk about anything interesting. I guess that's what ya get when people aren't used to foreign intruders from the past invading their house. Looks wise, Morgan looked different than I remembered her in the face, but only at first. Then I realized she hadn't changed much at all, not only in the face but everywhere else. I would still say she's hot, and I still have a small amount of attraction towards her, but it is nothing I would act on. Not only because I love Jesseca, but also because she's simply a lost cause that I gave up on a long time ago.  When we left Morgan's it was sudden and abrupt, not to mention impolite, and neither of us got hugs or anything, which is usually a given with the female friendlies. Oh well, I think that just made it even more odd, and therefore funnier. By that time it was like 8:30-9:00 and we weren't ready to quit yet, but we had no other options. We tried to call Chris and some other people, but nobody answered, so we eventually packed it up and called it a night. I went to my house, and Louie went to his. Leaving the mystery of where Chris was unsolved.  At the present time I have learned the whereabouts of Chris, and what he did all day while we were gone, but that's not a worthy enough story to be told. The main source of comedy for today, in the form of prank calls to just about everyone, was the joke that Louie told me. It is one funny ass joke, but I won't reveal it just yet. Probably tommorow it will have a post all for itself. That approach will build more anticipation[in theory, but I don't think anyone could care less]. In conclusion, today was a day of unexpected events galore, and more fun than I imagined. It also took my mind off of Jesseca at a time when I am feeling sort of pissy towards her, which was why I liked it. My mood now stands in such stark comparison to the one I was in at the beginning of the day. When I got off the phone with Jesseca I felt like crackin some skulls, now I feel like catchin some zzzzz's. This day can be summed up by something the famous writer Charles Dickens once said, "It was the best of times, It was the worst of times."

      It's one of those days where if the work's not easy, or I am the least bit confused as to what I am supposed to do, I simply won't do it. That's why i'm sitting here in computer class doing nothing, she didn't make it clear what I had to do, so now she pays the price. She just came by and asked me "how is it coming along David?" and i'm like "uhh I don't know." I guess I fooled her with my brilliant tactics of switching back and forth between the internet and Qbasic. She underestimates my sneakiness. If you are wondering who the hell i'm talking about with all this "she" business, I am referring to the beast of a woman that goes by the name of Mrs. Parlade.  I did do some work in English today, but it was easy, we just had to draw a scene from one of the short stories that we read. Now I can at least be comfortable in the fact that I got  something  accomplished. I have been messing around with my blog template and HTML the rest of the time. It boggles my mind, I don't understand it very much, but I figured out a couple things. I must say I am slightly intrigued by it; it would be cool to actually know how to use it, but no such luck. I am sad to report that the advertisement at the top cannot be changed. It sucks, I know, but you have to actually pay money to get rid of things like that. There are no tricks to avoid it. Few things annoy me more than things that require money on the internet... my dad already pays like $50 a month for the ISP. Isn't that enough for you greedy bastards!? That money adds up you freakin computer geeks. Basically, fuck the corporate world biatch!  In other news, using my overwhelming intelligence, I have managed to change the sample links into actual links. I now have Louie's Blog, My Website, and Anti's Blog. Anti is a guy that I don't actually know. I haven't even chatted with him on the internet, let alone in real life. But I stumbled upon his blog and he seems like a really cool guy, and if nothing else, he makes me laugh. So you should check out those links, and there will be more in the future. The possibilities are endless with these links, soon there will probably be around ten or so. I just wish more of my friends(coughchriscough) would get journals or a blog, and preferably a website. That would be cool, then I would have more links and it would be like a network of friends. After that we could take over the world!!!Muahahahahaha!!! Actually that is not an option, I got a little carried away...  I hope you like the cliche "turn into maniac for a few seconds, talk about taking over the world, laugh like a mad scientist, then get control of self and act like nothing happened" routine, I think I have it down pat. Since i'm done writing and it still isn't time to go it's time for some random jibberish. "Yeah Jibberish!"  PaT mE oN tHe BaCk AnD yOu WiLl ReCiEvE a BiG oLe StEeRiNg WhEeL sTrAiGhT fRoM mY gArAgE...tHe GaRaGe Of DeAtH. dA sHaTtErEd PeNiSeS aRe At HaNd, RuN fOr YoUr LiVeS!!!  Okay... that was lame.

      Good television? I have been watching it. I just watched Joe Millionaire and Man Vs. Beast back to back, and let me tell ya, those are some quality TV shows. Whoever came up with the ideas for these shows is brilliant. I had never seen either of them before and they were much better than I expected, and I usually don't even watch TV at all, except for sports. When I was watching Joe Millionaire all I could think of was how each of these girls were going to react when he told them his secret at the end. It's not like it's something small either, they are gonna wig out man, I predict they won't still like him after they find out he's not rich. The final show is gonna be a must see for everyone who walks on two legs, and even the ones who don't. Man Vs. Beast was also a very interesting and entertaining show, i'm not sure if it was a one time special type thing or a regular series, but it was awesome. A monkey beat a sumo wrestler in tug-o-war, a sprinter beat a giraffe in a 100 meter race but lost to a zebra in that same format, a champion food eater lost to a gigantic bear in a speed hot dog eating contest, 40 midgets lost in a race to pull a jet-liner across the finish line to an elephant, and finally, a Navy SEAL beat a chimpanzee in a race through a military obstacle course. Every one of the competitions were fascinating, and some of them were amazing. If they are still deciding whether or not to make another show in the series, my vote is yes.  Last night I saw some cool stuff as well. The new American Idol competition is shaping up nicely, and if none of the people have any talent, at least they were funny to watch. Some of the craziest people ever were at the tryouts, and it was funny as hell. I wonder why these morons go to the auditions when they know they can't sing, I don't think they know or something. I'm not sure how that happens though because it is glaringly obvious... The funniest thing about it is the people think they are doing good, and they're smiling from ear to ear, and it seems like the judges are digging it(but for real they are just smiling because it's crazy/funny that these kooks cannot sing for shit), and they stop and they're like "thank you." Then Simon says something like "that was amazing" so the people get all excited and happy and start smiling and laughing and stuff, then he goes "...amazingly dreadful, you are the worst singer in the world." Oh man that Simon comes up with some of the best insults i've ever heard, and I can't tell if he is improvising or what, but for the caliber of them it seems like he stays up at night thinking of good insults to say to contestants. If that is so, I don't mind, because they still crack me up.  On a more negative note, I watched the movie XXX(pronounced "ex-ex-ex", not "triple x" ) last night. I won't beat around the bush on this one, and I won't even waste my time to think of cool sounding adjectives to describe the suckiness of this movie. I will however, say this: it is really, really bad. The best way to explain this movie is to cut off your balls, nail them to a wall, and stare at them. The feeling of immense pain and the thoughts of "what the hell is going on here" that you experience will replicate exactly the feelings I felt while watching this movie. If you're a girl you could sit on a nail to get the same effect, and as the nail pierces through your buttcheek, you'll know what I mean. I know what you're thinking, and oh yes, it really is  that  bad.  All this talk of various forms of entertainment and you think I would get bored of it, but nope, I just keep on goin. All of the previous things I mentioned are all in the past, and now i'm looking towards the future, a future that looks very promising(the near future anyways). I am so majorly  pumped  about a new movie that's coming out, you may have heard of it, it's called Darkness Falls. It looks like it's going to be one of the scariest movies in a long time. I saw a long trailer of it on XXX that got me so excited about it, before that I had no knowledge of it besides seeing short TV spots. If you are debating whether or not to go see it you should take my word for it and go, because everyone that I know that knows about it wants to see it really bad. The only two movies that I can think of that truly scared the crap out of me(I even had nightmares!)in this day and age are The Mothman Prophecies and The Blair Witch Project 2: Book of Shadows. Those are a couple of good movies, and I recommend them if you want to be scared; hopefully I can add Darkness Falls onto that list. I'll find out when I go to see it saturday afternoon with my girly girl Jesseca and her gang of munchkins. I can't wait.  I am equally  pumped  about the Super Bowl. I have plenty of things left to say about it concerning pre-game analysis, but i'll spare you because I now know that none of that matters come game time. Both teams have a fair chance to win, the only thing that will determine who does is who comes to play and who wants it more. I will be rooting for the Raiders all the way, and i've been a closet fan of them for about 2 years now, I like the coach, I like the stadium/fans(nobody likes going to the black hole), and more than anything else, I like Jerry Rice. I want them to win so badly, because I hate all these fuckin Tampa Bay fans, all of them! When I see these bastards walking around school with TB hats on it makes me cringe. I love yelling "Raiders baby oohh yeahhh" in the manliest voice possible at them, it's great fun. Even more than the fans, I hate the team of Tampa Bay. Fuck Warren Sapp, he's a fat turd. Fuck Derrick Brooks, he's a tall skinny turd. Fuck John Lynch, he's a white turd. Fuck Keyshawn Johnson especially, he is the biggest turd of them all. That errogant faget, he has nothing to be arrogant about, he sucks big donkey dick. Pardon my french there, but damn they are gay. Nobody else on that team deserves any sort of recognition, even me calling them turds would be overdoing it, they are pure monkey doodoo.  Now that i'm done ranting about Tampa Bay's trashlike nature, I am clear to make fun of other people: people who emphasize the T in TV, as oppose to the V. What is up with that? I think these people are just uncultured or something, everyone I have ever known has always said T V , not  T V, but eh. I can't wig out on them as much as I would like to because they are normal in every way besides saying TV wrong, I just think it's kind of weird and had to bring it to the attention of all. The two people that i'm talking about in particular are Jesseca and Morgan, those are the only people i've ever heard say it that way, and it's crazy, but what are ya gonna do, it's not that big of a deal...I don't mean to sound like a weatherman here, but it is going to be cold as hell tommorow morning, and it's not going to get any better heading into the night-time hours and saturday morning. So everyone should be wearing warm clothes right? That is right, but there are always those couple idiots who go to school in shorts and a t-shirt and claim they're not cold. How in the world could you not be cold? Oh that's right(ha Jess), you're just lying about being not cold to seem cool, when in reality you're just sounding like a hardcore dumbass and you know you're freezing your ass off. I mean, i'm from Michigan, and I don't mind the cold as much as some other people. I even like it somewhat because it wakes me up and reminds me of my childhood, and as bad as it gets down here, I have always seen worse. Even so, I still have the sense to wear pants and a sweater(or a jacket would do fine, maybe better)when the temperature drops below 40 degrees. I hate people like that. The same thing goes with people who walk right by the fire alarm when it's going off and don't cover their ears or flinch at all...what the fuck is wrong with you people!? That shit is  loud ! You ain't foolin nobody when you act like it doesn't hurt your ears, you're just damaging your hearing in the long run, and for that I laugh at you. No for real, I am laughing right now at the thought of these kooks. They're like robots man, what the hell.  Ah man I feel very motivated right now, I want to do something extroardinary, I want to be challenged...Basically, I feel great. Admittedly, a lot of that comes from me taking a nap earlier, even though I only got about 2 hours of sleep at the most, it energized me to the max. The rest of it comes from the excitement that I have towards the upcoming weekend, after all it is thursday night, soon to be friday. Woohoo! All I have to do is get through school tommorow and I'm done for the week, sounds good to me. So i'm going to see Darkness Falls with Jesseca on saturday, which will be awesome whether the movie is good or bad, and hopefully i'll spend the remainder of the day with her. Sunday I have the biggest sporting event of all in store for me, the Super Bowl, that too should be phenomenal. The only thing I have to worry about is friday, I have nothing planned, so i'm hoping something unexpected and fun comes up, if not I might have to resort to using extreme prejudice and egging people's houses. In a more current time frame I am looking forward to taking a shower, doing my homework(most likely I will fall asleep before that happens, but I think I should make an attempt to do it and not be a slacker for once), and going to bed. I should probably study for my spanish test too, just for good measure, but I don't think that will be necessary because I am already confident that I will do well on it(not that you care)...There should be some sort of statistics tracker on this beast, that would be cool, because i'm always wondering how many words are in my posts, and which one of them is the longest, and stuff like that. Like this one, it pretty damn long, but thanks to these uninventful kooks I will never know exactly how long it is[you could go on to call me unresourceful for not using another program like Microsoft Word to figure this information out, but you would be mistaken, that can be attributed to my fine example of genuine laziness]. And damnit, I would like to know.  Two more factoids for those who haven't fallen asleep yet: my parents are getting it on(I know because I hear them) and I, Bib Fortuna, am wigging out.

      Goodie goodie, after minutes of deep contemplation I have finally nailed down the template that I am going to use(NOTE: It's right in front of your eyes, check it out). I think I made the best choice with the resources that I was provided, which were extremely limited. I dig the black backround and white writing and the psychadelic shiny ball [that kind of goes with the name], the orange is even cool. The only thing I don't like is how the title gets kind of washed out by the blogger advertisement at the top. I'll have to fix that, but first i'll probably need to learn some HTML. Nevertheless i'm gonna try to fiddle around with some stuff and maybe i'll be able to figure out how to do it on my own. Either that or I will mess up the interface beyond repair and cause every computer that trys to bring it up to crash. I'm not too worried about the latter though, because that would be cool.  I have limited time on my hands, so there will be nothing creative here. I'm just glad I got the journal back into working order. Also, if you check the time on some of my recent posts you will notice that I have been in 2nd block writing them, that includes this one. The bell just rang, so i'm outta here...Like the guy on my desktop always says "You're a homo."

      Stop! Hammer Time! (insert moans and groans of backup singing black men here) You know what I think of all those flames that I used to have on this thing? I'VE HAD ENOUGH!!!! I had that template for a long time, and Louie, in his infinite wisdom, chose to use the exact same one as me. So I switched it on em! Flip Mode! Flip Mode is the greatest!(that's not to say that this trashy template is final, because it assuredly is not) Also, I have been reading lots and lots of interesting blogger names that make mine look miniscule and dull in comparison, so that too, I switched on them. Word yo. Lastly, things on this journal have been taking on more of a serious tone as of late, and I think to continue writing that way would be taking a turn for the worst. So I will end this now and start employing a more fresh, comedic approach to things. So bring on the craziness!

      I look at all the lovely people! The Beatles are such a great band dude, and they are more popular than Jesus Christ(quoteth the late but great John Lennon), so eat that one. Today I was totally uninterested in school, so I didn't even make an attempt to do my work, I just went to sleep. That lack of motivation carried over whenever I got home too, I was walking around in a daze forever. Until Jesseca called that is, because I laughed forever on the phone with her and it woke me up. Here's the dialogue of the thing that got me...she was like "Oh I hope Hunter is ok" and I said "Who is Hunter?" and she's like "Oh he's just some kid from my work that went to the hospital yesterday" and i'm like "oh I see...I have a kid named Hunter in my butt." There was a slight pause, then she goes "What are you in fifth grade", and I laughed for a long time. It was really funny at the time, and I'm still chuckling to myself, you probably had to hear it though. A little later we got off the phone because her mom had to use it, and we just didn't call eachother back, haha...kinda crazy but that's what happened.  The rest of the night, up until about a half an hour ago I've been playing Shenmue II. I just started today so I was takin care of business and trying to get a good chunk of the game complete. I think I succeeded in that respect, I played for around 8 hours(I don't know for sure how long, probably more than that), and I moved swiftly the entire time. My goal to beat it is Thursday, so my weekend doesn't get clogged up with these nonsense video games. Why do I have a feeling that somewhere there is a little twelve year old kook reading this saying, "You're nonsense!!!" ?  I have a very important assignment for all of you nimrods out there who are reading this: Picture yourself in a boat on a river, with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, a girl with kaleidoscope eyyyyyes. Cellaphane flowers of yellow and green, towering over your heeeeead. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes and she's gone. *LUCY IN THE SKYYY WITH DIIIAMONDS*... *LUCY IN THE SKYYY WITH DIIIAMONDS*...*LUCY IN THE SKYYY WITH DIIIAMONDS!*

      Hahaha! I'm in 2nd block Computer Programming Class! Mrs. Parlade is wiggin out, tellin me to do a bunch of work...FUCK THAT SHIT! Lunch is in a few minutes, and I forgot my ID, so I have nothing better to do than hang out with Mr. Hillman in ISS. Oh well, at least I have some homework I can do. In addition, I am the lonely swedish and my bum is all alone. I have three things on my mind: hanging out with small people(midgets and women in particular) makes me feel taller, it is annoying when my sweater strings get wet in the water fountain, and I hate the entity that is jungle fever. Moreover, there is a bucktoothed mongolian ass-slapper(a dorky bitch with big teeth, a small head, and a crazy hat) eyeballing me, so I'm fickin to ride out. One last snippet for you bosshog worshippers: Chongissimo is[undoubtedly] the plural of Chongy.

      *Start Gangsta Rap Beat*  It's not the East or the West side. (No it's not) It's not the North or the South side. (No it's not) It's the  Dark  Side. (You are correct) You can't front on the Empire, to all you Vader haters out there: We'll blow your planet up. *Imperial March kicks in, in addition to Gangsta Rap Beat* What is thy bidding thy masta? It's a disasta, Skywalker we're after. What if he could be turned to the Dark Side? Yes! He would be a powerful ally, another dark Jedi. He will join us or die! We got Death Star, We got Dark Star...(Repeat x5)  That was just a little bit of Star Wars flava to kick things off for all you seventies dorks out there. I've been putting this journal off for long enough, so I guess I have to finally write in this biotch... Well, it's Nigger Day(quote my uncle Gino) today, so you know what that means... no school. That didn't work out to my favor very much today, it was a pretty hellacious day. I mean, the weather was nice and everything, but eh, I fuckin ruined it. I woke up expecting nothing to happen, I thought it was just gonna be one of those lazy sit around the house days, but it turned out even worse(not that those are so bad). Chris and Alan came over fairly early, right after I woke up, at around 12 or so. I wouldn't care about that normally... but  not too much later Jesseca calls and is like "i'm gonna come pick you up alright" and I was all surprised so I was like "whaaat?" and she's like "we're gonna go to the park with my sister"...or something like that, I dunno. Well being the idiot that I am I say no, because I had just made plans to go to Hurst and play basketball with the friends, and I had already got dressed and stuff(it seemed pretty sensible at the time). So I get to Hurst and shoot around for about ten minutes when I realized I had just made the stupidest decision ever. What the fuck was I thinking man? Basketball is not even that cool (and we didn't even play it really), what did I think this was "bros before hos" or something? I wanna know who originated that saying so I can go to his house and kick him in the fucking head, seriously. That is one of the most queerlike remarks a person could possibly think of... BUT, I won't let it phase me because yesterday I had an awesome time, and enough fun for two days.  So I think I'm gonna kick this shit in reverse chronological order, since variety is the spice of life. I don't know how to begin, perhaps by mentioning that Mike's mom claimed that somebody was "the salt of the earth", hahaha that's classic. Currently, my sister(the one who is 21 years of age) is running around the house in a rage, getting ready to kick some little kid's asses. You see, a bunch of little kids who are in some way or the other associated with my little sister(11) and her boyfriend(12), have been calling my house and leaving obscene messages on my answering machine and saying bastardly things to me and the rest of my family. So she's gonna go over there and kick their asses. She's gone now so i'll update you on the situation later. I also learned that Jesseca spent the day driving around with a couple of boys that were new to the neighborhood, so she had to show them around. She said they were kooks, so that sucks for her, and it confirms that we both had trashy days without eachother. That pretty much does it for today, because I already told my story about the great Hurst/ Jesseca fiasco.  Sunday...what a glorious day. I had so much fun on Sunday, it was awesome. First Jesseca, her mom, her dad, her sister, and I went to see the movie Kangaroo Jack. I must say that it was quite(lol Jess) good, despite what you may hear about it. Then we went to J-Dawgs house to watch the football game. Tampa Bay won it unfortunately, but hey, they deserved it. Now they only have one challenge left before I can accept them as being a good team...The Oakland Raiders! Have fun defending against the number one offense in the league, which consists of Rich Gannon(league MVP), Tim Brown(the seasoned vet), Charlie Garner(the young pimp), and Jerry motherfuckin Rice(i'll give you a cookie if you can name one receiving record he doesnt own), who just happens to be the best receiver ever. It should be a good Super Bowl though, #1 defense Vs #1 offense. Back on subject, I had tons of fun at Jesseca's house, I love her so much... I won't dwell on this, but I have been officially challenged. So thanks for the motivation, now Kingdom Hearts will be beaten in about 2 seconds flat.  On saturday nothing happened really, just some basketball games that I lost, but I take no responsibility for that, it wasn't my fault. Friday was a cool day though, some funny stuff happened at school...I got to school late, and as a result I got yet another lunch detention, but it was cool because I was treated to a hilarious sight. This girl was running to class full speed because the bell was about to ring, and she had high heels on, I was looking at her thinking "yeah she's gonna fall...". So I tells her this, I says "uhh you should slow down, you're not gonna make it anyways". But the bitch ignores me and keeps on runnin. Sure enough, a few seconds later she tripped on the sidewalk and landed right on her face. It was kind of crazy at first because her face was bleeding and stuff, but then I just started laughing at her, while everyone else was all concerned, haha. It was almost as funny as when Amber Ashton tripped over the big black pillow in my room.... Nothing cool happened in class until fourth block, when Chris and I were partners for this project in math that involved lots of M&M eating and a slinky, and even that wasn't outrageously cool. It wasn't until after school ended that the real fun began. Me and Chris were walking down the walkway over by the portables after leaving fourth block, and we were all happy about the three day weekend, so we were horseplaying and whatnot. So we come up by Jenna Webb and I decide to throw a balled up piece of paper at her friend. I threw it around Chris's back and it hit her right in the head(this was Jenna's friend mind you), afterwards we were both laughing histerically and we still had the task of walking by them at hand so I quickly pointed the finger at Chris. At this point Chris was like "man you're gonna get our asses kicked". A couple seconds later Matt Tower (Jenna's boyfriend, the resident "badass", and the man some people say I look like) comes up to Chris and says "Did you just throw a piece of paper at my girlfriend" and I was like "uh that was me, and it didn't even come close to your girlfriend, bitch". He's like "fuck you man, go apologize to her", like a pimp, I respond with "apologize for THIS!" and gave him a quick elbow to the chin, followed up by a swift knee to the chest and a powerful right handed blast to the face, sending him to the ground crying in a heap. But I wasn't done with him yet, I jumped on top of him and beat him within an inch of his life with my hard-as-steel fists, all while Chris gave him repeated kicks to the groin. When I was done I made him get up onto his knees and beg for mercy, and he didn't hesitate to kiss Chris's shoe and lick the dirt off the bottom of my boot. When we were done humiliating him in front of his girlfriend, and the entire school, I told him whats up. I says "apologize for that, bitch!" and we walked away while the wolfpack theme music played in the backround....Needless to say, that didn't happen, but everyone already knew the story so I had to spice it up. And now, my friends, I am really in for an ass kicking, lol.  Which reminds me of the wrestling match that we had at school on Wednesday. It was one of the most blatant displays of homosexuality I've ever seen, but besides that I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. TP slammed some little moogle into the mat like a dominator, some retard on the other team slipped on a sponge type object and got laughed at by the whole crowd, and a bunch of kooks got their nuts grabbed and their asses humped, those were the funniest things that occured. We did lose though, since we forfeited twice because we didn't have people to match their weight classes, that's how it goes I guess. It was still funny, especially when it was Stuarts turn and he got the smack down layed on him by a Deland turd. I even heard a story about him pulling a knife on his girlfriend when she told him she cheated on him, and I laughed because he's gay, and what does he care. Russel Dukes himself even wrestled, too bad he got whooped by some fatty...There was one more thing that happened on friday that's worth mentioning. As we waited for my mom to pick us up, me, Chris, Louie, and Zac were playing with a slinky. By that time the slinky had already been broken up into several little pieces so we each one. All of the sudden, out of nowhere, Louie is like "check this out guys!" and runs up to this kid Gibby and fuckin whips him in the face with the slinky. There is a slight delay in time where there is nothing but silence, then Gibby pounces on Louie, puts him in a headlock and yells crazy incomprehensible stuff into his ear. Louie then gets mad, breaks free and proceeds to hardcore insult Gibby. He called him a big headed fucker(which he is), and made fun of his richie rich, think he is better than anyone attitude(which he deserved, even though Louie did whip him in the face for no reason). In any case, it was funny as all hell.  Ah well I'm not really done, but my sister is telling me to get out of her room because she is trying to sleep, so I will finish quickly. An update for all you Cambodian asslickers who still care: my sister couldn't find the kids house, so in her words "it must be his lucky day." I'm gonna go watch Blue Crush now, it's probably gonna suck but meh...and for your information, i'm aware that the quality of my journal has been on the decline as of late, and i'm not too happy about it. But I dont think I can help it...my writing skills as a whole have been declining as well. So you'll just have to deal with it!

      I started my day off on the wrong foot when I woke up late this morning, as usual. At least I had a good reason today, but i'll get to that later. When I arrived at school I had to get me a tardy pass before I could go to class, and the line was long as ever, its amazing how many people get to school late everyday, kids these days... It was my third time being late this nine weeks and second time in two days, and it's only the beginning of the semester. Luckily all I got was "the tardy talk"... and lunch detention tommorow. The guy sounded pretty serious about us showing up too, he sounded like he would kill us or something if we didn't. And for those of you who don't know Mr/Coach Hillman, he's a rather intimidating guy, like one of those body builder types who can crush coconuts with their bare hands. So being the badass that I am I'm just gonna skip lunch detention as a direct challenge to his authority and power.  Now that I'm done talking about being late for a half hour I should probably tell what happened at school when I was actually in my classes; but we all know that's no fun, so I'll save that for a more boring day. Today however, was far from boring. Why you ask? Because I BEAT SPLINTER CELL TODAY!!! (well it was around 3 in the morning but that still counts as today, and the excitement from it remains even to this hour, so why not claim it was today) That is such an awesome game. The graphics are better than any game before it and the gameplay is unlike anything i've experienced and truly lives up to its title of Stealth Combat Redefined. The action is intense, the sound flows perfectly and does its job well. The situations the game puts you in will make you bite your nails with nervous tension and can sometimes be downright scary(scary in a surprising kind of way). Another thing that made this game so cool was that it kept you thinking about it even when you weren't playing it. I often found myself at school looking up into the ceiling of the walkway and bathrooms for pipes that I could climb on and secret entrances into buildings. Few games can do that to you, off the top of my head Tetris and Shenmue are the only ones that can make you feel like that. All these things are great but the thing that stuck out the most about this game was the challenge and difficulty level. I won't lie, it was hard, and that's a rare thing for me to say about a game. In fact i'm having second thoughts about saying it right now, i'm questioning how hard it really was, and i've decided that it was difficult enough to at least warrant me saying it was "hard". There were four or five times in the game where I was stuck at one checkpoint for hours at a time, and it was frustrating, but I know this: I certainly wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did if it was easy. As much cussing at the TV screen, beating up my pillows with my bat, and other frustration evoked behavior as there was, when I finally did beat the game it was all worth it because I felt a feeling of accomplishment I rarely feel in real life. The sad thing is a lot of people have never felt this great feeling, and they never will until they complete an awesome videogame like Splinter Cell, which for most people will not happen. Nonetheless this is what playing video games is all about my friends.  In case you haven't figured it out yet, this is the reason I was late for school today, I was up really late beating Splinter Cell. It was funny near the end of the game too, because I wasn't supposed to kill the main enemy/ terrorist guy, not before I used his eyes for the retinal scanner anyways. So I had him in a chokehold and I accidentally hit R and punched him in the back of the head (in effect killing him) and the colonel guy who commands you during the mission goes "What are you doing!?!?" and Sam (the hero) says "I killed Kombayne Nikoladze" in a crazy voice, like it was some sort of joke. Oh man it may not sound so funny put into words but that cracked me up so much. It literally made me laugh out loud, which is crazy because there I was sitting in my room alone at 3 in the morning just laughing. Then later on when the credits rolled it played that song Calling All Freaks (now that is good development right there), how brilliant of them. Because if there was anything I wanted to do at that time it was dance, and dance I did for about 10 minutes straight. When it was all said and done I decided that Splinter Cell was right up there with Halo: Combat Evolved(oh god it's funny writing out the complete subtitles of things), and tied for best game on X-Box. That is saying a lot since Halo is a virtual tour de force of non-stop heart pounding, adrenaline pumping(i'm fuckin wigging out actually) action, not to mention a modern masterpiece.  Daaaamn I talk about crazy shit forever, lol. Oh my god there is massive amounts of snot coming out of my nose!...I'm your typical snot nosed punk. Ah yes, speaking of punks, Simple Plan sucks. I listened to every one of their songs and they suck, except for the two singles they have out now. Those are the only songs that don't suffer from the monotonous bashing of drums and cymbals, un-melodic playing of untuned guitars, while the pre-pubescent lead singer ruins good lyrics with his stunning lack of emotion and feeling as well as with his over punkish, annoying voice...Wow that was some pretty hardcore bashing, I think I insulted them so much because they dissapointed me. I wanted them to be as good as some other emo bands that I like, and they had so much potential...oh well, maybe their next album will be better. Taking Back Sunday on the other hand, is awesome. If you do happen to take my word for it and listen to them be aware that it will probably sound weird at first, and that I didn't like them at all at first. The more I listened to them, the more I liked them, so just let it be known that they are definitely an aquired taste.  I only have one more thing to complain about before I end this madness. I've been reading a lot of other people's journals lately and I have seen a lot of stuff that I don't like. Grammar mistakes, word over usage, misspelled stuff galore, short posts, song lyrics, and long ass surveys are all things that i'm not too fond of, but all except for the latter I am guilty of myself at one time or another, so they don't bother me too much. But there is one thing that I cannot tolerate: people who write "I having nothing to say/write" in their journals. That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard, isn't that what journals are for? I could freak out so much more about this, but i've already wasted more than enough of my time on the computer today when I should be doing something more productive. So I only have one question to ask these people: If you have nothing to write, THEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU WRITING FOR? Is it not clear to these people that when you have nothing to write you can simply not write anything and save people the time of reading through your horrible post that came into being as a result of you not having anything interesting to say so you just wrote a shitload of mindless jabber off the top of your head? If you comprehended that last sentence and can answer it correctly then you are on your own because I, the one who wrote it, can't even fully understand it, I keep getting lost right near the end...  Well kids that's it for today, check back next time for some more inspiring and entertaining psychobabble with the everlasting enigma that is the Davemyster. That was a pretty long one there wasn't it Uncle Ronnie? " That's Right ". Ok...that was gay. I'll leave you with something even more homosexual: an old school yo mama joke. Yo mama's so big, fat and clumsy, when she tried to get to Wal*Mart she stumbled over K-Mart and landed on Target.

      At the moment I should probably be bitching and complaining, seeing as my favorite football team, the San Fransisco 49ers just got the defensive beatdown of their lives, dominated by the recievers of Tampa Bay, and sent home for the season. I am also being tormented emotionally by the fact that my girlfriend said I could come over this weekend and then later said I couldn't, for whatever reason this happened not once, but twice. Instead of being a pussy and sitting around and doing nothing about it i'm gonna take the loss like a man. I'm gonna transform all that anger (and there is plenty of it), and change it into positive, kick-ass energy, into motivation as I take out everyone in Splinter Cell. That's what i'm hoping for anyway...but in my extensive videogame experience rage has never gone a long way and is usually associated with frustration. Since i'm literally shaking with anger (I have no idea why i'm so mad now that I think about it), i'll most likely end up bashing my stereo with my baseball bat, i've been waiting for a good time to do that anyways. I think I just need to chill out though.  It would be a great time to talk about my crazy ass weekend, which was full of exciting events, so that I will do. My weekend actually started on Thursday this week because that was the day that Jesseca, Louie, Amber, Kim, and I were to hang out. It was pretty cool, we went to Mainland to do some extra credit stuff that Jesseca and Amber had to do but we ended up making fun of some kook named Winkleman, being told by some girl that she knew us when she didn't, and meeting this black kid who later called me "hard"(hey it's better than being called soft). The next night (Friday) we went to Regal to see the movie Just Married. The movie was pretty funny and we otherwise just had a good old time, i'll leave out the details. Saturday was one of the crazier days i've had in my life. Originally I was supposed to spend the day at Jesseca's house, leaving Louie at my house to do whatever he wanted, but when I found out she was mad at me (the reason I would rather not mention since it doesn't matter anymore) I was forced to stay at my house all day. What happened after that I didn't have much control over. As I sat in my room playing Splinter Cell my friends all sat around and discussed various plans for the day, eventually deciding that they wanted to get drunk and wig out. Before I knew it Chris and Zac were running around in a drunken daze while Alan(who was drunk himself but had himself under control and was acting more mature than anyone) and Chasity were trying to keep them under control. Me, Louie, and Mike were sober but we were just watching to see what kind of madness ensued. At one point in the histeria everyone ended up in the front yard because Chris and Zac were going to box. Zac gave Chris a hardcore beatdown, but it didn't matter because Chris didn't even know he was being punched or even that the match had started or what in the hell was going on, I bet if you asked Chris his name at that time he wouldn't know it. After that Chris and Alan "boxed", but the boxing match merely consisted of Alan, with one glove on, punching Chris in the face once (not even very hard) and Chris flying really far into the ground in an odd manner. After that it was clear to me that Chris had too much to drink, as if that couldn't have already been detected by his nonstop maniacal laughter throughout his boxing match with Zac, even while he was getting the shit beat out of him. So there were more attempts for people to box Chris, but it was apparent that they were just trying to take advantage of him in his drunken state, which to me was very cowardly. Once everyone calmed down again I went on the computer for a while to get away from the insanity that was going on. I stayed there until Alan and Louie informed me that Zac and Chris were crying, I didn't know why the hell they were crying but I had to see it. I waited a while, but when I went in there I saw Chris crying and it was crazy, I never actually saw Zac crying but I don't know why they would lie. Finally at around 4 Chris and Zac fell asleep(but not before puking all over my room), Mike and Louie went home, and Alan went to James's house. It was calm for a few hours while I watched the football game, then at 8 the kooks woke up and it was funny because Chris didn't remember doing anything, not boxing, not nothing. Soon after I started feeling really tired and fell asleep. During that time Chris and Alan left, leaving Zac as the sole survivor at my house.  That brings me to today...Zac left early and I was glad because I was sick of having all those people at my house. At 1 I watched the 49ers game as the phone rang off the hook and I ignored it, getting incrementally madder as the 49ers fell further and further behind. I was extremely pissed off by the end of the game, and I stayed pissed off until very recently, as recent as the beginning of this post when I started writing. I cooled off fairly fast though, and I owe that to my beautiful girlfriend Jesseca, I love you baby. I also found solace in the hope that Philadelphia will crush the Bucs next week and exact revenge for my 49ers loss. So you Tampa Bay Fucks better come to play because you're gonna be facing big McNabb, the Nest of Death, the team that knocked you out of the playoffs two years in a row, and the biggest obstacle, 26 degree weather.  So I'm much happier now than I was when I started writing this journal, and that is cool. The only thing that sucks now is I have a bunch of homework to do, but then again I probably won't do it. So hopefully I will get past this difficult part in Splinter Cell that i'm currently stuck at, but that's probably not gonna happen either. In any case I had a good week at school and I hope to duplicate that sucess this week when I head back there (I hate to admit that I have to go to school, but it is inevitable), starting tommorow. Later on cheeky boys and girls, I'm out.

      I went to the doctor today, apparently they found traces of protein in my urine. Oh man, that's too bad. It might be worse if I actually knew what that is supposed to mean, and how it's affects me...I dunno, they explained it to me but I still don't understand. Something about my liver and kidneys, seems like no big deal to me. Even if it is, I don't give a damn because I feel just fine. Anyways, school started yesterday, which makes today the second day of school...and it's already over! Hell yeah, 2 down, and umm a lot to go. I got off to one hell of a start. I didn't sleep on Sunday (as in zero hours) so my first day back to school i'm walkin around in an extreme daze of exhaustion. I was stumbling around losing my footing and shit. At some point I even thought I was going blind because my eyesight kept getting blurry for extended periods of time, but no such luck, that's what you get when you deprive yourself of sleep I guess. Now that school's back in full swing it's prime time for me to discuss the current situation with my classes and teachers. Don't panic though, I'll make it short. It goes like this: Same shit, Different year.  Onto something more important, like football. You heard it here first: (well probably not, I just wanted to say that)  the Miami Hurricanes were cheated out of the title . That was bullshit, they definitely need to employ a replay system in college football like the one they have in the NFL, maybe then undeserving faggets like the Fuckeyes will be prevented from getting cheat victories. That pissed me off, especially since it was the Championship, that was ridiculous. I forgot about that pretty quickly though, due to the victories of the Michigan WOLVERINES, Atlanta Falcons(oh my god, what a surprise... ATL HO, ATL HO), and my San Fran 49ers. Which leads me to my next subject, the wonderful 49ers/ Giants game. It was one of the most exciting and tension filled football games i've ever witnessed, not to mention the second biggest comeback in playoff history. It was a tough one for my Niners, but in the end it came down to Jeff Garcia and Terrell Owens showin all those motherfuckers how it's done. Even if they lose and go home empty handed next week(a good possibility considering they're playing Tampa Bay), I'll be happy with that one game, it was that good.  Alright my freaks, that's about it. I'm still too tired to think of anything else, but I know i'm forgetting something. Oh yeah, my sister just got back from England. She told me all about it, she has some funny ass stories dudes, and now because of her i'll always think of England as one messed up place. I will end this with a brilliant joke brought to you by Jesseca's dad: *he lets out a rip-roarin fart*, "Oh my god, did you hear what that asshole just said?"

      My mood has skyrocketed from my last post, which was only 40 minutes ago, but it was still a different day. I have that song "I'm With You" by Avril Lavigne stuck in my head, it's such a great song, I love it. I've listened to it about 5 times in a row now. There's nobody online this late, well there's a lot of people on, but they're just the usual suspects, no real standouts here my friends. I would actually like to talk to Shannon right now, that would be pretty interesting. I have a few things to say, and she's on, but there's the whole fued thing going on between us. I don't even know what the hell that is all about, I just remember that I told myself that I don't like her, but I don't remember why. I should probably just give it up and talk to her, but I'm too stubborn to do that. Oh well, maybe someday... All of that was improvised, and it veered me away from my original plan to post this thing that I read that cracked me up. But never fear, Dave Man is here, and he has brought you the humorous material. So without further adeui(what a weird fuckin word), I present it:  my mom: hey erin... me: yea my mom: how do u catch a unique rabbit? me:uh..i dunno. my mom: UNIQUE up on it. me: you're funny. my mom: hey erin.... me: yes dear... my mom: how do you catch a tame rabbit? me: uh..i dunno.... my mom: tame way, unique up on it... me: you are outta control. my mom: hey erin.... me: unique up on it.... my mom: uh, no. what does a fish say when it hits a cement wall? me: i dunno.... my mom: dam. me: you're funny mommy.  Wahahahahahahahaha!!! That is comedy! I got that off this chick's journal/ webcam thingy. Oh man she  is  outta control, lol. So funny...

      I didn't do anything useful today. I woke up at 3, called Jesseca, she said she would call me back. So I fooled around for about an hour until she called. Then I got mad when she said I couldn't come over, clammed up, and got off the phone shortly after. I layed down on my bed for a couple hours deciding whether or not to bash my cd player and cd holder with my new bat. Ultimately I decided I would save that for a time when I had a better reason. I got online at like 6 (I think) and I thought I had cooled off, but I ended up wiggin out and having to get off before I started bitching at Jesseca, something I didn't want to do because I would only do it out of anger. I tried to think of something to do that would cheer me up but I ended up just sitting and thinking about it for like an hour. Then a movie came on Lifetime (it just happened to be on that channel), so naturally I watched it. It seemed dumb at first, but then it got really good, and then it winded back down again to the ending, which sucked. Oh well though, that took my mind off of things for a couple hours. I went in my room and passed out after that. I woke up at 11 something facing the wrong way with my head aching, wishing I would have slept through to the morning. But no such luck, because here I am, wide awake on the computer typing this journal. My day was far from perfect, but it's almost over now so that's good, things can only get better whenever they're this bad. I just hope I didn't piss Jesseca off too much, because I was never mad at her, but I may have made it seem like I was, and that's what I'm worried about...For now I'm just gonna try and burn a couple CDs so my day wasn't completely unproductive, and I should probably get to sleep fairly early(I'm shootin for 3am) so I don't wake up extremely late again. So that's my day, it was pretty gay, but hey, I coulda been shovelin hay.

      Oh my god, did you hear that Mr. Rogers died? That sucks! He was awesome, I watched that show all the time. But if you think about it it's not that big of a surprise, considering the guy was already like 86 years old when I was in kindergarten... Rest In Peace Mr. Rogers, and have fun singing "Won't you be my neighbor"... IN HELL!   In other news, I have managed to write in my blog every day of this week. This marks the first time I have ever accomplished such a feat. It wasn't that big of a thing though since they were mostly short ones, but still, it's kind of cool. I just got my grade print-out for Business Computer Programming 1(coincidentally the class that i'm in right now) and it turns out that  I have a whopping 34 missing assignments  a.k.a. thirty four zeros. There must be some sort of mistake! I'm gonna go complain to her right this instant!

      You see, I have this little problem... I recieved a note a little while ago from the administration of Seabreeze High School telling me to go to the office for - well i'll just type up what the note actually says since it's a formal type thing anyway. Here's a transcript of the message:  Your presence is requested for registration for the 2003/2004 school year.  Please come  prepared  at the time specified above to the guidance office. Remember to  bring your Program of Studies with your chosen electives .  There are a multitude of problems with this request... 1) The time I was supposed to come is 10:15 and it is now 10:16 and counting. 2) I don't know where the guidance office is. 3) It specifically says to come  prepared  and  prepared  I definitely am not. 4) I don't have my Program of Studies with me, and even if I did, it is littered with obscene and profane drawings and other random forms of graffiti. 5) I have not chosen my electives, and I have no idea what ones I want to take. 6) I don't know what the hell they are talking about.  So i'm not going anywhere.

      Don't you think it's about time for an extremely long journal like entry to this beast? I do, it's been long enough. The question is - when will it come, tomorrow perhaps? Only time will tell. Until then I will be in my room meditating while listening to We Thuggin (Weezer).

      What's this? We have work to do? Ah man for a while there I thought it was a free day. Wait a minute, I don't do my work anyway...  There was another crazy note exchange between myself and Louis Garafolo today. I currently have the note in my possession, so I'm gonna take a page out of the "Fro Cat" book and put it on here for all to read. Now watch as Louie does the same thing and makes us both look bad for posting the same thing:   Louie wrote this:   Dear David,           On this day (May(5) 9th, 2020) [5/9/20], I bequief my Justin, my John ligament, and a foot... to you. I hope you decide to take action (wack-off) to forego my actions. If you have a problem with this, call my dad "Daner" and Justin will recede from Gettysburg.           Yours Truleyly (Fro brisketssss is the pronunciation)          Arnold B. Funkified  P.s. I wrote it in "English" this time  Alek Parker    I wrote the following back to the bastard:   My Dearest Dink,          Send my regards to Daina Beninati (Daner's sister). I accept the queif and in return I will bequeath my nigger upon you. Your mom still owes me ten dollars from last night [because I am a male hooker], so be sure to tell her. Lastly, unleash hell onto your inner nipple.          With pee in a bag,           Mr. Pink  P.S. "The shit has officially hit the fan" - Quoteth  Paul Orndorff   Pretty funny stuff huh? Well maybe not considering there are a lot of inside jokes, and some craziness that nobody can or should understand besides us... Nevertheless my new favorite band is  Queer As Folk .

      I have joined the Habitat for Humanity club, it's awesome. I started hanging out with those guys only yesterday and I have learned so much already that it blows my mind! Habitat for Humanity rocks! They have influenced me in a positive way and now I want to get my life back on track. I'm gonna start going to church every Sunday and Wednesday to pay back my debts to the lord. I have even decided to dedicate myself to abstinence, and I am not going to have sex until i'm married. I also refuse to use curse words or masturbate from here on out because they are sins and I will go to hell for doing them. Don't try to sway me on any of these things, I have already made up my mind and you won't be able to change that.  I just read Louie's blog. Nothing new, but it's funny/ crazy enough to read again. I like the direction he's taking with it, some crazy ass shit. I dig.  I've got the 'use hoody to hide the fact that i'm wearing headphones' thing goin on, it works quite well. It's funny as hell because I have to turn a full 180 degrees to see behind me(due to the hoody blocking my peripheral vision). So i'm spinning around in my chair every two seconds to see if the teacher is coming. I'm scared she's gonna wig out on me for not doing my work. If that happened I would be so screwed, not to mention confused. I don't know what the hell is going on right now because all i've been doin is listenin to da music. I'm kind of dissapointed that I forgot my cd case at home because it had some more cds that I could listen to. As it is i'm stuck listening to Sublime all day. That's not so bad though, because Sublime rocks the shit out of Justin on a cold Sunday afternoon.  This listening to music during school has got to be the coolest thing ever done. You can ignore your teachers and have fun at the same time. It has replaced sleep as the #1 in school time waster. I don't know about anybody else, but  I liked it .  Lovin is what I got Lovin, is what I got Lovin, is what I got, I said remember that  Before I go I must admit that the stuff in the first paragraph of this post is pure bullshit (as if it weren't obvious). I don't even know what the hell Habitat for Humanity is. I think Chris said something about joining it and I thought it had a funny name. But anyways, the whole thing was an attempt to be funny. I'm guessin it didn't work. I'll tell you what though, this kid that sits two seats down from me looks exactly like Jesseca's dad. My question is, why isn't he farting and asking me "Did you hear what that asshole just said?"

      I wish I wrote this song, because it describes my situation perfectly right now. Well almost perfectly. The only problem is I don't smoke and my mom doesn't tell me to do anything. Besides that, I can relate.  Sit around and watch the tube, but nothing's on. Change the channels for an hour or two. Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit, I'm sick of all the same old shit. In a house with unlocked doors, and I'm fucking lazy...  Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise. I'm so damn bored I'm going blind, and I smell like shit...  Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving, I sure as hell can't do it by myself. I'm feeling like a dog in heat, barred indoors from the summer street. I locked the door to my own cell, and I lost the key...  I got no motivation. Where is my motivation? No time for motivation. Smoking my inspiration.  Sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling. Call me pathetic, call me what you will. My mother says to get a job, but she don't like the one SHE'S got. When masturbation's lost its fun you're fucking breaking...  Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise. I'm so damn BORED i'm going blind, and loneliness has to suffice. Bite my lip and close my eyes, slipping away to Paradise. Some say, "Quit or I'll go blind", but It's just a myth...  -Green Day: Long View

      Chris and I went to some crazy party in New Symrna last night. I don't really know what to say about it, besides that it was the craziest night of my life.  I have also came to the conclusion that  Jesseca is the best kisser in the world, hands down . I am not even exaggerating here, she amazes me every time. I love it, and I love her.

      I was gonna write a really long post yesterday, but then I fell asleep... Don't feel bad though, I didn't do my homework either.  Today is Friday and I am happier than Steven Seagal in the kitchen of a cruise ship. I have a couple options of things to do tonight, and that's the way I like it. I'm not sure what i'm going to do at the moment, but I do know that  I have a boner right now . I don't have one for any specific reason, it's just one of those times. This sort of thing happens a lot.  I once heard a guy say "I get a hard-on when the wind blows." I feel sorry for that guy.

       If all else fails write Fro Briskets 5, 7, 8, 9, 20 times on a log of shit.   Louie just gave me some crazy note during the tornado drill. It was written in cursive, and I can't read that form of writing (as far as i'm concerned it isn't English), so i'm not sure what the note said. The only thing I could decipher was the last line, and what you see above this paragraph is what it said. Judging by the contents of this line I can guess that the whole thing was crazy as fuck and most likely funny as hell. It's ok though, I cracked up when I first read that. The log of shit part gets me everytime.  Yeah, so I walked home from school yesterday. During lunch I asked if anyone if they could give me a ride and they all said no so I was like "alright i'm leavin" and left. It was actually kind of hard to get off campus since they have that gate closed in the front now, but I just went out the back towards The Olive Garden and all that. It was a pretty long walk and I only got lost once, so it was cool. I actually had fun while walking home. I kept finding quarters and dimes in the road, messing around with dogs that barked at me (there must have been like 500 of em near beachside), and sneaking past people who were mowing/ watering their lawns. Whenever I got to the bridge I was like "oh yeaaaa" because the river looked really nice to my eyes for some reason, maybe I was sick of seeing all those bastard dogs and crazy houses. I sat down at that park under the bridge for a little while and overheard some girls talking about Joe Millionaire, that show by the way didn't surprise me because I already guessed the ending. Checking out the river I realized I could easily swim across it, so one of these days i'm gonna have to do that on film. After that I went over the bridge and picked up the pace from that point on. Don't ever let anyone tell ya that walking the Granada bridge is hard, because I did it without even breathing hard, with a backpack on. While I was going up, some crazy Jamaican nigger with dreds came flying past me on a bike. I gave him the nod and he nodded back, but he looked all scared and I laughed forever. The other side of the bridge didn't seem as far as the previous, although in reality it was probably farther. Not paying attention to much, just thinking about random stuff, I got home pretty quickly. Before I knew it I was home and I explained the situation to everyone, and they didn't really care, so it was sweet, and I am smooth.  Now, who are these motherfuckers that keep messing with Jesseca and asking for her number and all that kind of shit. I heard they touch her and hit her and flirt with her and basically act like idiots. Who are these kooks and what is their problem? Do they not know how to treat girls or are they just a bunch of fagets? Nobody I know ever touches girls or anything like that, because I don't hang out with assholes. I probably can't say that because there are exceptions, like Dan. Most of the time though, that is a very niggerish thing to do, the only people I see touching or hitting girls is black trash. So I conclude that anyone who does this is a nigger, plain and simple. I might even be able to see this if she was single, but she's not, obviously. So I have one thing to say to these queers: GET YOUR OWN...SUCKAAAAAAAAAA. I know they wouldn't try any of this crap if I was around either, so why do they do it when i'm not? Because they're pussies, and if they ever try anything around me, I don't care how many of them there are, they will die. I'm probably making it sound like I care way more than I really do. It doesn't even bother me much at all, because I know they are a bunch of fags.  Oh man these kids are arguing over the funniness of the chinese rap in CKY and its crackin me up. The conversation is going like this That shit aint funny and hes like You must be thinking of something else, because this shit is funny as fuckin shit dawg. He talks about slapping you in your shit with his little ass dick, now tell me that isnt funny  That sounds gay to me dawg  No way motherfucker, its funny as fuck that CKY is, he talks about soy sauce and rice and shit whoooooooooooo these kids are too much for me.  It's already Wednesday but this week still seems like it's going to take forever to end. That's fine, but  no more school for me please . The good news is it's probably just me going crazy and it will go by faster than I think. That's what my grandma always says anyhow, and she would know. In the meantime somebody should really buy me the Labrynth DVD. I've wanted it so bad for a long time, but I just haven't bought it yet. I think that's because it sold out at Wal-Mart a while back and I couldn't find it anywhere else (not that I looked). So if anyone finds it for 10 - 15 bucks and buys it for me I will give them something cool. Reimbursement in money for most, hot sex for Jesseca.

      What a messed up day it is today. After all, it is the first day of school after a four day weekend, so that's to be expected...  Everything's going normal right, I wake up and get ready for school as usual. Except today i'm not tired in the least, so it's even better than most days. Since i'm up and going before schedule I have time to eat breakfast, which of course is pizza and soda. I get to school early, and I have plenty of time to get to class, now  that  is a miracle. I get out of the car and start walking to first block when I hear my dad yell my name from back inside the truck..."oh shit" I think, "what's wrong?" My dad then informs me that i've forgotten my backpack. I was relieved, that is no big deal. So I look around the truck and my backpack is nowhere to be found, I laugh and tell him that I left it at home. He laughs in return, but it's more of a forced one. I get in the truck expecting to have to go all the way back home to get my backpack, but my dad says otherwise. He tells me to just go to class and he'll bring it in a few minutes. It was kind of a weird suggestion, but it made no difference to me. Either way I was doing no work, so I was just like alright. It crossed my mind that he might have a hard time finding my backpack, but I dismissed it as a small problem. I was right, if only for a second.  I get to class and basically just sit there for the first thirty minutes, pretending to do my work. And if you're anything like me, you know that acting like you're doing your work is a very funny/ crazy thing to do. I've never gotten caught doing this, but if you did what would you say? "Uhhh, i'm just moving my hand across my paper as if I was writing something with a pencil, but nothing is actually being written because I have no pencil." According to my calculations, I believe that would make you about a 900 out of 55 on the kook scale. During my time without my backpack, I realized how much I take having the right materials for school for granted. You never fully appreciate a pencil or a piece of paper until you don't have one. This is reminiscent of the 1980's rock hit "You don't know what you got, till it's gone" by the great hair band  Cinderella . After about a half an hour of doubtful waiting, that seemed like forever, some crazy lookin lady walks in carrying my backpack. I don't even have time to celebrate before I realize that my dad has brought me the wrong backpack. This lady was carrying my Magic backpack. At this time, it felt like I had just entered the craziest, most awkward situation ever. So now I have a bunch of Magic cards...not really what I needed, but thanks. Does anyone else feel sorry for my dad, because I do. The poor guy had to deal with my bullshit and go all the way back to our house to retrieve my backpack, he still has to go to work mind you. Then he picks up the wrong one and brings me my Magic cards. That really sucks. He's lucky i'm not an asshole, or I might bitch him out for bringing me the wrong thing. Enough about my dad though, i'm the one that's screwed here. On top of having a backpack full of Magic cards and the fact that I don't like to admit that I play Magic, I just found a knife in the front pocket of my backpack, greaaaaaaaat. Besides that potential mess of trouble, what am I supposed to do the rest of the day without my stuff? Nothing? For the rest of this class I guess i'm just gonna sit here and do just that. Beyond that though, there are two possibilities. I am either getting a ride home from Louie or Zac, or i'm walking home. I'm leaning more towards walking home. Not only because it's likely that no one will want to drive me that far, but also because it will be fun. I didn't want to go to school today anyway, and now I can just play some games or something.  There is one thing that is tempting me to come back to school after I go home: I am wearing a crazy/ cool outfit today and I want to show it off. I have on my usual O' Niell sweater on, which is always cool. Then I have these green punkerish jeans on that I think are pretty cool but I never wear. I also have a white shirt on underneath my sweater, but I consider that a small detail since I don't plan on taking my sweater off anytime soon. I have this little heart bracelet on my wrist that I stole from my sister's friend. That's obviously one of the funnier things about my ensemble, and I wanted to see what people said to this girliness/gayness. The funniest thing of all, perhaps, is the chain wallet that hangs from my belt buckle and rests in my side pocket. I haven't worn one of these since like fourth grade, and to tell the truth it feels kind of cool. This is probably due to the fact that nobody wears these anymore besides crazy punkers, and I like doing things that nobody else does. The wallet is pretty funny too, it's one of those three fold ones and my money barely fits in it so it's all fat and I laugh. Plus nothing beats the combination of chains and leather(in case I didn't mention it before, the wallet is leather).  Now the random ass fucker busts in with his two cents:  "ACTUALLY EVERYTHING BEATS THE COMBINATION OF CHAINS AND LEATHER YOU FAGET BITCH!!!!!!!"

      I love it how I can go to 2nd block anytime I like. You can come in here an hour and ten minutes late and Mrs. Parlade won't say a word to ya. It's crazy. You would think there was some sort of restrictions or rules regarding tardiness, but apparently the school only cares when you're late for 1st or 3rd block. That's only because that's the beginning of school and lunch, any other time they don't do anything to you if you're late. To me that's obsurd, but also very cool.  I know some people who won't take shits in public bathrooms, at gas stations, at school, or at other people's houses. I don't see what the big deal is. I'll poop anywhere, or pee anywhere for that matter, as my friends know. Of course there's always the chance that you clog up the toilet at someone else's house, but that would be hilarious. In that case I would do two things - laugh at the fools who have to clean up that overflowing mess, and leave the house immediately, out the window if necessary. Some people are scared to sit on the seat, even when it has nothing on it. I can see if there's some shit or piss, I wouldn't sit down either. But in public restrooms, whether it be at 7-11, some random ran-down gas station, or school I don't see why it matters to anyone if there's nothing visible on the seat. I could care less if there's some germs getting on my butt and bottom of my upper legs region, that's a shoe in already. And so what if you run the risk of getting aids while sitting on the public John? I already have a backup plan for that...  ...It's real simple: I get aids, no matter what the source, and I go on a massive killing spree. I will get ahold of a rocket launcher, a couple machine guns, some grenades, and a bomb or some anthrax or something because if I have aids and i'm gonna die, i'm gonna take at least 200 of you motherfuckers down with me. First i'd launch a missile straight into one of those stupid Arab stores, I have always hated those guys anyways. After that I would go to the ghetto and shoot up a bunch of niggers, as many as possible. Forcibly entering houses is an option if the situation calls for it. The method to my madness being to avenge my grandfather, who was attacked by a bunch of nigs at the beach in his early twenties. The attack fucked him up mentally for the rest of his life and now he's an asshole to everyone. So if given the chance to get the blackies back, I would take it. Then I would steal a car from someone at gunpoint, drive over to Brain Beard's, and throw a grenade into his house, blowing it to shreds. Why you ask? Well his name is Brain Beard... The showdown would last a little longer as I hide in the cargo area of a commercial jetliner, guns and all, on my trip to New York (or wherever China Town is). You don't think I would be able to pull that off? Well I probably couldn't, but in this story, anything goes. Upon my entry into China Town I would kick it up a notch and just start shooting everyone in sight, since they're all chinks anyway, it wouldn't matter. Grenades would be thrown, guns would be slanged, and the missiles from my "launcha" would be eagerly trying to catch up to every mass of running people, and suceeding. It would all end with a Matrix style battle/shootout with the police, there would be hundreds of them, and I would be doing cartwheels across the barrier of cars, machine guns blazin. After I took out the initial 100 or so officers there would be a reinforcement of about 300, plus the National Guard, plus the Army. The battle would rage on for about 10 more minutes as I mowed down all those pigs. Eventually I would get sniped by a rooftop sharpshooter and fall to the ground, not getting killed instantly. As everyone approached me to see if I was dead I would say "I don't care, I have aids anyways you fags" in a clear voice so all could hear. I would then open my hand to reveal a live grenade, with the clip off, and before they could run it would blow everyone, including myself, 10 feet into the air... Just like in  The Professional .  You will notice the gratuitous violence involved in my little story, that is because I have been watching ultraviolent, Rated R movies since a very young age. By this time I am desensitized to violence, so I can't help it. Also, if you thought that last paragraph was "horribly racist" or "ignorant" or something of that nature, you must realize that I am only joking, and it's all in fun. So chill out, fool.  ...

      Hey Jesseca, read the bold shit from left to right for a special message... [and oh yes, I know every single person that reads this is going to read what the bold font says. even when i only gave Jesseca permission to do so, assholes...]  Oh my god I miss Jesseca... I  don't know why, but all day I have had an extreme longing to be  w ith, or see, or t a lk to her. It was n 't so bad un t il recently, but it's really strong like right now, and  y es it sucks. I really wish I c o uld see her tommorow, since it's Valentines Day and all, b u t I won't get my hopes up on that one. She's g r ounded, I know,  b ut her m o m  has  to make an exception tommorow, right?  D   on't count out the possibility. Ma y be I can go over there or something. I don't know, it's kind of a pipe dream, but I sure hope so.  I have a little perdicament here. I have been reading a bunch of awesome blogs for the last hour or so, and they were really funny, revealing, and most of all, inspiring. So after reading all this i'm feeling very inspired and want to write something. Something long, engaging, funny and fun. The problem is it's really late and I still have to take a shower, and I have to go to bed sometime because I have school tommorow. I need to choose whether to stay up and write, or go to bed and be awake for school tommorow. My first idea is to just say to hell with school and stay up, something I normally wouldn't do (well actually I probably would, but you know what I mean), but since it's Friday tommorow I don't think it matters whether i'm awake in class or not. I think that's kind of fucked up though because I should probably be trying to do good tommorow in order to have some padding for when I don't do shit next week. In the end I don't think this decision will matter much in the grand scheme of things, and my mind has wandered off to thoughts of Jesseca again, making me lose my place in my thought process that was helping me decipher what the hell I was talking about, so i'm done talking about this shit.  I want a digital camera more than anyone. I think it would be so freakin badass to have one, I can't even start to explain how much fun I would have with it. Maybe I am just an egomaniac, but I love taking pictures of myself. The fun doesn't stop with snapshots of me, I can also take pictures of everyone, and everything, else. Did I mention that digital cameras give you the ability to look at the pictures like you would on a computer monitor, arrange them however you like, delete the bad ones, organize them to your liking, and bring them up on your computer and put them on the internet or show your friends. That is so awesome man, I envy everyone who has one of these things. If anyone were to buy me one of these I would be overjoyed and that would be the coolest thing anyone has done for me, ever (well maybe not but i'm trying to be enthusiastic here). So come on my friends and help me out, buy me a digital camera for no reason, you will go to heaven for it. If anyone seriously does this it better be a Sony or I will yell at you, because I am really picky about that sort of thing. Mainly because that's the only kind that will plug into my computer, you know how that goes...  Man I don't have much else to say, I tried pretty hard to write something cool but i'm sorry i'm just like zoned out and stuff. There was this really cool analogy that I was gonna put on here. The best and most creative analogy i've ever heard in my life actually, so it sucks that it kind of went with a picture, and I can't put pictures on this shit. Did I mention that I didn't do a bunch of homework that I was supposed to do tonight? Well yeah it's true... and that's too bad because i'm going to sleep now.

      No hat + No gel + Shower in the morning without brushing hair afterwards = I HAVE CRAZY ASS HAIR. Add to that the fact that I haven't shaved in like 2 weeks and you will realize that I look pretty crazy right now. Luckily I was able to solve my hair problem by flattening it down with the hood of my sweater (oh the genius). I'm actually in a good mood today, I suppose it's because I feel much more awake than usual. Pretty cool huh?  I have this song on my mind and I think the only way to get it off would be to sing every word I know(or think I know), let me see if it works:  You remind me of the babe. What babe? The babe with the power. What power? The power of voodoo. You do. Do what? You remind me of the babe...I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry. What could I do? My baby's love had gone and made my baby blue, nobody knew! What kind of magic spell to use? Slime and snails. And puppy dog tails! Thunder and lightning. And baby says... Dance Magic Dance! Dance Magic Dance! Dance Magic Dance! Put that magic spell on me, touch that baby make him scream!  That's from Labrynth and i'm sorry for cutting it off but by that point in the movie i'm usually in tears from laughing so hard. It is without a doubt, the craziest scene in any movie ever. Complete with David Bowie dancing around in tight ass spandex-ish pants in a sucessful attempt to show off his dong to the world. Oh my god it cracks me up just thinking about it.  I can't believe it's already Thursday. Tommorow is gonna be Friday, and also Valentines Day, but after that we have Monday off (yes!). So it's gonna be a three day weekend, and we all know there's plenty of fun to be had in a three day weekend. It should be the shiznit, my niggers. I'm not really looking forward to Valentines Day because it's just a big scam that store owners made up so we would have another reason to spend money on their products. I don't really care though, since i'm not one of those crazy political minded anarchists. The bigger problem is Jesseca is grounded so there is a 95% chance I won't even see her tommorow. In any case, i'm not sure if I should buy her something...I guess I should because it's better to be safe then sorry, but then again it's not that big of a deal. So we will see, but chances are I won't buy anything, not that it matters. And Jesseca, if you're reading this -  I Love You .  Yesterday when we were at the card shop Louie brought up a good point. He told me that we could easily beat the crap out of any one of the fags in there. I had never really thought about it that way, but he's right. I looked around and saw a bunch of extreme geeks who were either skinny as shit or fat as fuck. After sizing them up I realized that none of them, with no exceptions, could stand a chance against either of us. I was certain of this after I shook some of their hands (ya know, the post-game ritual), they shake hands like the biggest pussies ever. I want to say they do it like a girl but it's worse than that. Every one of em had really skinny fingers and thin ass hands, they were really soft and delicate, and they barely even touched my hand. I felt like I was shaking hands with my grandma. If we really wanted to we could just beat them down and steal their cards... but that's no fun. So if it ever comes down to it, we could kick  allllllll  their asses, and that is a reassuring thought.  Joe Millionaire was on Monday, and if you saw it you would know that they've been touting this surprising twist at the end as something spectacular and unexpected. For the uninformed, i'm not talking about him telling the girl he's isn't a millionaire, there's something else. Well I think I know what the surprise is going to be, and i'm so confident about this that I would probably bet on it. I think that after he tells the girl he's not a millionaire, and after she cries and all that, whether she says she still wants to be with him or not, the producers of the show are gonna give him a million dollars for real. That will be the twist at the end. This makes sense on so many levels...If you really think about it, the ending would be kind of dull if he just told the girl he wasn't a millionaire, but now that they give him money and make it so he really is a millionaire it will be a happy ending and it will all be good. The only thing i'm not sure of is how much money they will give him, but I don't think it makes any difference, most likely it will be either 1 million or 50 million, but the latter would surprise me. As far as my pick for the girl, i'm pretty sure he's gonna pick Sarah, but you never know. We'll see how it pans out next Monday, the finale is gonna be awesome, and you know the ratings are gonna be through the roof.  You wanna hear a joke? Business Computer Programming I. I hate this class, it is seriously a joke. It stinks like fuckin tar up in herre, supposedly because they're tarring the roof and we have a open vent coming to the room, but I personally blame it on this haggard old man that is tampering with the computer next to me. That's to my left, now to my right we have an ugly ass neanderthal-lookin red haired kook motherfucker who is addicted to Harry Potter. Don't get me wrong, i'm a fan of the books as well (the new one comes out in June baby), but I don't spend my free time surfing the Harry Potter website and chatting in the Harry Potter themed message boards. So let's recap. I have an old geezer to my left, Readhead McUgly to my right, and it smells like King Kong took a shit in our ventilation system. Having fun yet? On top of that there is a drink next to me that is still cold, but I have no idea who it belongs to, and i'm thinkin "what the fuck, why is there a drink next to me?" Then there's the kid who plays the same Red Hot Chili Peppers song non-stop(literally) all fucking day. He plays it so loud too, and the funny thing is the teacher has told him every day this year to get headphones but he never does, he's such an ignorant asshole. I don't even know which kid it is, or else I would have broken the speaker over his head by now. All I know is it comes from the top left portion of the classroom and it is very, very annoying. I used to like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but now I don't think i'll ever willingly listen to them again, i'm scarred for life. I don't even understand what we're supposed to do in this class, she never really explained it to me, so whenever she's like "use the print using statement to find the variable of the read data loop", i'm like "uhhhh no." And if this bitch next to me puts her book on my mouse cord (effectively not letting me move my mouse) one more time i'm going to shove it up her ass. Ahhh what I wanna know is...What have I gotten myself into!?!?!?  In case you haven't heard, I have turned into a Buddhist missionary. So  PRAISE BUDDHA ...Nah just kiddin. But for this I kid you not: fat people sweat when they walk. I often stop and laugh at fat people's tendency to sweat on a cold day when they are walking at a slow pace. It is quite humorous, you should check it out sometime. As for the question of "Who's up, who's down?", I dunno. I'm leavin.  [...that was definitely not a cool ending...]

      I know that I should be the sleeping... but there is an event that calls for recognition. Every dog has his day, or so they say, and today was Alan's day (2/10/2003!). After a long hiatus he returns and reigns victorious. This event will go down in history, in my mind anyways. Long live king Alan.

      What the hell is going on around here? The answer nobody knows. Well maybe somebody does, but I sure don't. This weekend was alright until today. There was some football, a little basketball, and a ton of Magic played. That was all yesterday and the day before however, and today, in stark contrast, nothing has gotten done. I have been sitting around my house doing literally nothing. Not eating, not watching tv, not reading, not playing games, and barely thinking, just sitting around here. I feel like I can't come up with anything creative or clever right now. I am probably just tired, if my experience in these matters has taught me anything. The problem is I don't feel tired, I don't want to go to sleep, and I want a diversion. I've been trying to listen various types of music and nothing sounds good. I've tried to read stuff on the computer, but that proved to be very boring. I've tried to talk to people online as well, but nobody really has anything to say. Well not positive things anyway. The only other things that I can think of are 1)try to find something good on tv and 2) try to play some video games or 3)try to watch a movie. The first thing is pretty much impossible since my cable is unhooked in my room and the living room tv is being occupied by the rest of my family. The second idea just might work, but the only thing I can play is Shenmue II since the only system that's hooked up is my X-Box. So if Shenmue II gets boring fast then i'm screwed. My third option seems like the best of the three, if I can find the right movie to watch. I'm not sure what kind of movie I want to see. Whether it is a nostalgic movie that makes me think of the past, a fantasy that makes me think about it's world, or a comedy that just makes me laugh, it has to be something that engrosses me into the movie and lets me escape from reality, even if it's just for an hour or two. If a movie happened to do this that would be great, then I could go to bed a satisfied man.  That's about it for today. There's not much to it, but you must understand it is a sunday, the worst day of the week. It was a gloomy and rainy sunday at that. My closing thoughts are about Jesseca telling me she's been grounded for two weeks...I won't actually explain my thoughts but I will say that i'm worried about the implications.

      So much to say and so little time to say it in. That's the story of my journal as of right now. I have been busy with schoolwork and videogames for a few days now. I don't even have time to sleep, so you can imagine how much time I have to write in this, not much. That said, it should be known that I am biting a chunk out of my precious Shenmue II playing time to bring you this very special edition of  Jareth's Little Ball That He Throws Crazily . The main reason I am doing this is not so much that I want to appease my loyal fans who have been dissapointed by my lack of interesting updates these past couple days. It is more a matter of needing to get some stuff off my chest.  The first thing I must adress, since it has been bothering me for four days now, is the crashing and burning of the space shuttle Columbia. It seems like everyone in the world and every news channel on tv is wigging out about this. I guess they have a good reason, NASA probably spent (and lost) a ton of money on this mission, and of course, seven astronauts lost their lives in this "tragedy". To me however, this was not a big deal AT ALL. I'm puzzled as to why normal people care even a smidgen about these astronauts, I sure as hell don't care about them, and why should I? I don't know them, nobody that I know knows them, so why should I care about them? To me they are nothing. People die all the time, millions every day, and nobody says anything about them. Dying sucks, yes, but it happens to  everyone .  So I refuse to say anything about these astronauts deaths as if they were more special than anyone else. Another thing- astronauts are dumb for going into space in the first place, it is an extremely dangerous thing to do, but they want to be the big heroes, well we all see where that got 'em. Some people just don't get the big picture. There is nothing cool in space, so what do they expect when they go up there? It's cold as fuck, there's no oxygen (which is required to sustain human life, in case these kooks didn't know), and there is nothing there, just a bunch of sattelites. Wow! Isn't space fun?! Umm, not exactly.  I'll take a break from my ranting for a moment to talk about how school's going. It's kind of funny how the situation is developing. Instead of doing bad in math, like I was last time, i'm doing freaking abysmal in computers. I have so many zeros in there i'm too scared to count, and every day it gets worse because she assigns us like five things a day and I do maybe one of them, if i'm in the mood. I know what i'm getting in there on my interim...a big fat F. Ouch. Nevertheless, there is some good news to this dreary story. In my other three classes Algebra 2, English 2, and Spanish 1 I am doing great. I have a solid B+ in English, and every day it moves closer to an A. I have either a high B or low A in Spanish, which is awesome. In math I am even doing good, unlike the previous two semesters this year (last year I got 2 A's), so that is a great feeling. The cool thing about all of this is I am actually starting to enjoy school now that i've been doing my homework every time it is assigned and getting good grades. I sometimes look forward to school as well, which has always been a rare occurance throughout my educational career. Peachy.  The subject of my weekend has been avoided thus far but will no longer be able to escape my storytelling clutches. I don't know what to tell ya, besides this one was a weird one folks. It was so far out that at one point I seriously thought I was dreaming, but that might have beeen my psychosis acting up again. In any case, I had some considerable fun this weekend and I kept the boredom to a minimum. On friday night Chris and Louie came by my house unexpectedly, and a little later we made a surprise appearance at, of all places, the card shop. It was really crazy and cool at the same time to be back there, mindblowing really. Practically everyone that I remember from the card shop when it moved a couple years ago was there friday, that really surprised me. The coolest thing of all is that Twitch now runs the joint. He has always been one of the coolest guys there and one that was always nice and helpful to Chris and I even though we didn't quite fit in with the regulars. It is awesome to have the cardshop back in business right near us, and even better is the fact that there is a tournament nearly every day of the week, not to mention for a cheaper price and bigger payoff. The Magic community seems to be bigger and stronger than ever too, as dorky as these people might be, that's nice to know. The coming of the card shop couldn't have came at a better time either, right when we start to get back into the game we are told that the cardshop just recently moved back near us, score. Since the new card shop not only lived up to my expectations but also exceeded them I look forward to going there and hangin with the old school geeks and beating their ass at a good old game of M:TG.   Back on focus, nothing big happened on this particular night, it was more of a time to get reaquainted with the whole experience. Since we missed the tournament Chris and I just played a couple games amongst ourselves and left. We got a ride home from his mom and almost directly after arriving at his house we left to go to Eric Leb's. We were going there to watch the Kings Vs. Lakers game. On the way there it was  really  foggy and we were trying to navigate ourselves through a long ass path through the trails. It was at this time when I began to feel like I was dreaming. For one I couldn't believe I had just been to the card shop and for two, I couldn't see shit, thus making it seem like a dream. Being at Eric's house for the first time in my life didn't help matters much. That was an odd experience, it was late at night and Chris was falling asleep, leaving me to fend for myself with Eric, whom I don't know very well at all. Luckily it wasn't that bad because Chris was talking in his sleep, saying crazy shit and making weird noises, so that made it very easy to communicate, and laugh, with the Lebmyster. We were scheduled to go back to Chris's that night (this is still friday people) to go to sleep, but since Chris had already been dozing off and probably wouldn't make it home in the dark, Eric let us stay at his house. This turned out to be a crazy situation in the morning, when we woke up in this foreign bedroom (we were in some guestroom, while Eric was in his), wondering where the hell we were. After sneaking around for a bit, ya know, to avoid the parentals, we found Eric downstairs and ate some breakfast. McDonalds for those who are wondering, that's what you get for breakfast when you make 10 billion dollars a year.   Later we went home and were dissapointed to find that nobody was living up to their plans to go to hurst and play the mighty dicathlon of sports. Eventually, at around four, we got everyone except for Zac up there to play. It wasn't quite as fun as I anticipated, but it would have sucked a whole lot worse if me and Louie hadn't beaten Chris and Mike at Grunge Match style football with a last minute fumble return for a touchdown. Oh Yeahhh!! Ok, so Chris's previously injured leg did wig out on the play, but that doesn't matter, because like Shaq once said "the only stat that counts is the W."  I admit it, I have omitted some rather integral parts of my weekend. Like the whole movies mishap, not mentioned whatsoever. And the part about Jocelyn and the whitey-blackey-lover-girl overhearing our devious plans(easily one of the more embarassing things I have ever been through), not included. However, I would consider these things minor, and not worth mentioning because they are either A) Boring or B) Too lengthy for my lazy ass to explain. The two very last major events that occured this weekend are the following: I purchased 3 DVDs(I was gonna get 5 DVDs but I had to put two of them back because they were rated R and Wal-Mart, being the blistering hemroids that they are, wouldn't let me buy them) and a game, and my tv blew up. My tv had been spazzing out, making loud noises and going blurry, every so often for about the last month. It reached its limit this weekend and just shut off, and wouldn't turn back on. My initial reaction was "oh well, i'll just get another one", but when my dad said I would have to wait at least 2 weeks to get a new one I took things into my own hands. I unplugged everything from the entertainment center, loosely organized the cords and controllers on my ground, and arranged a makeshift setup using my dresser as the tv stand. It works quite well, and now I can play games in comfort, on my bed. Where before I used to always have to sit in awkward positions and permanently jack up my spine. Oh yeah, in case you didn't catch it, I fixed my tv now and it's all good. Very cool.  Before I stop writing this overly long, rushed, dullness filled journal entry I figure I will make it longer and even more unbearable with a few more of my complaints...You know something that pisses me off? When people don't flush the toilet. At school or otherwise, this is unacceptable behavior, plain and simple. Why the hell would you not flush the toilet? Because you are a nasty ass bitch is why. I always find myself flushing 4 or 5 urinals a day when I see that the person before didn't flush it, this sickens me. I can't believe these disgusting assholes. This can definitely be considered a pet peeve of mine. So if you are one of the dirty, homo-erotic individuals who does this sort of thing you better not let me see you do it or I am gonna personally slam your head into the urinal and flush your gay ass down the drain. You have been warned.   The next group to stand up to the podium of shame are the people who wear board shorts to school, elementary kid lookalikes that go to my high school, and people with a lisp. Ahhh... you kooks who wear boardshorts (another name for the surfer style swimming trunks) to school, how I loathe thee. I will not insult and make fun of you in a lengthy manner, I will only point and laugh. For real though, what's is up with these dumbasses? It doesn't look cool to dress like this at school, it is not cool to be a surfer,  and this is not the beach . As for the young looking kids who populate the halls of Seabreeze High School whom I laugh ever so wildy at - what the fuck happened to you? I'm not even joking on this one, what is wrong with these bastards? I know preschoolers who look older than them. If you go to my school and have no idea what i'm talking about take one look at Joey Sorocco and you will see the light. Finally I come to people with a lisp, to these people I have nothing to say...besides that having a lisp is the most outrageously crazy and gay thing that can happen to a person, and I am so glad I don't have a speech impediment.  At this point I am feeling pretty uninspired, and with good reason, you wouldn't feel like writing anymore either after you finished typing six million words. Despite feeling very tired I know how much a good conclusion can help a journal, so I won't let ya down. I will end this with that excellent Louie joke that I mentioned in an entry about a week back, it goes a little somethin like this:  Louie: Hey my mom wants to know if you'll help her plant tulips sometime next week for a hundred bucks an hour. Random Girl: Really? A hundred bucks an hour? Wow! Yeah, i'll do it. Louie: Yeah it's cool ain't it, my mom's crazy like that. All you have to do is plant tulips. Random Girl: That's awesome, I can't wait. So when is it exactly? Louie: Umm next week sometime, i'll tell you the day tommorow or something, I have to ask her. Random Girl: (now exuberant with excitement and enthusiasm) Oh. That's really cool though! Louie: Yep, it's gonna be me, you, and my mom, it'll be fun. Random Girl: I know I know, and we're gonna make a hundred bucks an hour! Louie: Yep, so aren't you even gonna ask where you're doing this at? Random Girl: Where? Louie: Well...You're gonna plant tulips, but the only place you're plant two-lips is on my dick!!! (hardy har har)

      I've been waking up a very tired little boy lately. On sunday I stayed up until 1 o clock playing Shenmue II, getting about halfway through(i'm hopelessly addicted to this game). I think it was well worth it, even if I did wake up in the morning feeling like a lethargic lunatic. Last night was the same story, only a little worse. I got my new EGM magazine yesterday, and I read the whole thing, every word, in one day. It probably wasn't the smartest thing to do, considering that it kept me up until a little after 3 in the morning, but I simply couldn't put it down. At the end of the 10 hour (give or take a few) reading fest I still felt enthralled and I desperately wanted to read something else, or write a story, or play a game, but I was too damn tired to do anything of the sort. This morning I felt the worst I have felt in a long time after awakening from my slumber. In my early morning blur of exhaustion I denounced school and even called it  The Neverending Assault On The Well Being Of Millions Of Teenagers Across America  and  The Sleeping Man's Bane . I came up with vaguely philosophical questions and statements like "What the hell is school's problem, waking me up at 6:30 in the [fucking!] morning? If any person ever tried to wake me up at this time I would be like 'Hey asshole, turn off the light, i'm going back to sleep!' But school gets away with it every single day, now what is up with that?" Shortly afterwards my mom broke in with "Get up and get ready, it's 8:05 already", squandering my hopes of staying home from school. Although I had no specific reason of staying home, besides being tired, I was sorely dissapointed. It turned out for the better though, because now I am feeling wide awake, and I even had fun in 1st block. The old saying goes "mama knows best", and today, that saying was true.  We had to read our fellow classmates' essays in English today as a "peer review". Soon after doing this I realized that there is no end to human stupidity. Some of the shit(literally) that I read was so unbelievably idiotic that you would have to read it to believe it. It was insane! I don't understand how a person could be that dumb. It sounded like something a kindergartener would write. I have one question to ask Cliff Mitchell(the kid who not only wrote the worst essay I have ever read in my life but also the craziest looking motherfucker this side of the Mississippi). Where the hell were you the last nine years of English class!?!?  Much more is on the mind of brilliance that is my own, but I must go, for the bell has rung, signaling the end of class.

      Time for me to shoot straight from the hip, or something like that...  Oh no i'm feeling sick, this isn't good. My nose is running and i'm sneezing, but that's the extent of my sickness so far, which is a good thing. Tomorrow is April Fools Day, some girl already tried to trick me and I told her it wasn't time yet and she was like "fuck you", then I told her to tone down the language and she said "no", so I was like whatever. I have three things on my mind, the crapiness of school (it bothers me), my hunger to watch Donnie Darko (Chris took it home with him so I can't), and the absence of Jesseca from the online realm (she told me she would be on at 8 but she probably fell asleep and for that I don't blame her, I should be sleeping as well). Chris, however, only has one thing on his mind - his newest cd, aptly named "The Potato Famine", a title I thought of myself. What a crazy name for a cd, but it is fitting, for the cd is equally maniacal. If you listen to it you might just go stark raving mad. Not really, I just wanted to use the phrase "stark raving mad"...

      Damn it's cold out today. It's the kind of day that puts scientists to shame for talking about "Global warming" and "The green house effect." I would like you to explain this one, you brainiacs.  There's nothing interesting online today either, but somehow I keep myself busy. I want to go home and watch Donnie Darko one more time so I can fully understand it, or at least form my own opinions about what it's about, regardless if they're correct. I was going to do a mini review of 8 Mile, but that movie pales in comparison to the depth of Donnie Darko and its Sundance Film Festival artsyness. I guess I could still do it though, for those who care.   8 Mile  - **SPOILER ALERT** DONT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE AND DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN IT. After all the good things I heard about this movie, I didn't expect much. I spent the first ten minutes thinking it had been overhyped too much by Zac and my sister for me to enjoy it, but I eventually got into it. I liked the movie a lot immediately after it ended. I liked how it built up from the slow moving start to the excellent ending. Overall the movie was pretty good, especially the last free style battle scene, that was really the highlight of the film. After (and during) it I was on my feet because I was so excited about it. The things he says will make you go "yeah!", it's a very good scene. I do have a few complaints though. There were a lot of things in the plot that were never really wrapped up and some things that weren't handled well. You could blame that on the director though, I think he was a loser. I base that on the fact that there were no shots that impressed me all that much, and how the movie ended (i'm talking about the very end, when he walks down the alley back to work). The movie ended too soon if you ask me and left the storyline about his girlfriend and his mom and sister hanging. I also think they could have fleshed out his relationship with Brittany Murphy a lot more. It didn't even seem like they were together, or even hooked up at any time except for their one sex scene. I don't know if it was supposed to be like that or what, but if so then I don't know why he would be so mad when he caught the black dude with her... All in all, it could have been better, but I like it how it is anyway, mostly because of the final free style scene.

      There was some funny crap on G4TV last night. This guy's nickname was "Cheeks", and the host of the show was like "Why do they call you cheeks?", the guy's explanation was the following... "You know how you say something's tight? Well my friends and I always say 'How tight?' and we say 'Tight like butt cheeks' right? So I just shortened it to a more sexy form, cheeks."   Ahhhh what's with all these computer problems today? Somebody fucked up the internet on my computer (in school), they must have downloaded a virus or something. It will bring up the internet explorer craziness but it won't go to any websites except for the school one. In my short time spent here I haven't been able to figure out what's wrong. I will probably be able to get it working eventually, but right now it doesn't matter because i'm using this absent chick's comp. Her mouse is FUBAR though and it's starting to annoy me. So if it isn't fixed by Monday it's gonna suck a fatty.  I need to find a ride home early today because they're having a girls football game for the last two hours of school, and I don't have tickets (by choice). Plus I didn't finish all of my Spanish homework. I kinda want to go to Spanish though since we're having a donut party, so i'll probably go there and leave during break. If worst comes to worst i'll just walk home, because when it comes down to it -  I would rather go skimboarding in Alaska with Don King than go to a "Powder Puff" football game .  With that, i'm out like a cottage cheese assed old hag in a thong contest.

      Oh Jesseca, I know you're reading this. Your newest journal is the worst one of them all, and it didn't help the situation, at all. If anything it hardened my resolve to stop caring about your journal. You will never hear me say anything like that about girls, because I could care less about other girls' attractiveness. If you feel that way, that's fine, but i'm not reading your journal anymore. It offends me hardcore and does more bad than good. But again, it's nothing personal, and I still love ya.  Edit: I deleted this paragraph because it was stupid.  In other news: We are having a donut day in Spanish tomorrow. I'm considering it a competition this time, and I am taking it very seriously. Believe me when I say that  I WILL DEVOUR EVERY SINGLE DONUT IN THAT CLASSROOM!! HAHAHAHAHA!!!!  Actually, when it comes to eating, my eyes are bigger than my stomach. So I will probably end up eating like 2. Nothing's stopping me from drinking ten glasses of milk though, because I can drink with the best of em.

       Everything's funny to me man.   I've been surfing the "world wide web" all day, and among other things, I realized how obsurd of a nickname for the internet that really is. Whoever thought of that one better be shining his lucky penny every day and night, because i'm coming for him. Not really though, I just felt like talking about shining pennies, because it's a crazy thing to do... I read Ricky's blog, and his newest entry wasn't so great, but the one about knifing the bum cracked me up. Random spurts of violence get me everytime. Anti's blog was also pretty cool today. He revealed a bunch of personal stuff, as people tend to do when they're on drugs (and yes, he admitted he was on drugs), and I love when people reveal the personal craziness, whether they're doped up or not. So ya know, it was enjoyable for me. As for Jesseca's blog, I don't like reading that anymore because she always talks about other guys being hot and stuff. Even though she tells me not to take it personally, it still bothers me and it just isn't something I like to know about. So ya know, I refrain from reading that. It's nothing personal though, Jesseca. I can't really say something about other people's blogs because they never write anything in them. Oh how I hate it when people don't write in their blogs/ journals very often. Same thing goes for websites that don't update on an hourly basis. I guess you could file that as a pet peeve of mine... GET ON THE BALL YOU FRUITS!  I'm probably not gonna write in class tomorrow because i'm gonna be busy doing a bunch of work. After all, school goes by much faster when you're doing stuff, and I just want it to end. What does this mean to you? It means that I have to get some things out of my system so I won't be tempted to write about them tomorrow. First things first, you've had the Hot n' Spicy McChicken at McDonalds? That's good stuff. Second, you've heard the song Fame by David Bowie? That song kicks some ass. Third, well, there is no third...damn.

      Aha! I have reclaimed my screen name from whatever dirty bastard that stole it from me. How did I do it? A good magician never reveals his secrets. The culprit was never found because he apparently changed my password back to what it was before I caught on. However, I am still fully aware that it was in fact Louis Garafolo that committed this heinous crime. Don't try to change my mind either, because there is far too much evidence against the kid. I will spare him this time just because he has the benefit of the doubt, but I have already changed my password to prevent further instances of this horseshit from happening. Thanks to the asshole that did this, I am  never  going to give my password to anyone, ever again.  I watched a little NBA basketball action tonight on la tele, and for the most part, I liked what I saw. Let's play a little game of fortunately and unfortunately, just like in elementary school. Fortunately, the Magic had a 20 point comeback victory over the Hornets, and I saw the whole thing, cheering them all the way. Unfortunately, the Lakers beat the Rockets. Fortunately, Tracy Mcgrady dunked it all over everyone. Unfortunately, Shaq also dunked it all over everyone, multiple times. Fortunately, the Pistons won in overtime with a last second 3 pointer by Chauncey Billups. This made it the second time he's done that this season, and also made the Pistons 6-0 in overtime this season, the only team in the league to be undefeated in this category. Unfortunately, uhhh... there was nothing else bad that happened in the NBA tonight, all the other teams that I wanted to win won. Oh yeaaaaaah.  One last thing, I am now a student at The Shakespearian School of Liberal Arts, I was inducted yesterday. Isn't that wonderful? Before making a decision on that you should keep in mind that I am not being serious (as usual) and I don't even know what the hell "Liberal Arts" are, but I sure do hear that a lot.

      Today was crazy man. I got home from school at like 3:30 after a particularly lethargic feeling 7 or 8 hours (however long school is) and I layed down on my bed, until five minutes ago, I never got up.  I slept all freakin day . Now I feel hella confused and awake, and i'm wondering what the hell is going on. My parents aren't here, there are zero lights on, and there is nobody else here. It is starting to freak me out. But ya know, what can you do about it. Speaking of sleeping, I have been having a lot of weird dreams lately. Last night I had a really long dream that I didn't want to wake up from because it was so cool, I forget what it was about though. Then just now I had a dream that Louie was throwing rocks at me, and hitting me with them, in the head. What the hell is that.  In case you weren't aware, somebody has stolen my screen name, Garaputo316. They changed the password so I can't access it anymore. I have not found out who did it yet, but the search is certainly heating up. The only problem is there are a number of people who could have done it. You can bet that whenever I do find the bitch who did this, I am going to fry his fuckin balls on my stovetop. Well, I probably won't do that since it will most likely be one of my idiotic friends that eventually fess up to doing it, but I am not afraid to pee on my friends, as I have shown in the past (just ask Chris). So watch out...  I'm gonna git you sucka!

      My report card is really bad. Every grade that I thought I was getting in each class was one grade lower than that. They all fooled me. Except for Mrs. Parlade, I knew I was getting an F in here, and you can't go lower than that. I don't care about this crap though, i'm not gonna show it to my parents, ever. This nine weeks i'm gonna get all A's so when my parents do see it they'll be like whoa you did bad last time but this time you got all A's, you are the man. Yep, that's what's gonna happen, exact words and everything.  "Yeah! Afghanistan baby!" - quote Brandon Dicamillo before dropping into a half pipe and busting his ass... while wearing your basic towel head garb.

      I refuse to discuss more pressing matters, like "Operation Iraqi Freedom". Instead I will talk about whatever random bullshit comes into my head at this moment... There's a nasty cut on my arm from where Zac scratched me (twice) with his massive, ghastly nails. It turns out that a human scratch is worse than any other animal's. Well, except for  lions, tigers and bears, oh my . The worst thing of all is now  i'm gonna suffer from Zac Scratch Fever!  (do do do)  Did you know that John Kinder has been expelled for having cocaine on campus? I didn't until today. Can you believe that?  What a fiend that man is!

      I'm a mover and a shaker. I could sell water to a well. I am the stone cold pimp of the nation. I am all those things and more. As you can tell I have been listening to those personal motivation tapes lately. Am I being serious about this? Not a chance.  El verbo del dia es:  Nigger -  to be a loud, stinky, obnoxious motherfucker. Be sure to come back tomorrow when we discuss  Masturbater -  to wack off. Haha, that's a good one, I crack myself up. Spanish is such a funny language, I like to make fun of it.  Today is Jesseca and I's five month anniversary of going-out-ness! It is very cool stuff, but I think i'll celebrate more on this date next month, because that's like half a year man! Oh and did I mention that Jesseca Wales is the coolest girl and she rocks my world?  I'm not even tired right now even though I was up until like 2 a.m. last night, if not later. I am so happy about that too, because I was not looking forward to being tired all day. Ya know what else is interesting? I'm not even doing my work right now even though there are three assignments do at the end of class. Now that is not cool. I better get started because I have a lot of work to do, and not a lot of time to do it in.

      Yeah, I just beat  Onimusha 2  after playing it practically nonstop for the last 2 days. It was a very good sequel to an already excellent game. Hopefully the third and final one will improve the series even more when it comes out. Seems like i've been playing a lot of good games this month. I've already beaten  Onimusha ,  Devil May Cry , and now  Onimusha 2 . Can you guess what they all have in common? All I know is -  You gotta love the Capcom .  Chris and I watched CKY4 today and we were on a massive crazy quote kick, it was freakin awesome. We were IMing people and telling them crazy stuff and prank phone calling people, saying the lines we heard on CKY. Some of the things we said included "How many butts am I gonna have to cut before you people realize not to be dumbies!" and "This is the most haggard gear, ever." That was the least of it though. The thing that was said the most, by far, was this: *We ask someone a yes or no question*, whatever the answer is we say "Bitch well then, wack me off." Then we laughed histerically forever, it was great fun. It was especially funny when said to girls because it sounds all serious that way. Hahahahaha oh man. That is the quote of the day, definitely.   Example:  Garaputo316: Hey are you goin to the beach today? FoxyRoxy6103: Nope, it's raining. Garaputo316: Bitch well then, wack me off.  Ha! Now if that ain't comedy, I don't know what is.

      "I don't see what the big deal is" - the infamous Zac Burt right before snorting a large ass pile of crushed up lortabs and wigging the fuck out, it was possibly the greatest thing he's ever said. If not the greatest, then definitely the craziest...wait a minute, he has said some pretty crazy shit before... so let's just say it was pretty damn funny.  I always love the late night talks, but tonight it is extra special because I am hearing crazy stories out the gizang. I also find it funny that my night was all lame, I went to Red Lobster for like three hours and went home, that's it. No offense though Jesseca, I wouldn't have had it any other way, and the time never seemed right to tell you, but you looked  amazing  tonight. The reason everyone was checking you out is because you were the most  beautiful  girl in there. I'm for real. That's right, I said you are beautiful  and  amazing. I Love you!  You wanna know what craziness i'm talking about? Alright. First Colleen IMs me thinking i'm Alan and says some crazy stuff to me. I don't understand any of it. After I tell her that it's me she tells me what happened. Apparently Chris and Alan went to the party in NSB and wigged out. They were not aloud to stay the night there so get this - they are walking home. Yes, as I write this Alan and Chris are on a journey from New Symrna to Ormond. I have calculated the walking time between these places many times before and it comes out to approximately 6 hours of walking. That's a long time. To enhance the craziness of the situation they are probably either 1) drunk, or 2) high, or 3) both. To completely throw the insanity level out the window and make it off the charts, they were quoted for saying "It has been the craziest night, and it's not over yet." What a funny thing to say. Oh man they must be wiggin. I have a strange urge to go looking for them and maybe meet them halfway or something. But on foot the chances of me finding them would be slim, so screw it. That's not all though, the funniness continues. The party they were at got busted by the cops because this girl's ex boyfriend got jealous and called the cops on her. That was a pretty homosexual thing for him to do huh? Oh yeah, and did I mention that her ex was also mad because somebody peed in his car! LoL. For some reason that is funny to me. Probably because Louie peed in Twitch's car one time. Whoops, I mean...Louie didn't pee in Twitch's car...  Since I have nothing to do tomorrow at all (Jesseca has stuff to do and my friends are doing drugs or something, in any case i'm not involved in their plans), i'm gonna stay up really late tonight, hell I might even pull an all nighter. Either way i'm gonna leave out of my side door and roam the streets for a little while because I haven't done that for a while and I feel like it after hearing about the kooks walking home. Oh man if I stay up all night it's gonna be so crazy... but I better get to it now, later y' all.

      Man i'm always  really  tired in first block, like to the point where I nod off when we're listening to the  To Kill A Mockingbird   tape and trying to read, causing me to nearly hit my head on the desk every five seconds. It's so crazy. I try to pay attention and read the book but it's impossible because my vision gets all blurry, and i'm in an extremely uncomfortable position so i'm manuevering left and right all the time... it's very gay. I propose that we institute a nap time at Seabreeze High School, because they wake us up way too early to expect us to perform well, those homosexuals. Well when I become president in 2024 that will be my first action.  No matter what happens, tonight should be crazy as hell for me and Chris. I don't have time to explain why because i'm busy with this classwork, but tomorrow i'll probably write about what happened. On the bright side of things, school ends in only eight more weeks, isn't that unbelievable? I've got eight nigger slaves workin for me in my garden, and let me tell ya, that ain't nuthin. As if that weren't cool enough, we have Spring Break in three weeks as well. Spring Break will probably be fun, but I dunno, I kinda just want to get school done and out of the way. You can bet when it gets here I won't be saying that...  Wahaha I have three assignments to do right now. This should be fun. [the funny thing is i'm serious]  But before I go, here's a quick taunt for all my fellow Laker haters out there:  Lakers lose, Kings win... Shaq is related to Laden, Bin .

      Wouldn't it be crazy if some scientists injected a monkey with steroids and made it work out until it was really buff? I think it would. Then this little monkey could lift a bunch of weights for the viewing pleasure of everyone. It could even go to one of those muscle body competitions where the bodybuilders flex their muscles in a bunch of different ways and get judged on who has the best muscles. Imagine if a monkey won one of those things, it would be insane. Whew! Think about it,  a monkey on steroids, how funny is that?   Just don't ask me why the hell I thought of this.  Ya know what else is crazy? The whole class is doing work because they didn't finish it yet, when they were supposed to. The funny thing is I am the only one who did do the work, so I have a bunch of free time on my hands. It looks like the tables have turned suckas,  I love it .  I went to Wal-Mart last night, it was sweet. The coolest thing about it is I persuaded my mom to buy me Nothing To Lose on DVD. Oh man that movie is funny as hell. I watched it last night and I was cracking up, even though it was like 12 midnight and I have already seen it about 20 times. I probably shouldn't have watched it so late though, because now i'm tired as duke... oh well. I also bought this badass water yo-yo, it's my new addiction. I had never seen those things before but my sister says they are all the rage at her school. She said kids sell them at her school for small sums of money and she pops them over people's heads all the time. I'm just gonna have to bring the fad to high school, it will be awesome. I dunno though, I remember one time I tried to bring back yo-yos in like 8th grade, let's just say it didn't catch on too well. But these things are much cooler than traditional yo-yos. They are like a bigger version of those little gooey things you get in those machines for a quarter. Except they aren't sticky, and they have a water filled ball at the end that's fun to squeeze, giving them a second function as a stress reliever, but that's not all. Get this - the ball of water has sparkles in it, and  the sparkles are shiny!  oooooh, ahhhh. All of this for only a dollar at Wal-Mart, and there is plenty of them available. Now go out and buy one. *Wink*  Guess what today is? My mom's birthday! I bet you thought I was gonna say something like "It's Saddam Hussein's Deathday!" or "The beginning of the end of the world!", but nope. It is kind of weird that  my mother's birthday is on the same day as the start of the U.S. invasion of Iraq . It's pretty cool actually. Hopefully everything goes to plan and we don't miscalculate anything major, if that is the case then this war will be a real joke. It's clear that our military is superior to Iraq's in pretty much every way. We should take advantage of this and make it a quick war, then we'll laugh about it later. I think the only thing we should worry about is those crazy terrorists trying to destroy U.S. monuments and large buildings and such. There is, however, an easy way of preventing this from happening -  If you know any Arabic people, whether you think they are good or bad, beat the crap out of them right now . Then we'll see how much they help ol' Saddam.   Happy Birthday  to my motha, and to the U.S. Troops over in Iraq: Go forth and kick ass.

      Mr. Phillips gave a long speech about a lot of things today and he convinced me that it's time to perform well in school. So i'm going to attempt to get straight A's this nine weeks and end this school year on a positive note. It should be easy enough, I just need to start paying attention and doing  all  my work, that means even my homework. It kind of sucks, but I have plenty of free time anyways. On the good side of things, we have an unusually long summer this year. If what I heard is right, we get out on May 28th and come back August 24th. That's a little under three months off. I can't wait for that...and I mean that literally.  Oh man...I wrote a bunch of shit after that paragraph about basketball and the Holly Hill rec and stuff, but it didn't publish, and right after the first paragraph is the last time I saved. Oh golly gee, that stinks.

      I stayed home from school today. The funny thing is I didn't get as much done as I usually do when I don't go to school. You know why? Because  I was actually sick . Yes, you heard me right, I had a genuine stomach ache. It wasn't as bad as I made it out to be, but it still hurt nonetheless. I spent pretty much the whole day sleeping. I would say that is a good thing because I needed to catch up on some sleep anyway. I'm also about to add Ricky's journal to my links, so everyone can start to celebrate. I just read his most recent journal by the way, and it was really good. I thought it was one of his best... Well it made me laugh, and that's all you can ask for in a journal.  I sent some crazy e-mail to Jesseca last night after she signed off on me, and it wasn't meant to be mean or anything but I really hope she doesn't/ didn't take it the wrong way. Read her journal too, and I thought the strip Magic thing was funny, and that's all I will say because the last thing I want to do is start an argument with her... Right now though i'm pretty damn hungry after not eating anything all day. With that in mind,  it is time for me to eat my own self out of house and home .

      I just added Jesseca, Zac, and Shannon's journals / blogs (whatever you wanna call em) to my links sidebar thingamajigger. I wanted to put Ricky's on there too but I couldn't think of his Livejournal or AIM screen name for the life of me. It pissed me off too. It was one of those things that you know you know (redundancy runs wild!) and it's on the tip of your tongue but you just can't think of it. Oh well, I will put it on there when I get home. If the links or archives don't work for a little while today that's because I need to republish everything, and I will do that when I get home because  I don't trust these school computers ...  I didn't write anything in this for like four days, if I didn't post today I would start feeling like on of those people that don't write stuff in their blogs for weeks at a time **cougheveryoneunderthefreakingsuncoughcough**. To tell the truth I had plenty of stuff to write about, but it was all dorky and mostly involved Magic,  and you know how I hate coming off as a dorkass queer . So yeah...  There is a crazy looking (large lips and head, small body)  african american  sitting a few feet behind me, and you know what? He cracks me up!

       Red Face Magee's girlfriend is the Guiness Book of World Records holder for The Longest Asscheeks . Hahaha, for some reason I find that exceptionally funny. It's almost as funny as the Red Faced kook himself coming to school with a hardcore sunburn, while he's embarassed...but not quite. LoL, I crack myself up. Yeah, and sorry about the crazy capitalization techniques, but  Lol just doesn't look right to me .  I'm sure that you've all seen that crazy ass retarded sonofabitch that walks the halls of Seabreeze with a rolling backpack, sporting the thickest glasses you've ever seen and talking to himself, right? Everytime I see him I wonder "What the fuck is this kid doing?", I wanna know what is wrong with that kookabara. Wait a second, I don't care actually. Nonetheless, he is one of the craziest characters this school has to offer, and is always good for a few laughs. Whether you are alone or with friends, he never dissapoints.  *sigh* Those good old retarded people ...  I think i'm gonna start training for basketball pretty soon, that way  i'll be the dominant factor this summer when we play the Hursties and other random goons . I gotta work on my dribble for one thing, because it is seriously lacking. My inside drive game could be improved as well, since it is basically non-existant. It's ok though, i'm sure I can come up with some crazy ass moves. If nothing else, they will make the opponent laugh long enough for me to make like "The Vulture" I am and lay it in while they're distracted. My shot is pretty good, especially in a gym, so i'll just have to get that back to the point it was. I'm also gonna concentrate on defensive manuevers, if I could learn how to steal the ball efficiently, that would be cool. Ya know what though, I talk about doing all this stuff, but in reality it will probably take me a month or two to actually start this endeavor. So ha.  I'm so glad that  the weekend starts today, and it's four days long!  Some people might say it's three days, meaning Friday, Saturday and Sunday, but for that I would call them pessimistic. To me, the last day of the school week is part of the weekend, mostly because on that day you can stay up as late as you want. In any case, I can't wait to wig out. It should be fun. I'll be able to do a bunch of stuff that I need to do, and much more. There's even more relatives coming to stay at my house tonight, so i'm not sure what it's going to be like.  One thing is for certain, it will be interesting . I imagine that everyone will be gone until about 3 in the morning every night partying, here's hoping.  Alright i'm done writing in this.  I'm wasting my time, I have work to do .

      Oh hell yeah. My cousin Derek is the real deal bitches. He is one of those all american type pimps. He was just talking about how he wants to join the Marines in order to kill people. Then he told some story about how his sister is hyping him up to this rival baseball team and how he is gonna have to drop bombs on those motherfuckers. He's extremely built, perfect athlete style, but bigger. He was swinging my bat around and saying crazy threats under his breath as if he was mad at the other team and everyone in the living room backed off in fear. Not to mention, he ate a meal of two men at Denny's this morning. Even now he is cussing and shit about how he is gonna dominate everyone in baseball this season. There is no question, Derek rocks the earth.

      Whoooo what is with all these bastard asses making these crazy websites where it's song lyrics and singing scrolling across the screen and then all of the sudden it changes to a grisly image of a dead person accompanied by loud screaming and such? You know what i'm talkin about don't ya? Yeaahhh I hate those fuckin things, they scare the bejeesus out of me everytime. Even when I know it's comin. Maybe i'm just a scaredy cat. I just saw one of those things, that's why i'm wigging out about it. To make up for it though, I saw some uber radical robot dancing craziness a minute ago. It was a video of this kid busting out these insane robotic dance moves and it simply must be seen to be believed! It's outrageous man! It's worth coming over my house just to watch it, that's how good it is. It's great.  In case you were wondering, my mom woke up late this morning so neither me or my sister went to school today. I missed the FCAT testing, and as you know that is required to graduate... i'm not too worried about it though. It did mean I got to spend the day getting some stuff done around here. My dad hooked up the desk for the computer in my living room and moved it into his abode, letting me take the entertainment center and set it up in my room. I spent pretty much the entire day hooking up my systems and rearranging my room. Speaking of which,  my room is now the ultimate paradise . I especially like how my new tv looks in there (it's 32 inches, old school, and sexy) and to add to the excitement, my new game console layout is amazing... I should seriously get a job installing video game systems because I love doing it, I live for that kind of shit. Too bad that's not a job, and if it is, it definitely pays too low for my tastes. Oh well, there's always the wide-open field of bike repair...  Today my mind is really a mixed bag of thoughts, so I will be changing subjects like mad. Just lettin you know so you have some sort of preparation... Since last night the flood of family members and their friends has started pouring in, and  my house has already been transformed into the party zone of the nation . It has been a crazy house all day long. Maybe it's because everyone is excited about the good weather we had. Nahhh that's just because everybody is drunk. For real though, it's the first time the sun has been out for weeks, the bikers must be happy, my dad and his compadres included. It must have been the hottest day of the year so far. I was sweatin my ass off, that's for sure. The crazy thing is, we ain't seen nuthin yet.  I went and hung out with Jesseca and her gang (Katelin and the rest of the family) yesterday. The plan was to go to Hooters but that place was packed to the brim with rowdy bikers. We figured we would let them have their fun, we weren't gonna wait 2 hours to get our food. After discovering that the Winghouse was packed as well, we decided to just go back to her house and order pizza & wings. It turned out pretty fun in the end, I thought so anyways. Did I mention that  Jesseca is so pretty she makes all the other girls look bad ? Well that is true. It's also the lovely one's birthday today, so  Happy Birthday Jessie! I Love You!   Oh man I went to Denny's today and had the Grand Slam for breakfast/lunch (or "brunch", for people who like to use short ugly abbrieviations for two words put together), it was good as hell. I had a couple of my sister Chasity's sandwiches too, but I don't know what they were called, all I know is they tasted very good...Oh guess what? My cousin Sherry brought her webcam with her, so now I can make all the crazy videos/ pictures I want for the next week. The only drawback is it's all cheapo and slow, and I hate crappy technology with a passion. So I will probably only use it on a limited basis, just for the obligatory crazy face and stance shots. It should, however, still be great fun. Take warning though,  I will probably end up taking a picture of my penis at one time or another, so look out for that.   Have you guys seen Louie's new truck? It is badass. I would probably be the last person to admit something like this, but I must say, it is pretty nice. It's black with dual exhaust and John style wooden interior, it's even got the rain blocker window thingys. I also dig the old school knobs and stuff. As you might be able to tell, I don't know much about the inner workings of cars or anything like that, but it looks (and sounds) cool to me.  Good job Louis . Oh yeah, if anyone remembers that I am currently in a state of hatred with Shannon, that thing is over. I can't even put my finger on the reason that I started "hating" her in the first place. Well actually I can, but it's a really long and detailed story that I don't feel like telling right now. So let it be known that I have no problem with her anymore, not that it matters too much since we're not really friends. But ya know, just thought I would let everyone know.  Switching gears a little [so to speak], has anyone else noticed that Jocelyn is going out with a black man? Looks like she has come down with a bad case of jungle fever. I think that is hella nasty, as always. I believe he goes by the name of 'Money Mark', so that's funny. I think everyone noticed that she is going out with this black kid, it's just that nobody cares enough about Jocelyn anymore to really say anything about it. This is the sort of trash that everyone has come to expect from her, and you know what they say - "Once you go black, you never go back." She is doomed! Too bad nobody cares! (Now watch everyone at school tell her about this and before I know it i'll have this stinky nig in my face, lol. Oh well, that's what happens.)  Since I don't want to end this talking about the Joss and her nigger-loving escapades I will bring up one more thing before I go...Does anyone remember Mike King's old site? It was called Fat Cats Galore. Specifically I am talking about the message boards. That was easily the biggest success in the arena of popularity that he's ever experienced, so some of you might just know about it. In any case, I used to wreak havoc there all the time, it was so much fun. I wrote some of the most insanely obscene things anyone could ever think of. It was crazy to the point of shocking, that was the beauty of it. It was around the time of my shock humor peak. The gay thing is the little fucker deleted all my posts because they were too graphic(That is why  i'm going to kill you when I join the army, Mike ). So what if MSN would terminate his account, that stuff was friggin hilarious. My screen name (or tag, as some may call it) was ASS PUMPER. It was the best. name. ever. Ah those were the days.  Man that was one long update.  I just had so many things on my mind and I couldn't stop . It reminds me of the old times when I used to sit here for upwards of four hours and just write. Some things to expect in the near future are more links added to the sidebar over there, including Jesseca's blog and Shannon/ Zachary's Live Journals. That should be cool...And now for the most brilliant ending ever concieved, as written on my living room computer's screen saver for the last six months, in all it's crappily worded glory:  We all know that living on earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the sun

      The FCAT testing just went down, it was awesome man. I can't wait till tomorrow, that's when we get to do the Math portion of it! Sweet! I got to McDonalds early and I was suckered into buying a bunch of stuff because there was nobody in line. I ate some fries, a drink, a double cheeseburger, and  two  apple pies...beat that Jesseca. They let the freshies go off campus today, they were all excited, haha I remember those days... When we got back to school Zac stomped a full orange juice bottle with maximum force and made it explode all over the place, it was crazy as shyte. I also let Chris and others drink off of my drink, i'm thinking that was a big mistake. Oh man now i'm feeling some odd sensations in my throat, if I have mono I am going to murder everyone. What's that? "You guys opened my window?  If any bugs get in here I am going to kill myself! " LoL! That's a direct quote from Elyse, woooo she is the craziest.

      I am pissed off like shit in a bucket right now. I feel like I just got screwed out of the title... maybe it's because I did. Damn Frank and his semi-infinite combo bullshit to hell. In fact,  fuck all those cardshop geek motherfuckers , especially Twitch, because that bastard makes crazy rules judgements like mad. They all can take their "damage on the stack", "in response", and "tokens in the graveyard" and shove em straight up their candy ass! (old school Rock style) Next time someone beats me in a cheap manner like that one of three things is gonna happen: 1) I flip the table over, jump on em and just start swingin... 2) I tap five lands and bring the "bat" card into play (which is in reality an actual baseball bat) and hit them directly in the fuckin head... or 3) I rip up the card that is causing me the trouble and throw it in their face, and then take the fucker's deck and throw it into the nearest fan, and proceed to laugh like a maniac.  We'll see who cheats who when I launch a grenade into that place and blow it to the fuckin moon .  You might think it's funny that I get so mad about Magic cards, but I meant it to come off that way. Plus you gotta understand that I don't appreciate getting fucked over, no matter what the situation may be. Also, if you think that was funny, you would probably like to know that I plan on robbing the cardshop one of these days. When it happens, and they're asking around to see who did it, do me a favor and  don't tell em it was me .   Did you know that today's date is 3/3/03? What an anomaly!

      Man what a long weekend...and I mean that in the best way possible. It seemed like it was summertime to me, maybe because I had a lot of fun and didn't think about school at all. I hung out with Jesseca on Friday and Sunday, so that was awesome. The only problem is I probably won't talk to her until Friday, that's ok though because I bet anything that I'll talk to her before that. My cousin Derek is down here from Michigan for College Spring Break. That's what my family tells me anyway, but I haven't seen him yet. Everyone is saying he's all big, buff, and "hot"...well I believe it (not the hot part...you nasties) because last time I saw him he was pretty big. Derek is very jock looking and he's supposedly pretty good at the baseball, so hopefully he'll get into the Major Leagues. Then we would have someone famous in our family, that would be pimp.  As for today i'm supposed to go get a haircut after school, but i'm liking how my hair is kinda long and shabby right now. So i'm gonna leave it like this for one more day and get it cut tomorrow. I feel like burning a CD today too, but I don't think i'll have time because that takes hours (when I do it anyways). Alan and I have had plans to go to the Magic tourny that takes place today since last Monday. With that in mind, what i'm most likely to do is go to the cardshop (with or without Alan) and try to steal the tournament with zero mental preparation. If I have the carefree, confident attitude there is no way I can lose, at least I figure as much...  I have sort of neglected the subject of school thus far, but that's only because this week is nothing to be worried about, for many reasons. First of all it's a shortened week, with no school Friday. Secondly, we have FCAT tomorrow and Wednesday. I happen to like FCAT, so this is not a bad thing for me by any reasoning. Third, today is already over as far as i'm concerned...and Last, Thursday of this week will act as Friday of the normal week and therefore will be fun and layed back, with minimal work involved. All things considered, and  simple math will tell you that we have zero school left in this week . Oh yeah!

      I spent all day playing Onimusha today, it was not a bad way to spend my time, not bad at all. I beat it of course, since I don't play no games when it comes to playin games, if ya know what I mean. It was way better than I expected it to be, and it couldn't have came along at a better time. Right when I was starting to lose faith in videogames and thought I had outgrown them or something, I beat down a few hundred (or maybe thousand) demons and I remember how fun they can be.  Keeping on the subject of videogames, i'm about to begin playing Devil May Cry. I'm gonna try and get through as many levels as I can before I fall asleep, this should be fun. I have one thing left to say before I kick everyone's ass -  Hide the women and children, because here comes the thunder!   Oh yeah, and  I Love Jesseca Wales!

      "There are two ugly people in the world and your momma is both of em" - Some crazy black guy on this commercial that made me laugh out loud more than once.  I was kinda stressed out a little earlier but now i'm all cheered up thanks to the many wonders of the internet. Namely Zac's latest LiveJournal thingy and this crazy comment posted on Ricky's Journal: FAGGOTS AND RETARDS NEED TO FUCKING DIE!!! SPECIALLY ADAM AND I KNOW YOU AGREE RICKY. SO ADD ME MUTHA FUKA -- BRYANHIMSELF... it seems to me that this guy has lost his marbles. Oh yeah, and the EGM message boards have provided a nice distraction for me as well.   Now i'm off to rally for reading. So let me try out my voice real quick. "Hell yeah everybody! Join the cause, help us in our fight! Not reading is our plight! Let us read together...tonight!" Okay, i'm good.

      My hair is crazy as hell today so i'm gonna download a virus onto this shit. That will teach it.  Dashboard Confessional is awesome. The songs are all so extremely cynical, it's great if you're into hating the world and stuff. And I know how you people love hating the world. Don't believe it? Then check this out -    The Good Fight   Consider the odds, consider the obvious. The martyr is meaningless, the campaign has died. In the planning stages and the fallen faces are the singular proof that it was ever alive.  This purchased rebellion has been outdated, denounced and rescinded and left to die championless. I begged you not to go. I begged you, I pleaded. Claimed you as my only hope and watched the floor as you retreated.  Hope has sprung a perfect dive a perfect day, a perfect lie. A slowly crafted monologue conceding your defeat.  Does it comfort you to know you fought the good fight? Basking in your victory, hollow and alone to boast your bitter bragging rights to anyone who'll listen. While you're left with nothing tangible to gain.  See, Chris Carabba is the man. His middle name is Ender too, so one of these days he will probably get fed up with this shit and end everyone's life. Ya know, because he's the ender.

      Man I want Jesseca's bod, but she has an eye appointment tomorrow so I won't be able to go see her. I will see her as soon as I can though, maybe Wednesday if i'm lucky. In the meantime I have to occupy myself doing some other things. I would work on my website but I have three very important and heavy weighing (grade wise) English papers to write. Two of them are already late so procrastination is not an option. I will have to be the writing machine that I am and churn out all 3 in one night. It might actually be fun. And about the site, I have finished four brand new pages that are all ready to be published. The only reason I haven't put them up yet is because I don't think that's enough. I want this to be a massive update that will make make my website worth going to more than once just to get the basic run through and leave. I will make at least one more new section before I publish it, but probably more. I just don't know when that will be.  A few more little tidbits of information for those who care about our new video. The official name is CRYK a.k.a. Cutter Rocks You Kook, it will be a Nincompoop Production, and it will absolutely knock your block off with its high concentration of comedic hilarity.

      "Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?" Anyone remember that from Wizard of Oz? Hahaha I do. Don't ask me why the hell I thought of that either, because I have no idea.  I take back what I said in my last post about everyone and everything kicking ass. I meant everything except school. This crap needs to hurry up and get over with, because I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day, but school is holding me back and not letting me reach that goal. Besides that, we've already been going to this shit for far too long and we need a break already. Well I do anyways, I can't speak for anyone else. It's cool though because it's April 28th and we get out on May 28th. This makes it exactly one month until summer. That being said I only have one thing left to say to Mr. School: Your days are numbered motherfucker (literally).

      I'm tired as all get out right now but i'm forced to make 15 CDs for big Dan the handy man (my sister's boyfriend/ fiance). It's cool with me though because i'm getting some fast cash in the deal. 5 dollars down and then 10 more when I finish them all. Add that shit up and it equals a cool 15 dollas for the Davemyster. If anyone else wants to give me some easy money then they are free to do so. I'll even make you a CD. Or you can C- Dees nuts in yo mouth, your choice.  I did so much stuff this weekend and i'm so tired from it I don't know if I even want to talk about it. Oh well, I will make it "brief". On Friday I went to Jesseca's and hung out there pretty much all day. It was very fun as usual. I just wish we could've hung out longer, because even though we were together for a lot of hours, I just can't get enough of miss Jesse. On Saturday I had plans with Colleen so I didn't go anywhere all day and I ended up being by myself throughout it because she didn't call. Being alone isn't such a bad thing for me though as i've stated before, so it was alright. She finally ended up calling me at like 10:30 at night and telling me that her and Stephanie were coming. I was pretty surprised by it, but you know me, i'm down for whatever. I had to give them directions on the phone and it was pretty hard because my voice is too deep for em, but they got here eventually. We were supposed to hang out with Louie and Chris but they made other plans and pretty much screwed over Colleen and Steph after they drove 30 minutes from NSB. They were mad and stuff but I guess it was alright in the end because they figured out never to come down here again for those kids. Us three came to my house and chilled in my computer room for an hour and a half or so. It turned out pretty fun since they were both cool and funny. Today was Sunday and I slept in till 2. I found out from Jesseca soon after that church was canceled. Imagine that, one of the only times I was actually looking forward to it they don't have it. I still wanted to hang out with Jesseca badly, but she informed me that Louie and company were coming over to wig out on me or whatever and they arrived like two seconds later so that was the last time i've talked to her. Me, Alan, Chris, Louie, and Kelly hung out all freakin day today filming skits and messing around. It was so much fun, I had a blast. We did some fuckin radical skits too and I am so overjoyed by the way things are going skitwise. Everyone worked together and we agreed with eachother a lot. I don't even think there was one argument the whole day. We also started editing the final tape today and it is going extremely well like everything else. Our tape is going to be so montrously awesome when we're done with it that nobody will know what to do about it. It rocks.  Ah well i'm done writing now because i'm too excited for this boringness. I've been writing forever and if I keep this up i'll be sitting here all night just rambling. I just want to say that I am really happy with life and how things are going right now. In my mind everybody and everything kicks ass. I hope it stays like this for a long time to come. Peace my niggas.

      In case you haven't heard, Jesseca got ahold of a copy of the infamous  Bad Karma . If you don't know what that is then you are a gigantic fartknocker and you don't need to know anyway. If you do know about it, then you will be pleased to know that it was watched by not only her (which is crazy enough), but by her whole family. The good news is they actually liked it. Her mom said quote, "I will never be able to look at Dave without laughing again." Finally somebody appreciates what we did. I think everybody else is either too young or too dumb to understand it or something, because the humor  is  very... unique.  I'm going to Jesseca's house after school today as soon as possible because it's our 6 month anniversary. Yes you heard me right, we have been going out for 6 months. I'm so happy that we've been rocking eachothers worlds for so long. Here's to us. Nothing else compares to the coolness of this occasion for me right now so i'm done writing in this.  I Love You Jesseca!

      I'm wearing my sweater today... now I look like an idiot and I feel like a Hot Boy. In my defense, it was cold this morning and my mom told me to put it on. I probably shouldn't have listened to her, but meh, what can ya do.  A message to the haters: Tokilla Mockingbird rocks my world.  Holy Crap did you see the T-Wolves - Lakers game last night? I did, and it pretty much shattered everything I have said before into a million pieces. The Lakers have now been beat, by a lot (28 points to be exact), by the Timberwolves. That was crazy man, and I thought game one was a blow-out. I'll still go with the Lakers for the series because beating them once is one thing, but beating them four times is something that I don't think can be done. Not by Kevin Garnett and his gang anyway, but maybe i'll be surprised again.

      Back to school, back to school... The only good thing about going to school today was walking into class and coming to the realization that we only have five weeks left. That's not that much longer, like a month and a week. So don't worry my friends, summer will be here soon.  I was gonna go over Jesseca's house after school today so I could show her this amazing card trick that I just learned, but since our 6 month anniversary is coming up on Thursday I figured I would wait until then to go there. This trick is mindblowing though, you gotta believe me. It seems like a pretty big occasion also, so I think I should get her something. The only problem is I only have 10-15 dollars at most. I'll still go looking for something, but I dunno, that ain't much. We'll see what I can do.  The NBA playoffs are shaping up quite nicely. The two 8 seeds have already taken home court advantage from the #1 teams. The Kings have gone up 2-0 on the Jazz while everyone else has failed to do the same. Expect the Lakers to put the same deficit on the Timberwolves tonight. In the East my pick has already gone wrong, as Orlando looks like they will get an upset series win over Detroit, but ya never know. And even though Sacremento had an impressive game last night against Utah, I have yet to see any evidence that  anyone  can beat the Lakers. Did you see game 1 against Minnesota? It was a complete joke. That's all I have to say about this, but an SI.com writer put it best when he said "Anybody who doubts the Lakers now probably also believes in the Easter Bunny."

      Oh no, Easter is over, what is a boy to do? Eat all this SUGAARRR!!!!  So I have come to the conclusion that Louie likes night clubs...a lot. That's all he talks about these days is those damned night clubs. He even called me tonight and tried to get me to go to 600 North with him. I abstained [courteously] because I was watching Road to Perdition. And besides, what the hell would I do at a night club!? Nothin that's what. For one, I have a girlfriend (who I love so very much), so I wouldn't be doing any grinding on all the female club-goers. Two... well there is no two because that's the only reason people go to clubs anyway, to dance with the opposite sex in a sexual manner. So instead of going to 600 North you can go 600 miles south to Cuba and get butt raped by Fidel Castro, and all of you can take your Fuel and put it in my mother's big blue Chevy Astro van. Haha. Nah i'm just messin with ya Louie, whatever floats your boat, or wets your whistle... is cool with me.  Jesseca is such a hottie.

      I went to my aunt Jennifer's house today, as planned. She talked about opening up her midget strip club, as usual, and this time she even added a little rhetoric about how black people from the Carribean Islands are not considered niggers. My uncle Guy argued that niggers are niggers no matter where they come from, and I agree with him, with no disrespect to my dawgs of course. My cousin Vinny is still an asshole and my cousin Leo is still fat. They called me a pothead (I fucking hate that by the way because I don't smoke), and they said I sucked at videogames repeatedly. I got them both back though. When I insulted this crazy videogame that they were playing Vincent got all mad and said some stuff about how I sucked at videogames. I don't know about you, but when somebody says something like that to me I take that as a challenge. And if you know me, I don't even need to be challenged or pissed off to beat the crap out of somebody at a videogame, I do that just for fun. So a little while later when we were playing a game that we actually competed against eachother in (Timesplitters 2, a sub-par first person shooter for the uninformed), I took that as an opportunity to show him who sucks at videogames. Naturally, I whooped both of their asses in nearly every single round of play. Then Vin got all mad and tryed to hit me with a pillow but I easily blocked it. I find it funny when people try to take out their frustration on me in the real world, it just shows how much I got to them. They eventually got sick of my relentless assault and shut off the game... Then I said "Who sucks now you fuck?" and walked out.  I am fresh off the recliner from viewing the film  Road to Perdition . I can't say enough about how good this movie is. Among other things, my grandmother called it "Spellbounding." I like that word, so that will do. I especially liked the last few scenes at the beach and the aunt's house, they had such wonderful directing and beautiful imagery, it was fantastic. Oh yeah and mad props to the fashion/ wardrobe manager of that movie, the costumes were great. The rain scenes were also magnificent looking. As you can see the movie is very aesthetically pleasing, but that is not all it has to offer, the story is pretty good too. Enough of my babbling though, I think you should just watch it because it's most definitely worth your time.  Where oh where could my baby be? It is her that I want to see.

Man on the news they're always talkin about the shi'ites in Iraq. When I first heard that I almost pissed my pants I laughed so hard, what are they talking about?  Note: None of you smartypants hippies better IM me telling me what a shi'ite is, because I already know, it's called a joke you shitmongers.

      "Y'all don't know what it's like being male, middle class, and white."  Well, I just gave Jesseca a ringaling and she didn't answer her phone. I must have missed her. I didn't really expect her to be home since I woke up like 4 hours too late because that's how it goes. I suppose she's off hanging out with whoever, so you know what that means... it's Zelda time for Dave. That's one of the many things I love about videogames, you don't have to worry about them leaving you to go off and do something else, they will always be there for ya. I will go return the favor.  In the meantime, everyone should download  Ben Folds Five - Rockin The Suburbs  and listen to it immediately. He rocks the suburbs just like Micheal Jackson did, except that he was talented.

      Last night was kind of weird. It was Friday, of course, but I didn't do anything. I was supposed to go over Jesseca's house but her mom went crazy and said that she had to babysit 2 kids, and I couldn't come over because she wouldn't pay attention to them if I was there. I guess that's true, but why is she babysitting people on Friday anyway? Beats me. My backup plan was to go with Louie to Orlando to see House of 1000 Corpses, but that was kind of a longshot because he called and told me that we were going on Wednesday and I didn't talk to him at all Thursday. In any case, Louie never called, and I don't even know his number... so yeah, I didn't do that. I ended up staying home and playing Zelda. This was not a problem really, the game is wonderful. The crazy thing is I played it nonstop last night, for too long probably (i'm thinking around 14 hours...), and I didn't beat it. I am impressed by the length of the game because I have played the hell out of it and i'm not even near the end yet. I don't know when i'll have time to finish it! Here's the plan for the rest of the break though: I'm going to hang out with Jesseca all day today most likely, but then she has to babysit at night so at that time i'm gonna go get a badly needed haircut. When I get home i'll find something to do, like get to the end of, or finish  The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker . If you're wondering what i'm doing tommorow; I am being forced to spend Easter Sunday at my aunt Jennifer's house. Oh how I  hate  that place, nobody knows. It wouldn't be bad if somebody would murder my bastardly cousin Vincent because he is the cause of all my troubles. I don't just mean at my aunt Jennifer's house, I refer to my life in general. I do hear that my "good" cousin Leo will be there this time. So maybe i'll have a tag partner in the wrestling matches that the evil one sets up, and just maybe he will bail me out of all those goddamned headlocks that Vin- Diesel puts me in. Someone please end that asshole's life! On another note, I don't know what is happening on Monday. I'm thinking if I don't hang out with Jesseca the Beautiful and i've already beaten Zelda then I will spend two hours walking to Best Buy in order to purchase the motion picture  Donnie Darko  and the rest of the day I will spend watching it over and over until I fall asleep. After that, on Tuesday, is school. Oh my, we all know that ain't good...

      You know what I think? I think that  Jesseca Wales is the best girl in the whole world .  I have come to a point in Zelda where I can accurately judge how good it is. I could talk for hours about how much the game rocks my socks and how fun it is, but I will only say this: "I Loooove it" - Snoop Dogg style.  The NBA Regular season has come to a close at last. I thought there were some pretty surprising playoff pairings, but that's just me. However, it is time to take your picks for who will win their respective conferences. Here are mine: In the West we have the L.A. Lakers. This should come as no surprise to anyone who read what I wrote about the Lakers a little while back... and in the East I will take the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were more of a hometown favoritism thing, but hey, it's not like it will matter who wins the East anyways. I predict the Lakers will win it all of course. Man it is going to be so funny if the Lakers lose...  In other news - Mother 1 + 2 and Mother 3 have been officially announced to be in development for Game Boy Advance. Hold on let me let that sink in for a minute before I explain... OK. Translation: The best game ever made [Earthbound in the US, Mother 2 in Japan], which also happens to be my favorite game since I was 8 years old, and its prequel [Mother, never before released in the U.S.] will be ported, on the same cartridge, onto the GBA on June 20th (in Japan). As if that weren't enough good news for one day, or even a year, the long awaited sequel (that was "canceled" a long time ago), Mother 3/ Earthbound 2, has also been revealed to be in development for the GBA. You do not know how much joy this brings me, and I won't even try to explain because it would sound too dorky, but to quote Coach Skipper - "This is awesome folks, awesome."  That's not all of the surprise announcements I have up my sleeve... How about this one. Bad Karma [or in this case "Good Karma"] is back in production! This comes after probably a year or more of not doing anything skit related, how cool. I can't reveal any of the actual skits that were done on here because we're only showing the tape to trusted friends this time around, but trust me, they are crazy. If you don't believe me then take John's word for it and BELIEVE  THIS : On day one, we go to the park, we get stopped by the cops. Almost directly after we go to Shadow Lakes, the cops wig out on us, again (same ones too lol). To sum it up, we've been filming for about 6 hours at most and we've already been hassled by the man twice, now what does that tell ya? It tells me that there's plenty more where that came from.  I've watched 4 movies in the last 3 days, so it's time to give my little mini review of them all. If you're not into movies or whatever then you can stop reading now because there's gonna be nothing else past this point. If this applies to you, see you later, movie hater. For the rest of you [normal] people, let's begin...  Silent Night Deadly Night 3:  I honestly wasn't expecting much from this movie, seeing as the first two in the series blew large balls when realistically considered as films. Although I will admit that they were great for laughs. So how does this movie size up to its predecessors? It was much, much worse. I can't believe the higher ups at this company would allow anyone to release such a catastrophe! The acting was horrible, the story didn't make sense, and there were like 5 lines of dialogue in the whole movie. The one good thing about this movie is that it's so stupid it's funny. Please watch this movie only if you're an asshole.  Silent Night Deadly Night 4:  The "continuation" of the movie I just talked about, the only problem is the two have nothing to do with eachother whatsoever. This is definitely the Halloween 3 of the series. In lamans terms, the black sheep. Just when you thought a movie couldn't get worse, this sucker rolls around the corner and slaps you in the face. Clint Howard has a starring role in it for god's sake, what more do I have to say? Oh, how about it's gross (not in a good way by any means), has an ugly girl getting nude in it, depicts a man getting jabbed in the stomach with the stick end of a broom, and involves cultish lesbian ceremonies where bugs get spewed out of people's mouths. Now that is trash. This movie isn't funny at all either, so don't even think about redeeming qualities.  Silent Night Deadly Night 5:  Do you see a pattern here? This one is actually a little better than the other two, but not by much. The plot revolves around a maniacal toy maker, humorously named "Joe Petto", who creates his own killer toys and sends them out to little boys and girls at christmas time. It does sound kind of cool, and that's why it was better than 3 & 4, but sadly, when compared to practically any other movie in existence, it is a bad joke. With that in mind, i'll humor myself and judge it as if it weren't a piece of trash. There was a cool twist at the end where something happens and you don't think it will... ahhh who am I kidding - just take my advice and never watch this movie ever.  The Ring:  No jokes here, this was a good movie. One thing I noticed was that the directing and cinematography were pretty good, almost to the point where it seemed like a Sundance movie, but not quite. That's alright though, because this movie does what it sets out to do, and that is to scare the crap out of you. It sets the mood very early and keeps you interested until the very end. There is only one cheap "SURPRISE!" scare to speak of, and the rest of the terror comes from the film's ability to get into your mind and freak you out. It does a good job of that...until the end. Let me try to say this without spoiling anything. One of the best things the movie has going for it is its mystery, because let's face it, there is no director in the world that could think of more stuff that freaks you out than your own brain. When your imagination goes on its own course and thinks of all these horrific things on its own, there is nothing scarier. If the people who made it would realize this then the movie would probably be a lot better. As it is though, the only thing wrong is that the end explains why the people died or didn't die, and it's a stupid reason (I thought), and would be better left unsaid. Besides that, this is a solid and very scary movie. Despite my minor grievances, it's definitely a good one to bring home from the movie store because it is entertaining, and overall, it is a good flick.  And now I go to sleep.

      It's 1:00 in the morning and I just ran all the way to Chris's house (approximately 3 miles from here), threw a couple rocks at his window, stole his bike, and came back home. Somewhere in between that time I ended up Splinter Celling past (not one, not two, but...) 3 cop cars, knocking over a bunch of cones, and breaking a beer bottle in the road for no apparent reason. Now my ass is in severe pain from Chris's P.O.S. bike, i'm cold as shyte, and I have a stomach cramp from hell... too much damn physical activity for only having 3 total hours of sleep within the last two days. In other words, i'm going to sleep.

      Yeah so it took me a while, but I finally got over what happened on friday. Mainly because I listened to the sound clip of Arnold Swarzchenegger saying "STOP BEING SUCH A PUSSY!" over and over. Haha no I didn't.  Here's a quick recap of the past couple days since I don't really feel like writing too much. I spent most of friday fiddling with my website. There's a fair amount of new crap on there. It's probably the biggest update i've done ever, so be sure to take a gander at that. Just be aware that it's crazy. I beat FF7 yesterday. I'm kind of proud of that because Zac and Louie both talked about how they got near the end and quit. I don't know if it was too hard for them, too long or what but it seemed exceptionally short and easy to me, probably 'cause i'm Dave... I also started  Zelda: The Wind Waker , but it's too early to tell whether it's good or not. Time will tell. I hung out with Louie quite a bit these last two days. We had a blast prank calling people using the Ahnuld soundboard. We recorded some of the calls but they were bad quality so we just deleted them. That was ok though because we had our fun. Whenever we went to the Hess station for breakfast the guy gave me a pepperoni pizza and a drink for the same price as a cheese pizza. It was awesome, I was all amazed, that guy made my day. We were gonna take a road trip to Orlando to see House of 1000 Corpses after we found out that was the only place it was playing within a 80 mile radius. We looked up a map and everything, but we realized it would take like 20 dollars to do that, and we didn't have 20 dollars. Good thing I was able to find it on Kazaa... So it finished dowloading and I am about to watch it. I'm not even five minutes into it and the phone rings (this is like 2:00 am mind you). I pick it up and it's Jesseca. What a surprise. Most of the time she never stays up past 9, 10 if i'm lucky. So it's crazy that she's even up this late, but awesome nevertheless. I am so glad she called me because I was getting really bored and I had just started thinking about her. It was cool as hell basically. She sounded like she was having fun at the party (or whatever it was), and that's good, i'm happy for her. She had to go because the cell phone was running out of batteries, but that's alright because i'll be seeing her tomorrow (well ya know, unless something goes terribly wrong). That brings me up to right this moment, it's 3:13 in the morning and i'm gonna try to watch House of 1000 Corpses. This should be good because whenever you watch scary movies while falling asleep your psyche is extra sensitive and these horrific images get burned into your brain; in your delirious exhaustion filled state you confuse your reality with the movie's reality and it seems like this stuff is really happening, and it makes the experience all the more terrifying. I may be scarred for life and not be able to watch horror movies anymore, but hey, that's what happens.

      How does a  10  day weekend sound to you? Because it sounds great to me. I'm so happy and excited about this that i'm wide awake even though I stayed up till 2:30 last night, and i'm not hungry even though I didn't eat anything this morning. What a glorious day. Whatever man (or woman) came up with Spring Break deserves a cookie, or even better, a donut.   A Very Special Sports Report, Nobody Can Stop The Lakers:  If I had any doubt that the Lakers would win the [NBA] championship for the fourth time in a row, it was completely erased last night when they beat the Sacramento Kings, they're supposed biggest rival, decisively. I have been convinced. I have seen the light. Unlike the last three years, if the Lakers don't win it all, I will be shocked and awed. When it comes down to it and you give up all your futile hopes of your favorite team winning a championship you will realize that Shaq and Kobe, and the rest of the Lakers, are simply unstoppable. Shaq is clearly the X- Factor in the NBA that no other team can even come close to. There is an equal to Kobe Bryant, at least talent wise, in the form of Tracy Mcgrady, but nobody (and I mean nobody on the face of the earth) can even come close to playing the same level of basketball as Shaquille O Neal. He is the dominator. He will dunk it on anyone in the league, and for the times when he gets double or triple teamed, he can just shoot it (and make it). His free throws have even been improved to an impressive level. Normally I would be the last person to admit this, but there can be no argument about it. Shaq can't lose. Not only do the Lakers have Shaq and Kobe, who could beat everybody on their merits alone, but everyone else on the team is good too. Many might not think so, but these people are winners. Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Devean George, Robert Horry, and even Mark Madsen, they all know what it takes to win games, and what is most important - championships. They do their best to do their jobs to help their team, and that's more than what a lot of guys could say. Putting it all together, we have Phil Jackson as the coach and mastermind behind the whole operation. How insanely ridiculous is that? Phil Jackson, a well proven winner and the man who coached the Chicago Bulls to not one, but six NBA championships, is coaching the Lakers. Now that has to be one of the most absurd things i've ever heard of. Taking this all into consideration I would put the Laker's chances of winning it all this year at 99%. That means that everyone else has only a 1% chance of winning, combined. I am not even exaggerating here. If the Lakers played the best that they could every game of the regular season then they wouldn't lose 1 game, not even 1. Instead they like to toy with everyone else and lose a few games to get their hopes up. This season they took an even greater risk by falling far behind .500 in order to make it more exciting, they made it seem like the other teams have a chance. But let's face it, no other team has a chance, unless you consider 1% a good chance. I don't see why anybody even cheers for other teams in the NBA. It's a joke, everyone else is just there for entertainment, but nobody can compete with the Lakers. You may say "But oh, Tim Duncan...", "No, Kevin Garnett...", "Hey, Tracy Mcgrady..." What people who say stuff like that fail to realize is that those guys are good players, but they aren't winners. They may seem pretty good most of the time, but when it comes down to crunch time in the NBA finals they won't be the ones to make the game winning shot, Shaq and Kobe will. One could argue that those guy's stats are much better than either Shaq or Kobe, and they score more points, or they get more rebounds, or maybe even that they are the MVP of the league. Well MVP is just a fancy title that they give to these losers who have no hope of beating the untouchable Lakers, and Shaq said it all when he said "the only stat that counts is the W." Period. And no, I don't care about the Sacramento Queens.  I can be very convincing can't I? Well there's something I learned from school - how to write a persuasive essay... I've kind of worn myself out with all that talk about basketball so I will resort to citing two more things I found on the EGM message boards. They aren't as funny this time, but I thought they were still cool, or at the least something to make you go hmm.  "Extending the war into Iraq would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq...Exceeding the U.N.'s mandate would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the U.S. could still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land." -George Bush Senior said this back when he was president about the Gulf War, it was in an issue of Time Magazine-  I have been "Playing with Power", then "Super Power", then I "Got Into It". I did "Get N or Get Out" too, and as I speak I am "Born to play", as well as "Living in my world, and playing in Sony's." -Some kid making a joke about the past slogans for various game consoles-  The first one is ironic because what he said is exactly what is happening today, and I dunno, it's kind of funny. The second one is probably only cool if you have been playing video games for your whole life, like me. Although it is missing some major ones that I can't think of at the moment, it does bring back the memories for more than a few people.  There's a substitute teacher up in here and she is wigging out on us because we're playing rap music out loud and playing the Arnold Schwarzenegger sound clips over the speakers. It's funny as hell. First Arnold goes "I hope you left room for my fist because I am going to ram it into your stomach!" and she's like "I'm going to write everyone in the class up if you guys keep doing this." Then he's like "You sonofabitch!" and she's like "Oop, I warned ya, now you're all in big trouble." So we distract her by playing some rap music all loud and she goes "I will not tolerate this bologny. Rap music has to be the biggest disgrace to music in...centuries!" Then, here's the good part, an Arnold clip plays where he says "Stop whining!" Oh how I laugh at the craziness that is going on in this biotch.  I will end this with the funniest thing i've heard in a long while. Jesseca was telling me about how she was watching Sorority/ Fraternity Life the other night, that's where I got this. There's a guy on the show that is a virgin and on one of the episodes he gets lucky with the stripper and has sex for the first time, and (get this) in the backround they play the song from  the Jeffersons  where it goes "I finally got a piece of the piiiiiie!" L O freakin L man, that is brilliant.

      I have come to discover that I must be some kind of mutant, because my peripheral vision is off the charts! I can even see behind me if I turn my head ever so slightly, it's very cool. What a weird thing to talk about right off the bat...  I was like totally falling asleep during first block. I usually stop myself from doing that at all costs because I like that class, but i'm just tired so I try to stay awake and pay attention. I just gave up today though and quit trying to feign consciousness. I was all laying there with my face in my book wiggin out (hardcore sleeping). I'm surprised nobody noticed, or maybe they did, because I would have no way of knowing. I slept for the rest of the period and it was really crazy when I walked out of there because I was still half asleep, I must've looked like death warmed over. I don't know why I was so tired, I didn't even go to sleep late last night. Maybe it was because Mr. Phillips wasn't there (he's on his honeymoon), and Mrs. Applebee is ugly and boring. Yeah, that's probably it.  So let's see, what has happened to me recently? I had late night conversation with Justin the other night, it was like three in the morning, but it was cool. I went and saw  Phone Booth  with Jesseca on Friday. I didn't think I liked the movie when we were leaving the theater, but the more I think about it, the better it seemed. So I dunno, it was pretty good. I heard from a reliable source that some kid said he was gonna beat another man's shit. Now that is hilarious, think about it. "Hey! I'm gonna beat your shit!" Hardy har har.  Now for a couple of interesting/ funny (I thought) quotes that I found while surfing the EGM message boards:  Fear can sometimes be a useful emotion. For instance, let's say you're an astronaught on the moon and you fear that your partner has been turned into Dracula. The next time he goes out for the moon pieces, wham!, you just slam the door behind him and blast off. He might call you on the radio and say he's not Dracula, but you just say, "Think again, bat man." -Jack Handy-  I can just feel my I.Q. go down 20 points each time I start up the disk and it's not exactly a good feeling. But hey, if you like football you should be able to stand it, but that's just my opinion. I don't know why I feel stupider playing the game. Maybe it has something to do with people running around smashing into each other and yelling at the other team who can run into the other team better and make grunts and clicking sounds reverting to their primal instincts of yelling, grunting, and beating the pulp out of the opposition, then making a franchise out of it with stupid people who smear colored paint all over their bodies and tip cars over and beat the pulp out of each other and so on and so on... I just don't find that entertaining, or any video games based off this activity entertaining. Each game feels the same and is the same to me.  -Some kid talking Madden 2003 and other sports games-  I laughed my ass off when I first read those, i'm not sure why but they just struck me funny I guess. Especially the second one.  And i'm spent.

      I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad, the dreams in which i'm dying are the best i've ever had.  No i'm not going to kill myself or anything, that's a line from a song that I like. Whether that means i'm crazy or not is up for debate, but I don't think so, I just like the song...   What's my story for today? Hmm, it's pretty easy. I came, I saw, I slept. I went to school in an awkward mood because I stayed up until three in the morning the night before playing  Final Fantasy 7 . Cool game by the way, i'm almost done with it. Anyways, I was stumbling around school and laughing at everyone and everything. This has come to be a familiar routine for me, I think i've had just about enough of school for one year. Chris and Mike came home with me today. We fooled around with some playing cards and laughed at small stupid things for an hour or so, then Chris's mom picked them up. Jesseca called me soon after and we talked forever, like an hour and a half. It was a pretty good conversation I thought, even though it was about some odd things at times. It's always like that, and I never cease to enjoy it. After that my memory fails me, but I think I fell asleep not too much later. I slept until like 10:30 at night. I woke up, walked to the kitchen, and listened to my mom tell me how she's been waiting all day for me to wake up so I could eat. She also told me not to stay up too late and to take a shower, I did neither. So I ate the scraps they saved for me, 2 fish patties and some mashed potatoes. Then I talked to my sister in the kitchen for a long time about some kids at her school. We went to my room because she wanted to look in my yearbook for some people she knew. We ended up looking at the yearbook for about 30 minutes. She laughed at a picture of someone crazy looking or pointed out someone that was pretty, and I explained that I knew them, and told her their story. That's how it went pretty much the whole time. That brings me to right about now. It's 12:30 am and i'm sitting here writing in my journal and listening to music.   I'm in a weird mood so all i'm listening to is either sad songs or love songs because both kinds are usually slow and heartfelt, which is the kind of stuff i'm in the mood for. I downloaded that song on Ricky's journal  Goodnight Elizabeth  by the Counting Crows, it's pretty good. I like it when people put songs that they've been listening to on their journals because then I get to hear some of their favorite songs and I usually end up liking them as well. The good news is that's not the only good song i've discovered tonight. No no, the real treat was found in the traffic section of Kazaa, freshly downloaded (by my sister assumedly). It's a badass country song by Blake Shelton called  Austin I Still Love You . To be honest, i've never heard of the guy or the song in my life. So I didn't really know what to expect when I started listening to it, but it turned out pretty darn good. I loved it actually, everyone should listen to it. I don't know if this is a popular or well liked song among the country music circles, but I sure like it. It might even be a little old, and if so people will probably be like "man that song's old", but I don't care about how old a song is. It's new to me you farts.  Now it is time for me to listen to more music and then go to bed, goodnight pals.

      Mmmm, i'm hungry, what shall I eat? Let's see here, we have Pepperoni Pizza Rolls, Pepperoni Flavored Hot Pockets, or microwaveable Pepperoni Pizzas. What a selection. I swear that's all we have to eat in this house, lol.  I stayed home from school today for the third day in a row.  Yes Jesseca, I didn't go to school.  The funny thing is i'm not sick. I was totally expecting to go to school, but instead I went to the doctor. Hey, no complaints here. I know i'm gonna be royally screwed when I go back to school tomorrow, but meh, that's not until tomorrow. So I went to the doctor for no reason and I was kind of worried that she would just be like "uh...you're not sick..." and that's pretty much what she said, except she said it in doctor terms. It was funny. I always feel weird going to the doctor anyways because I still go to the kid doctor and when I go there's always like six little toddlers running around in the play area, and there I am all large, they're probably thinking "what is this kid doing here?" Oh well, those little kids can bite the big one for all I care.  I have a whole free day ahead of me and I have a couple of things I need to do. For one I need to finish reading  A Man Like Mac , a book that Chris threw at me when I was leaving his house one day. From the back of the book it sounded kind of interesting so I decided I would read it. I started it last night at like 12:30 and I read for like three hours. I'm more than halfway through it right now, so I should be able to finish it up in about 3 more hours. I'll save judgement on it until then, but right now it's not looking very promising. It's either shorter than I thought or I can read faster than I used to be able to. Probably the latter because it's a three hundred pager. It is a little small in dimensions though, so I dunno (but I also don't care). After I finish reading that book I think I might take the time and update my website with some links and crazy writings of mine, like "Da Script" 1 & 2. It's about time.  About my journal yesterday, the part about the S-10: I don't know when everyone started hating S-10s with a passion, but damn, a lot of people wigged out about me not getting one. I would rather get an F-150 for sure, but I don't know if i'll be able to because of money. The main reason I would get an S-10 is because it's the only thing in a first car price range that is a little cool - that I can think of. I didn't want to say Ranger because Louie already has one, so I figured I would get the Chevy counterpart. Plus I saw some really sweet ones on cardomain.com directly before writing the journal, so that influenced me greatly, along with my urge to quote the kid who once said "pure chevy power." I would really like to get a Corolla, but I don't know if I can do that either. If you guys really care that much, you can choose my car for me, because I don't like anything besides Vipers, Ferraris, F-350s, Dakotas, Lancer Evolutions (which they don't have in America, so you must import them for around 50,000 dollars), Bentlys, and other stuff like that. Give me some suggestions, and if it's cool i'll force my parents to get it. That is all.

      It's awesome rocking the hoodie sweatshirt on a warm day. You can't even argue about that one.  I have discovered the secret to success: owning a Chevy S-10. Pimped out or not, those things are the shiznit. I won't say i'm definitely getting one for fear of being one of those assholes that say they're getting a certain type of car and talk about it all the time then change their mind at the last minute, but I will say that it is the car (or truck I should say) I hope to get. Everyone loves trucks, and after careful study I have determined that S-10's are the ones that people like the most. For me it's not a follow the crowd sort of thing, it's more of a S-10's kick all kinds of ass kind of thing. The main benefit of having an S-10 is being able to say "pure Chevy power" all the time, I look forward to it.

      I'm sick, again. And I stayed home from school, again. It's not all bad though, I did get to beat the wonderful  Jak and Daxter . One last thing before I end this tiny, tiny journal. I'm lovin all the April Fools jokes that everyone on the internet (and elsewhere) came up with. I remember last year's very well and I didn't think anyone would try to compete with them because they were so good, but they did. My thanks go to all the people who like to celebrate the great April Fools day, it's one of my faves as well.

      What a goofy day... Good thing I know that loneliness can be fun; otherwise I would be wiggin out. There's nobody here but me. My parents rode out on the hog and Amber and Chas are with Karley and Dan, respectively. I'm just chillin out / making a cd with the Bittersweet Symphony on it, because I love that song. I do miss Jesseca, but I called her three times at 4, so I don't know what she's doin. I fixed my Kazaa (yes!), and as a result I am revitalized through the joy of music. I am supposed to go to work with my dad tomorrow, even though I didn't really volunteer to do it. He just accused me of picking my hours and I gave in. LoL, my dad cracks me up. I have these movies to watch but I don't know if i'll get the chance to do it. I'll probably just watch them tonight and sacrafice the luxury of on-the-job alertness because I stayed up too late. I don't even know if that made sense... It doesn't matter either way, because i'm leavin. Goodbye.

      "I hate loosing," that's what i've been saying over and over for these last 10 minutes. Not really, but you can imagine what it would be like if I did... I've been playing this tard-ass hockey game all morning and I went like 4-10-1 for the season so I just gave up. The difficulty was set on medium and I still got my ass handed to me very badly. Now I guess i'm forced to put the difficulty level down one notch to "easy," and absolutely destroy every single team that stands in my way. I can personally guarantee that I won't lose one game. Not that that's cool or anything (I know I suck at the game), it will just make me feel better.  Compared to today, last night was crazy as a freakatron. Actually, compared to any day last night was weird. I hung out with Louie all day and we had a bunch of misadventures. I'm not sure where to begin really, since it's hard to remember how the day started out, but i'll try. Oh yeah, and I will bar out all the boring stuff, because, well, it is boring...  We started off the day doing some skits for CRYK; the likes of which include dancing around a fire and putting a hot knife through butter. Before I knew it, Jesseca called me from work and we made plans to hang out after she got off of work (in about an hour). So Louie and I went to his house to get some money, plus it would burn some time. Afterwards we went to Tony's and rented some movies, because I told Jesseca I was going to do so. I ended up walking out with  Hellraiser II ,  Footloose , and  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon  in hand. A pretty good selection I thought. When I got home I called Jesseca and nobody answered. I waited like 20 minutes until I tried again. This time her little sister picked up and wouldn't let me talk to her. I got all mad after that so Louie called twice claiming to be different people and one of the times her mom picked up and said she got in trouble for backtalking or something. I didn't really buy it, but whatever. Even if nobody wants to give me an explanation as to why I can't hang out with my girlfriend after we made plans already, there was not much else I could do about it. I got over that pretty quickly because I figured there was no use dwelling over the unfortunate. As the alternative to my prior plans, I ventured with Louie out to Cody's house in OBC. I'm still not sure who this Cody girl is, I guess it's some 8th or 9th grade chick who's sister was getting her system wired up by Louie. In any case, it ranked pretty high in the craziness factor. The tall skinny Brandon Smith was there along with some other queefnob, and they were both wiggin out. They asked if Louie's system was loud and he said "louder than you can handle." Louie then took one of the little gweets for a ride around the block to show him how loud it was and when the kid came back he was wiggin out about how sweet Louie's car was. He also thought Louie had NOS, and I laughed at that. I laughed at them some more and stole a knife from that girl's car and then we left. We were getting some gas at the Valero gas station when Louie started talking to some random kooks. They said they were looking for girls, so Louie made fun of them for looking in this part of town. He then offered to show them to a place where they could find some -- Oceanwalk. The kid's car was a souped up Honda Prelude, and it was admittedly badass. Besides that though, the duo had nothing going for them. They were wearing faded clothes, bobo shoes, and frankly, they were crazy looking. Not that I am an authority on fashion or anything, but come on, they were wiggin. Perhaps worst of all, they were from Chicago. Actually it's not that bad there, that was just a lame attempt to make one of those things they call jokes. But anyway, the drive to Oceanwalk was a fun one. Mostly because we saw Jose (the Angela Chieppa lover), and he tried to race us. He almost crashed into some car while switching lanes and it was just funny to see him try to compete. He probably didn't realize that the Chicago maniacs were packin NOS. When we got to Oceanwalk we talked to them for like 2 seconds and parted ways. We saw them again like 5 minutes later and we ran. While I was running I yelled, "I'm from Chicago, HAHAHA!" really freakin loud and they were way closer than I thought so they probably heard me. If so, they didn't say anything, because we talked to them one more time and they just shook our hands and stuff. I didn't really wanna touch their hands, but oh well, what're ya gonna do? When we were goin back to the car I saw Amanda and Ian (don't know their last names but they're Jesseca's friends). I was hoping I didn't see Jesseca there, because that would totally contradict what her mom said. Thankfully I didnt, but I did see her amigos. After that fiasco with those fags we were in the mood to ride around the boardwalk area and flaunt the bass heavy system. We did that for maybe 20 minutes before these girls pulled up and yelled some shit at us. It turned out Louie knew them so they said to meet us at the Valero station. They wanted to get drunk, but they had to be home in an hour (and I don't drink...), so we just got in their car and went for a ride. The two girls were Sabrina Goodner and Erin Love. Sabrina has been in a few of my classes, but I never talked to her. Erin I didn't know at all; I wouldn't even know her name if Louie didn't tell me it. Back to the story though: when we were riding around Margot and her gang pulled up beside us and asked who was in the back seat. It was funny as hell because Sabrina was like Louie Garafolo and Dave. They were like "Dave who?" and she was like "...Dave." She forgets that nobody knows who the hell I am, lol. We continued the drive out to Williamson, where we turned onto some crazy dirt road. I never expected it to be the craziest rally trail ever, but it was. It was so crazy when we rode through it because there were large ass bumps and dips galore and we were ridin out in a (Honda??) Tiburon. The front end was getting annhilated as it smashed into the ground like 20,000 times. We were going pretty fast too, and all the while listening to "Hey kitty kitty" (that song by the 69 Boys or whatever). Needless to say, it was the most insane thing i've done in a very long time. The fact that we were in the back seat of a car with some kooks that I didn't know made it much cooler than it should have been. After that funnyness we went back to Louie's car and went home to my house. We decided we weren't finished yet so we took a walk up to 7-11 to get some food or something. On the way there we nigger knocked Justin's old house to an extreme. I walked up there and screamed "I AIN'T NEVER SCARED!!!" at the top of my lungs and banged on the door like a madman with both fists. I'm usually not one for exaggeration, but it was the wildest thing ever. At 7-11 we got a buttload of snack food and some Amp to keep us awake. You will never guess who pulled up when we were eating outside on the curb -- the infamous Chris Sox and the aforementioned Ian. At first I wasn't sure if it was them because i've seen that kid once and the other kid barely twice, but I am 99% sure now because they said "yeah that's him," as they walked by. The fags didn't say anything, but I laughed at their appearance. Out of all the kooks in the world that I could see in the parking lot of 7-11, I had to see them. It was funny though. Me and Louie then went home and dropped off our stuff so we could go niggerknocking some more. Before it was all said and done, we got Wendy Naumann  and  Tommy Eckenrode's old houses. It was pretty funny. We were pretty much done after that, but we couldn't get to sleep forever because we drank that Amp. We pranked called Chris 3 times and wigged out. I guess that got all of the hyperness out of our system because we fell asleep shortly after that. And that, my friends, is game over.  Sorry for that long ass trash. I know it was longer than fuck itself and more boring than your grandma's stories, but I felt like talking about my day for once, and this one just happened to be really eventful. I apologize once again for wasting your time, because I know that was dumb. But what I wanna know is, where is Jesseca at? I miss her.

      Well, that sucked. A long ass post of mine just submerged into nothingness. I guess it's kind of funny though. If you want you can  urlLink  check this out . It's pretty long and it doesn't get funny until near the end, but trust me - it's worth the read. I laughed my arse off... but maybe i'm just tired. Either way, I liked it.

      LoL, go to this funnyness --  urlLink The Basic Procedure for LiveJournal Commenting  Also, the proper spelling of draws (the way that Shannon used it) would be drawers, and it means underpants...  I'm most likely NOT going to write in this over the weekend, because I usually don't. Just to let you know. I'm going to see Bruce Almighty tonight (as long as Jesseca isn't deathly ill) and then i'm going to a baseball game tommorrow. Both with Jesseca, both should be fun. I suppose there's more to say, but since school is ending I don't feel like being here. It's pretty crazy that it's almost over, but oh so sweet. Time for me to blow this popsicle stand.

      Yesterday was probably the best day of the year for Justin because the date was 5/20, his favorite numbers.Yesterday was awesome for me, however, because I got to hang out with Jesseca all day. Chris wanted me to play basketball after school but I rode out. Now I am eating a taco flavored Hot Pocket. I'm not sure if these are new or what, but I freakin love em. The taste is so good. Oh yeah, and did I mention that I didn't go to school today? Yeah, I didn't. There was really no reason for this. I guess my parents couldn't take me or something, but hey, I'm not complaining. As a result of this staying home from school business, I got a couple things done. I mowed my lawn, cleaned my room, and updated my website with some trash. I slept too, but I don't know if that counts... Even though the new stuff on my website isn't so cool, everyone should probably check it out. There's a link right over yonder. It's been there forever, but if you didn't know, it's on the left sidebar. I need to do some homework now. Then I'm going to finish reading my book, beat Mario, and take a shower; not neccessarily in that order. I guess there's a basketball game on tonight so maybe i'll watch that. Although I am bummed that the Pistons lost last night... Tonights game will be better though because I like both teams. Either way, I love Jesseca more than you. (And your momma too.)

      Chip Chip Cheerio. I said that as I left my house this morning. Then I listened to  the Strokes , because they rock.  All these fags in here are talking about Tekken. I don't know what they're saying about it exactly, but I bet it's some bragging about how they rule at it. They don't want to ram with me though. I know they don't want to. Basically, "you want to ram with me!?" (in crazy Justin voice). When Louie and I were playing Blitz yesterday he was like, "I'm gonna write about this in my journal." That's laughable, I was just like, "you're gonna lose." You did lose, Louis, so go ahead and talk about it.  After English class tomorrow I will be all caught up. I haven't been that way like all year, so it will be awesome. I am also at the last level in Mario Sunshine, so i'll beat that one tonight. It might take me all night to do it, but once I taste blood there is no doubt that I will beat a game. I'm almost near the end of the book i'm reading too (embarassment holds me back from saying the name of it), so this is craziness. One more thing -- Jesseca, why are you burning the Ataris' cd? That sucks man. I usually don't care about the pirating of music because it doesn't matter very much. I really don't care when it's crazy songs from the past or some new pop singer who you know will be played out in a year at most, but the Ataris, come on now. I will let it go since you are my favorite girl in the world, but to all you other people who do this, stop being fartheads. I don't like it when people take money from such a good band. Do they have no morals, do they not respect anything or anyone? Maybe it's just me, but I think good cds should be bought, not burned. That's how it should be done. I can't ask anyone to not burn the cds of people I happen to like, but if you like someone, buy their cd, don't rip them off like that. It's not cool, that's all I have to say... Now i'm gonna go play pachinko. By the way, what the hell is pachinko?  I'm coming over today Jesseca.

       I'm strong in my convictions and don't you forget it.   So I saw  The Matrix Reloaded  directly after school today and it was awesome. I was really hoping this one didn't suck, and I had a feeling it was going to. Good thing it didn't. The story has managed to once again blow my mind with its scope and depth, the action was breathtaking as I expected, and this sequel has even surpassed the original as far as i'm concerned. I am trying hard not to ruin anything for anybody, but I will say that it's worth your money, just go and see it. You can thank me later.  Um oh yeah and did I mention that the Lakers lost? Yep, in an event that is sure to turn the sports world upside down, the Spurs have toppled the three time defending world champion Lakers in game 6, in a very decisive manner; 110 - 82 was the final score. All I can say is wow. I never thought I would see it. Pigs must be flying, and i'm sure that hell has frozen over, because this is crazy. To top it off, half the Lakers team was crying towards the end of the game. What an amazing sight to see, a bunch of grown men crying over a basketball game, i'm glad I witnessed it. I would be surprised to see any one of them cry, but since it was Kobe Bryant himself, it made it all the more incredible to watch. Honestly, I laughed my butt off at these cryin kooks. I was glad to see that big Shaq didn't shed a tear. As Chris said, "He doesn't care." I do care though, i've hated those damn Lakers for a long time now and i'm happy to see them finally get thrashed for a change. Maybe that'll teach em.  Speaking of being thrashed, I seem to be on a hot streak with the videogames as of late. I nearly beat  Tekken Tag Tournament  at the arcade with only 1 credit. I got to the final boss and I had her beat, but she got me with some cheap blows near the end and I let it slip away. But still, winning 10 rounds in a row is not too shabby, especially after you consider that I accidentally picked my first character and was forced to use some kook the whole way through. To make up for it I have been beating down Louie left and right at all these games. I beat him at  Knockout Kings  twice in a row and then  Blitz  at my house once and then again today at the arcade. That's what happens when you challenge me. Just for everybody's info - I had great fun in each of the brutal beatings. You want some more Louie? Then  don't sing it, bo-ring it .

      Pistons won last night baby. Detroit What!  Mr. Phillips was wiggin out in 1st block today. He called some kid a schlepp for never learning to ride a bike. It was crazy and I laughed. Oh man, what a funny thing to call somebody. There are also no seniors here. Yesterday was supposedly their last day. It doesn't really matter to me because I didn't know very many of them, and the ones I did I don't care about. I just find it surprising that I will be in 11th grade next year. Despite all this craziness,  The Matrix Reloaded  still comes out today, and I will probably go to see it by myself around 4 or so. I always do this with big movies that I want to see a lot; I think it helps me concentrate and actually watch the movie, more so than when i'm with my friends. Louie will probably want to go though, so maybe he will come. He just better be quiet, because i'm gonna Justin out. I have 2 essays to write today too, but I will get those done because procrastination is no longer an option; no late work will be accepted after tomorrow. I'll just have to pound those out even though i'll be wiggin about The Matrix. I won't be seeing Jesseca as much as I planned this weekend, which sucks the chrome off of a trailer hitch. On the bright side, I will be able to finally beat Mario Sunshine, since playing it sporadically isn't cutting it. Good thing too, because i've had enough of that game already. It's time for me to obey the commands of this schlepp of a teacher who is also known as Mrs. Parlade. She's been badgering me to do something all day so I better go before she slaps my ass. Later fiends.

      Louie just informed me that some nigger dude slapped a female chink. It does not get much funnier than that.  Random kid who was near me and talking to his friend as I walked to lunch: I would only... if I was shit drunk. Me: Shit drunk is not a thing, you are wigging out. Kid: So? Me: So???! What the fuck. (Followed by me laughing.)  Now that I got that little anecdote out of the way, I will have a rambling session for the ages. Kind of like in that movie  Rules of Attraction  where the guy gives his fast talking and quick moving account of his trip to Europe. That was probably the coolest scene in that movie, it cracked me up. Haven't seen  Rules of Attraction ? Too bad... First of all, this girl next to me has put her book on top of my mouse cord once again. She hasn't done it in a long time, but this time she messed up for the last time. I'm gonna slap her ass in the face just like that nigger did to that chink. If she asks me the reason i'm gonna be like, "You put your book on my mouse and when you do that it takes away my full range of motions, and we all know what happens when you take away my full range of motions - I get angry, and you wouldn't like me when i'm angry. Yes that's a reference to  The Hulk  and yes i'm wigging out, but you can't talk because you just got slapped." Now, believe it or not, there are some other things on my mind. I don't even feel like I should mention this, but Jesseca signed off on me in a rude manner last night and wouldn't tell me what was bothering her, and I hate it when she does both of those things. The funny thing is I wasn't mad about it because I knew she was mad/ sad and if we were both that way then we would both be screwed. So I wrote her this long drawn out email trying to explain that I loved her and I would like to apologize about anything if it had to do with me. Basically that's all I was trying to say. That was directed towards you  Jesseca , if you happen to be reading this, and  I love you . Not to try and take away the sincerity of the current situation, but the show must go on. I finally had the privilege of watching  Doggy Fizzle Televizzle  last night after I downloaded it off Kazaa. For the uninformed, that is Big Snoop Dogg's new TV show, and it rocks your ass. If you haven't already seen it, that show is great. It was very funny to me, and it seems to bode well among my friends as well. The humor is definitely not for everyone, but I love the Snoop Dogg craziness. I especially liked the skit where he was teaching those second grade kids some crazy stuff, it was crackin me up. Everything else was cool too, making the show pretty good overall. I am a little worried about the kooks running out of ideas after this action packed foray into TV land, but if they can keep it up then it will turn out to be an awesome show indeed. The presentation actually looks considerably low budget, but I think that helps the gangsta style; you could even say i'm impressed by the freshness of it. Enough about that Dizzle Fo Shizzle My Nizzle :) I also stayed up late last night watching a very good basketball game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers. What a nerve wracking game, specifically near the end. It was almost exactly like the Kings - Lakers game 4 last year where Horry hit a three at the buzzer to win by one, but this time, he missed. Luckily for the Spurs, that shit went in and out, but he was wide open. This surprising Spurs win put the Lakers' backs against the proverbial wall, as they hold a 3-2 series deficit. Everyone still expects the Lakers to win it in 7, and although I can't disagree, I think you should always watch out for the underdog. In any case, these next two games (or game) should be exciting as hell. Last but certainly not least, I will talk about E3. If you don't know what E3 is, I don't blame you because it is rather obscure to people who aren't video game enthusiasts. The only thing it could really be compared to for me is Christmas. That's how big of a deal it is. It stands for Electronic Entertainment Expo and it is basically a convention where all the video game companies, hardware and software, come together and show off all their latest projects, make all their bombshell announcements, and otherwise cause mass histeria within the gaming scene. To me, that equates to games games games, and it's the time of year when everything video game related comes alive. There are all kinds of badass games that we previously knew nothing about being unveiled, and the ones we knew a little about are being playtested by editors who are passing their opinions on to us. Not only that but there are mountains of videos and screenshots and info on almost every game coming out within in the next 1, 2, 3, or even 4 years. It rocks shit. Justin and I were talking about how we wouldn't be able to read and see all this stuff even if we stayed up all night. And this is only the beginning. Right now we're just getting the early leaks of news, while the actual show begins on Friday. It's that crazy. However, I can imagine a lot of people not caring about any of this, so I will stop talking about it now. Besides, I think I have geeked out enough for one whole year. Don't fret though, there will probably be more geekiness to come as the week progresses and I freak out even more about videogames. Before you go, check out the crazy quote below (lol that rhymed). It never ceases to make me laugh when said out loud, so go ahead and say it out loud...then laugh. Then leave my site fucker.  "You guys wanna smoke some drugs?" - the skinny kook from  Road Trip

      If I voted for Al Gore back in the presidential election of 2000, I would be pretty mad. I'm talkin Pre Menstrual Syndrome mad, because even though the man I voted for got the majority of the votes, he did not win. As for why I'm talking about the 2000 election, I don't really know. I thought about it last night out of nowhere, because i'm just cool like that. Oh yeah, and if anyone thinks I like Al Gore or hate Bush or something - you're wrong. I just have an odd sense of humor, everyone should know this by now...  A good man once said "Great writing is clear thinking made visible," and KoolKellyBelly's LiveJournal is the total opposite of this assessment, seriously. Last night I read it for the first time and it was the weirdest thing i've read in a while. There was like zero use of capital letters at the beginning of sentences (if there was any sentences...), no punctuation whatsoever, and a bunch of jibber jabber that didn't make very much sense. I could barely read most of it due to lack of continuity, and I lost my place several times in those gigantic masses of words. Paragraphs were invented for a reason, use them. I also advise her to not write so much when it is about nothing. It's all about the quality, not quantity. There is some funny stuff to be had in there as well, but not the good funny. She talks about doing some insane stuff to Matt Tower because he treats Jenna bad, and it's all elaborate and crazy. If I were him I would tell her to stay up out my bizzness / bizznass repeatedly, Ludacris style. There is also some talk about a dream she had, which is the thing that inspired me to write this the most, because it is caraazzzyy. I will stop wigging out about it now and let you see for yourself what i'm talking about. If you want to check it out, go to Livejournal.com and search for Poopoocaca. But be careful, reading it will change your life. And Kelly, if you're reading this, there was no offense meant towards ya, but your journal is crazy. You can talk trash about mine all you want, because I don't care.  Does anyone know who it was that said "I'm as bad as I wanna be" ? Because I sure don't. I'm thinkin it was either Johnny B Bad (the wrestler) or Prince (the crazy asshole), but it was probably neither... you see the kind of boredom that I am forced to suffer through. I have debates about the craziest trash in the world. This is probably why everyone thinks I smoke marijuana.

      I think I'm cute, I know I'm sexy. I've got the looks, that drive the girls wild. I've got the moves, that really move em. I send chills, up and down their spines. I'm just a sexy boy. I'm not your boy toy, i'm just a sexy boy. I make em hot, I make em shiver. Their knees get weak, whenever I'm around. They see me walk, they hear me talk. I make em feel, like they're on cloud nine. I'm just a sexy boy. I'm not your boy toy, I'm just a sexy boy... Eat your heart out girls, but keep your hands off the merchandise, because I belong to Jesseca.   LoL, i'm just kiddin. That was simply a bastardized version of  Shawn Michaels - Sexy Boy .

      I kind of skipped out of all the Mother's Day activities today and yesterday and I probably should be feeling bad about it, but right now i'm not really sweatin it. I wasn't in a good mood at all, so these people shouldn't expect me to try and make other people happy. It's alright though because nobody has said anything to me about it, maybe later.  I'm pretty sure I have some school work to be done today, I just don't know what it is i'm supposed to be doing. It's something to do with English; I think I have to write an essay, a journal, and do a couple of worksheets. Sounds like a lot of work...because it is. That's what happens when you delay until the last minute, you don't do it at all and end up having to make it up later. I know from experience. There is some good news though - Mitsubishi is releasing its brand new Lancer Evolution VIII here in the U.S., making it the first time the Lancer Evolution series has ever been released in the U.S. Oh yeah, and did I mention that Lancer EVOs are my favorite kind of car? This ain't no watered down version either, I will tell you that right now. From what i've seen from videos and pictures and from what i've read as well, that car is fuckin awesome. I definitely wanna get one, but it will probably take a while since they cost around 30,000 dollars. I will start saving up now.  "Don't worry, be happy. I give you my phone number and when you worry call me, I make you happy." - Bobby McFerrin, who later killed himself.

      As recently as three hours ago I was not into movies; it had gotten to the point where it was a struggle to just sit through them without my wind wandering off on some tangent. I'm not sure why this was, as I have been into them very much in the past. I guess I got caught up in other things such as the excitement of filming of our new video, the dullness of going to school, and the thrill hanging out with Jesseca. Whatever the reason was, I just seemed to have lost interest in them. That all changed today after I watched  Chasing Amy . I don't know how I went so long without seeing this movie. Especially since I have been a Kevin Smith fan for at least 6 years now. In any case, this movie has breathed a breath of fresh air into me. I have once again figured out why I love the movies.  That being said, I have three little reviews for the movies that I rented from Tony's on Wednesday (yes, they are overdue). I will go in order from worst to best because I figured I would do as that lady says in that one song and "save the best for last." Here we go.   C.H.U.D. -  Oh my god, what a steaming pile of dog doodoo this is. If you take the worst idea you can think of, put it into movie form, and inject it with the downright ugliest actors you have ever seen, all the cheesiness you can muster, the worst filming locations in the world, and horrible directing, you get this horrifying disaster of a movie. This is very likely the most unwatchable and least entertaining movie ever made. Never in my wildest dreams could I imagine that a movie could be this bad.  Steel Magnolias -  I didn't really watch this movie because being in the presence of Jesseca fills me with joy and makes me unable to pay attention to such things as TV sets, but I did look at the screen for a lot of it and I even followed some of the story. What I took from it was this: There are some movies made solely for the female audience, and this is one of them. I think I would like this movie and think it was great, funny and sad... if I was a girl. But alas, I am not. So I may sound sexist or whatnot by saying this (and I assure you that i'm not), but this is a chick-flick in its purest form. Not that there is anything wrong with that. And make no mistake about the placing of this film in the paragraph, this movie is a hell of a lot better than  C.H.U.D. , even to guys.  Chasing Amy -  I think I have already made it quite clear that I liked this movie, so that is a given. Now I will just tell you some of the reasons why. First of all I loved the directing. I'm not talking about nice cinematography, flashy special effects, or intriguing camera angles. Rather, I was impressed by the more simplistic things about the directing. This should come as no surprise; seeing that Kevin Smith was behind it. The sheer number of jokes and the overall depth and volume of his movies overwhelmes me, and the simple fact that he accomplishes such feats in writing and film-making makes me aspire to be as good as him someday. Enough ass kissing for now though, and back to the narrower subject of  Chasing Amy . There was a good story to be told, and it involved plenty of comic books, mentions of dick and fart jokes, and Jay and Silent Bob. Additionally, that pair of kooks, coupled with the ever hilarious antics of Jason Lee, provided a satisfying comedic experience that had me laughing my ass off on more than a few occasions. And perhaps best of all,  Chasing Amy  appealed to the mushy wussy inside of me, and if you know me well, that is a pretty big slice of the Davey Boy pie. To sum it up, these are the kinds of movies I like, and as far as movies go, this is what's it all about.

      *Guy walks into gay bar and sees a bunch of half nude male strippers dancing all over poles and stuff* He Responds, "Man this is gay as hell!"  Oh man that craziness gets me every time. My sister always tells me about that and I laugh my face off. I think it's from the movie  Chasing Amy . I think i'm gonna rent that tonight because it's the only Kevin Smith film I haven't seen, and all the other ones are sweet, so ya know. I'm also getting  Steel Magnolias  because it is Jesseca's favorite movie, meaning it is probably good. If not then I still need to see it so I can make my own judgement on it. Since the deal is 3 movies for 3 days for 3 dollars, this leaves me room to get one more movie. I'm not sure what that will be yet, but the leading candidate is  C.H.U.D.  because it has the craziest name ever and I have been wanting to know what it's about for a long time. All this movie watching should fun because I have been bored as a bow-legged nutlicker for most of this week and all of these movies will probably be crazy as hell (read: not good).

      Me: I am the President of the United States of America. Fucklick McDinner: Dave, you are ear delicious. Me: Whaaaaaaaat?  You see that conversation up there? Yeah, it never happened. But my shoe is untied and I am wearing the smallest shirt known to mankind, if that counts.  What is with me hating everything people love and loving everything people hate? I don't know about the second half of the question, as I can't think of any examples of me loving some craziness... The first part however, is right on target. I went and saw X-Men 2 on Friday with Jesseca and I thought it sucked. Not only did I think it sucked, I thought it was boring, slow paced, and confusing. I wasn't alone on this one either, Jesseca agreed with me. I'm starting to think that maybe we didn't watch it close enough, because everyone under the sun seems to have loved it. Justin wigged out about it hardcore, so did pretty much everyone on the EGM boards, as did Howard Stern and his gang. It even has a rating close to 8.0 on IMDB.com, and that means it probably doesn't suck. I still haven't heard anyone share my opinion on it. Oh well, screw them for now, but I will watch it again sometime and make my final decision. It deserves at least another look since it has gotten all this positive feedback. Oh yeah, and while we're on the subject - Coldstone is the gayest trash of all time.  I can't say much about what i'm doing after school today because it involves CRYK, and that is a top secret project, as i'm sure you've figured out already. I can tell ya something though. If not a lot of stuff goes down today I will spend some time making additions to my website, and have up around 8 new pages before the night is over. That will be cool if I get it done. But for now I leave.

      Lakers win. It looks like those pair of wins by the T-Wolves was a fluke. They're pussies.  Watched the movie version of Tokilla Mockingbird today. It sucked a big gullet compared to the book. I suppose that's to be expected, but I was still surprised. Nevertheless, I have a pretty easy day today. I already watched a movie in first. Next I have another movie to watch about the espanol craziness. In fourth we have a victory party (for the Iraqi massacre, Mrs. Kelly is a military lover), and that will rock everyone's bones. I will eat all the food even though I didn't bring anything of my own. I love doing that. The only block i'm worried about is this one. I've weaseled my way out of a fair amount of work, but i'm still being forced to do some stuff because the Programming Nazi has caught me on the internet like 10 times, so I have to mix it up a little. It's cool though because this class is almost over.  I'm really looking forward to seeing X-Men 2 tonight. I didn't hear much about it since I watched the first one over a year ago; it seemingly came out of nowhere. So it should be cool, but I won't be able to go if Jesseca's mom continues her insanity. That goon better realize that she's wiggin out...  Here's some funny junk from the EGM message boards. You can leave now if you only care about me, that way ya won't complain if this stuff isn't funny or whatever.

      I have some wacked out news for all you buttcrack lovers. Lucky you. Both of these stories involve slightly obscure actors, but I know who they are and I was shocked by this stuff. So without further adieu...  You know Casper from the movie Kids? His real name was Justin Pierce. He was also in Next Friday. He was the guy that worked at the record store, he wore a pink shirt and talked to the dog when he was high. Well he's dead. He hung himself in some hotel in Las Vegas shortly after filming Next Friday. I just found that out yesterday and I was wiggin out. It happened so long ago too. Why didnt I hear about this earlier? There's one more thing that I read about yesterday. You know the Dell guy? His name was Ben Curtis and he went by Steven in the Dell commercials. He's dead too... Just kiddin, he's still alive. He was just arrested and charged with possession of marijuana. I thought that was kind of funny. You could always tell the kid was a stoner.  We have a sub in here today so it's basically a free day, which is sweet. These kids were just arguing about all things associated with pro basketball. I didn't opt to give my 2 cents about anything, but I listened to their observations and even lauged at a couple of these kooks. Everyone had their different opinions on everything and nobody really agreed about much, so I can't say there was a big following of any of the teams. The one thing that stood out was when Mr. Gerald Pop and some other negro were arguing about who was better between Tracy McGrady or Allen Iverson and Pop said that " McGrady would put his nuts all over Iversons forehead " and "he would dunk all over his little ass." I will have to agree with him that one, McGrady is the MVP.  I just heard some obscene language coming out of the speakers of some computer behind me and I think "Oh man, that kid is gonna get in big trouble." Then I turn around to see the crazy ass substitute teacher at the computer playing all these clips of people cussing. The weirdest thing about it is that the guy is laughing histerically, he's like slapping his knee and stuff. It makes you wonder what this world is coming to... No it doesn't.

      Oh yeah baby. Me and Jesseca are goin to Disneyworld all day tomorrow. I am so crunked about this shit dawg (make sure not to take the thug wiggage too seriously though). Anyway, what I said is true. I got a whole bunch of these free tickets from my cousin Sherry a long time ago because she works at a radio station and I dunno, they give that kind of stuff out all the time. The funny thing is, out of the 6 that we had, only two of them didn't expire by now. Leave it to us [my crazy family] to ruin a perfectly good oppurtunity to scam Disney out of money. Since my birthday was on Tuesday, my parents decided that they would just let Jesseca and I go to Disney with the passes... However, backround stories are for wieners, so enough about that. These tickets are friggin park hoppers, and you know what that means. Yep, we get to have our choice of going to Magic Kingdom, MGM Studios, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, or any combination thereof. I'm thinkin we're not gonna go to Epcot because frankly, it's not really that cool there. Animal Kingdom seems to be out of the picture as well because I have never been there and I don't think we would have enough time to explore everything and go to the other places that we wanna go. So i'm thinkin we should start off at Magic Kingdom and go on the cool stuff all early, like Space Mountain and Splash Mountain, and maybe even the Dumbo ride. Then for the latter half of the day we can go to MGM Studios and ride the Tower of Terror (which is sweet! for a Disney ride). Also at MGM is the Star Wars ride, and everybody knows I love the Star Wars. I'm probably forgetting to mention a lot of cool stuff about Disney, and that's a good thing because i'll be surprised when I see it all tomorrow. Alright friends, I don't have much else to say, so I think i'm leavin now. Disney for life baby... and always remember -- If you're gonna be dumb, you gotta be tough.  P.S. (post script, I just learned that *wink wink*) I am supposed to be bringing 2 disposable cameras with me on our trip tomorrow, so hopefully I will get lots and lots of sweet pictures. Who cares if the quality is bad on those things? Not me, that's fo sho.

      "I need you now tonight; I fuckin need you more than ever." - the radically kooky singer in  Old School . That was definitely the saying of the night. You would have to see the movie to know what i'm talking about though. But if you did see it, oh my god, you would laugh your buttocks off your body.  Wow. People talk about stuff being weird all the time, but what they say is weird is not weird. I'll tell ya what's weird. Tonight was friggin  weird . That's what. It began with... actually I don't even know how it began, but I do know how it ended up. It ended up with Chris, Louie, Kelly, Taira, and myself all wigging out far into the morning hours. We have been up for the longest time now just doing nothing really except watching tv and talking about the music videos featuring black people. And of course there was a lot of talk about going to McDonalds to get some food, but that plan never came into fruition, humorously enough. Right now i'm at Louie's house struggling to stay awake as he peacefully sleeps in his room. We left Kelly's house about an hour ago for no reason really; we just didn't want to stay there. I imagine Chris and Taira are making out right about now; not that I care. Good for them I say. I don't think Louie would like the thought of that very much, but if not, then it's still ok because it will be no big deal when he wakes up in about 4 hours. Or maybe it will, but it's of no concern to me. I am kind of freaking out at the moment because I haven't slept in over 19 1/2 hours. Not even a little bit. It may not sound like very long, but believe me, it's enough to wear out the best of em. I am usually quite the nighthawk in these situations. Currently though, I see no point in staying awake. I do have one crazy story before I hit the hay for the night (well, for the morning). Chris and I were climbing across this chasm in Kelly's backyard in order to get to this other dock. We had to jump across a 2 foot gap and cross over a fence to get to the point where we were at. Even then it was fairly difficult because there was a ditch in front of the fence that we didn't know about at first; plus Chris had a cast on. Well anyway, after we slowly hauled along to this stone thingy, Louie came charging in behind us going all fast and jumping the gap like it was nothing. When he got to the fence, however, it was a different story. He was coming so fast and he didn't calculate the jump at all, and most importantly, he didn't see the ditch that laid in front of the platform that we were standing on. He came and jumped up, his foot caught on the fence, he busted his ass all over the place, and plunged elbow and hip first onto the hard cement below. At first the urge to laugh was almost overwhelming, but then we calmed down a little because he wasn't saying anything or moving at all. We were a little relieved when he got up and said some craziness, but mostly we just wanted to let out our bottled up laughter. And laugh we did. It was funny as a 1 legged monkey in a pie eating contest. Actually it was probably funnier than that if you can imagine a thing that could be so funny. End of story. I don't know if that read very funny, but that crap was hilarious in real life so I don't care. Alright, excuse my abrubtness, but I am leaving now. There is not much I have to say to any of you sardine cans. I do have something to say to Jesseca though, that is if she even reads this thing anymore...  Jesseca,  L is for the way you look at me.  O is for the only one I see.  V is very, very extraordinary E is for everything that I adore. and love, was made for me and you. (do do do dooby da do, whoo!)  I don't know if that's really how it goes, but I would be happy to find out and sing it to you for real anytime you want. Because like you, that song rocks. and as always, I love you. If you're reading this and you're not Jesseca, I can imagine how you might think (or wish) I am talking to you. That's simply not true though, I am talking to Miss Jesse. That's right, you heard me, I don't love you, I love Jesseca. I repeat --  I love Jesseca .

       The Wizard Of Oz  is the scariest movie ever made. I always used to get freaked out by the wicked witch of the west. Oh, and those owls and flying monkeys and even the freakin munchkins... they were all weirdos. The set of the movie is also extremely eerie, so that doesn't help the situation very much. Some people on the IMDB boards were talking about  Return To Oz  being much darker and stuff, so I need to rent that. I also need to watch the movie while listening to  Pink Floyd - The Dark Side Of The Moon , because everyone says that it is freaky. That's about it for now, but there's a lot of stuff on my mind, so i'll probably write a lot of stuff whenever I get the time. I'd say you can count on it tomorrow.

      Auto Response from Garaputo316: I am outside standing in the rain, legs spread wide with my arms stretched towards the sky. My hands are tightly gripping a mighty sword as I scream "I have the powwwweeeerrrr!!!!" You see, I am attempting to get struck by lightning so that it will seem as if I am the great He-Man. Even if it only lasts for a split second, it will be crazy as hell.  That's what my away message said for a little while today. You guys thought I was joking, I was serious. Except I had a pole and not a sword... but who the heck has a sword nowadays **coughJustincough**. I'm on some He-Man kick after watching  Masters of the Universe . The movie wasn't cool or anything, but when Dolph Lundgren yelled "I have the power!" I remembered the part from the old show where he would lift his sword in the air and lightning would strike it. Then I remembered when Charlie Wagner imitated it with a metal baseball bat and I laughed for a half hour straight. It was pretty crazy when I did it, but I had no luck with the lightning strike, sadly.  After that little endeavor I walked up to 7-11 to buy some Sour Bright Crawlers. I ended up staying there for a while reading an  Import Tuner  magazine. When I left the guy made fun of me for staying in there too long. I just laughed. It could've been worse; I could've stayed in there much longer, but I decided to leave before I seemed like a kook. Apparently I already looked like one. It's ok though, next time I will stay in there  all  day reading  all  the magazines and eating  all  the food -- and I won't pay for it. Wuahaha. Yep, I'm wiggin.  My dad said that we're going to work at 3 o clock this morning and I was like "AM?" and he's like "yeah." The funny thing is he's not playing around. That's how we do it around here yo. The workin don't stop till 7 in the mornin.

      I just got back from the movie store where I returned 3 movies and rented 4. Tony always seems grateful for the business, and he better be, because I swear my friends and I keep that guy in business. Anyway, there was this dude there who was talking trash about a bunch of sweet movies and he kept saying people couldn't act and stuff. He also said Renee Zelwegger wasn't in  Jerry Maguire , so yeah... he was wiggin out. He hardcore insulted  The Mothman Prophecies  and  The Matrix Reloaded  all in one breath and he almost got knocked out for that one. I held back the urge to say anything to him because I figured he was just mad 'cause he was bald, fat, and crazy. What a butthole though. People like that need to stay at home and bitch about their TV shows or something. At any rate, I'm gonna go watch Out Cold. Justin said it was awesome, so if I don't laugh my buttocks off then he will be slapped. Later tards.

      Mmmm. I'm currently enjoying a fantastic meal from McDonald's fast food service. It encompasses a Double Cheeseburger, a Hot n' Spicy McChicken, an Apple Pie, and a large cup of Coca Cola Classic. How good it is you will never know. Or maybe you will know, now that I think about it...  Chris stayed the night last night. He brought over my Mad at Gravy. We watched it and I thought it rocked. The parts I had already seen were pretty boring because I watched them so many times by now, but the new stuff was all pretty good, and I liked it overall. Needless to say it was a HUGE improvement over the preview that he sent down a while ago. My lone problem with the tape is how he [Justin] didn't take off the "bull running through the neighborhood" bullshit. That crap is gay as hell. I don't know what he's thinkin. But other than that the movie is good. Chris and I didn't do much else last night. We went to 7-11 and got various types of chips and soda. It was kinda fun. The only thing that sucked is we tried to go down the road and look at the Cavalier that I might be getting, but we couldn't find it. I must've heard my mom wrong or something, I dunno. I get my license tommorrow though! This would be very cool if it werent for the fact that Jesseca can't ride anywhere with me because her mom is a psycho and thinks I will kill her since I don't have any experience. I don't know why she would think that... seriously. There are so many counter arguments to her mom's claim that I won't even list them all, but let it be known that it sucks. Speaking of Jesseca, me and her are going to the mall Sunday to do some much needed school shopping. Her infamous mother has once again foiled my plans, however, and is only going to let us stay there for 2 hours. Because of course she  has  to take us, even though I will have my license by then. Oh man, what a party pooper that woman is. Oh well, i'm not gonna let stuff like that get me down. After all, I will still be getting the Detroit Tigers hat that i've been wanting forever. But if I don't get to spend the rest of the day with my girly girl, I will be mad.  I uhhh, updated my website, if anyone cares to see it. Check out Site Info first (as usual) to see what's new, because you probably won't be able to tell from just looking this time. You can also search for Dave's Hell Palace on Yahoo, Google, and assumedly any other major search engine and you will find that my site has been taken to the top of the searching food chain and it will now get hits from more crazy people than ever. Quite an interesting development if I do say so myself... Chris should be coming over any minute now to get his shit. I dont know if he's staying the night again or what, but I guess it would be fun if he did, because I am pretty bored. But anyway, I'm getting in the shower now so I can cleanse my sexy body. Care to join me? Well, unless your name is Jesseca Wales, I don't give a damn.

       You walk up to her; ask her to dance.  She says "Hey baby, I just might take the chance." You say it's a good thing, that you float in the air. That way there's no way I will crush your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces.   That's from one of the most obscure Weezer songs there is. It's called Only In Dreams and it's Track 10 on the Blue Album. Just a little info on a cool ass song that nobody knows about... I just got home from Louie's house. I stayed there for 5 days because my parents went on vacation and didn't trust me to stay at home by myself (and they shouldn't). My sister moved out the day they left so she wouldn't be here. That left me no other option but to stay at Louie's. We didn't do very much the whole time, and we couldn't leave the house because he's on house arrest. So overall it was very boring and I don't wanna talk about it any further. Me and Jesseca's 9 month anniversary has come and gone, and we're still going strong. I'll be calling her in a few minutes actually, so that's awesome. Mad At Gravy has arrived in Chris's mailbox all the way from Justin's house in Gettysburg, PA. I wanted to pick up my copy earlier today, but Chris was "out and about." Justin tells me to go over there at 10 and get it (that's when Chris get's off of work). I might do that, but I would rather have Chris come here because I don't have Chrome at this time. Either way, i'm hoping MAG will be good, and i'm thinking it will... My new EGM magazine hasn't arrived yet. That sucks. I get my license on Friday. That's sweet. Now all I need is a car to drive. I should be making some minor, as well as major, changes to my website today (you'll see what I mean when I do it)... Whether it gets done or not depends on how long I talk to Jesseca and how bored and tired I am. All right, i'm gonna go call Miss Jesse now.

      Jesseca and I went to the movies last night. I was at Louie's like 30 minutes before the movie started, so I had to get picked up, go home and take a 3 minute shower (the new world record), and speed over to her house and go to Regal (because it's closer and we were running late, but nobody goes there anymore). We were gonna see Pirates of the Carribean, but since we were running late we just snuck into Bad Boys 2. It turned out to be a good decision after all. It was a damn good movie. Tons of action, plenty of laughs, and a budget that was literally off the charts. They were destroying stuff left and right for two and a half hours, the amount of money that went into this movie must have been ungodly. Not that it was a bad thing; demolishing lots of stuff is definitely a plus. Down with the haters, Bad Boys 2 rocks. As for Jesseca, she's just as beautiful as ever, if not more. I had to restrain myself from singing Eric Clapton - You Look Wonderful Tonight on several occasions (seriously). It was also friggin cold in that movie theater and I wanted to hug her the whole time but the damn drink holders kept me from doing so... that's why Oceanwalk is much better. But anyway, that was the second time we've hung out this week, the other one being Sunday. Hopefully we start seeing eachother this much all the time, because i'm lovin every minute of it.  On a slightly different note, my website has been updated. Everyone should go there  now ; the link is on the sidebar. First read the Site Info section for details on what's new. This happens only about once every two months, so I would say it's a fairly momentous occasion. More is coming soon, and i'm not just saying that for the sake of saying it.  I left some crap at Louie's when I left yesterday, so it looks like I'll be forced to go there and get it, and I'll probably end up staying the night... again. It's funny how I stay the night there almost every night, but I never go when anything cool is happening (i.e. the party). I don't really care all that much that i'm "missing out," it's just funny to me... All right, I think I'm done for now. You gotta love the three paragraph entries :)

      I didn't go to Louie's party last night, LoL. I instead opted to go to Jesseca's house and spend the day with her. I was thinking about going over there after I got home, but by that time it was already past 11 and I was tired as a mofo, so needless to say that didn't happen. Sorry Lou, but I wasn't about to ride my bike way the hell out there just to go to sleep. I don't regret not going to the party one bit, because J. Wales and I had tons of fun watching  Zoolander  and  A Guy Thing , and doing other things. I kind of wonder if the party was any good, and who was all there, but oh well; I don't care enough to call anybody and ask.  I tried to watch The Royal Tenenbaums (doesn't deserve italics) just now and it was the most boring trash of all time so I just turned it off and deleted it. I'm still pissed off from how gay that movie was. Even though it is listed as a comedy, it is not funny  whatsoever . I now permanently hate those fagets Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow for being in such a gay movie. Arrrgggghh they make Hulk angry. Ben Stiller kind of sucks too but eh, I don't hate him.   I have 3 movies left that I haven't watched yet, and then again I can just read Harry Potter (or play some video games) when I get bored. I wanna go to Best Buy and get some stuff, so if I ever talk to Chris i'll ask him if he wants to go. I'm leavin.

      I just watched the movie  The Usual Suspects  and all I can say is  Holy Shit , what a great movie! The whole time I knew the ending was something surprising (who doesn't know that?), but even so, I was amazed when I found out what was going on. That has got to be one of my favorite endings of any movie; It's awesome. If you can't tell by the wiggage, that was a good movie. Everyone should watch it, now.  All right. I'm done preaching about my movies. Louie is saying there's a party at his house tonight... depends on who's going, but as long as there isn't too many kooks i'll be there. I won't say I have nothin else to do, because I do (I have like 6 movies downloaded :), I just think I need to have some fun. Hopefully there will be plenty of people to challenge in the videogame department, because that's all i'm interested in really. I love to beat people in shit; Especially Tekken... Oh yeah. The more I think about this party the better it sounds, so Louie better not let me down. And there better be pizza, soda, and ice cream or i'm leavin.  Jesseca is going on vacation today until Monday, but she'll be gone all day Monday because she has to work and then go fishing with her band [of fisherman finks]. That means I won't be able to see or talk to her until Tuesday. This is sad news indeed, my friends. I'm gonna go cry now.

      I have the song  Boys of Summer  in my head to the extreme. That's pretty much all i'm thinking about right now. I could listen to that song all day long, and I do, so it's probably going to be played out soon. Good thing there's three versions: The original by Don Henley, The Ataris style, and the DJ Sammy techno mix. They're all sweet, in case you're wondering.  I'm getting some stuff done today, or at least it seems that way. I got Chrome (the legendary bike) back from Jesseca's house yesterday, along with my hat and the new Harry Potter book. The latter is not mine; i'm just borrowing it from her so I can read it. But anyway, I plan on fixing up Chrome sometime soon. It would be nice to have it done before like 12 so I can ride it to Best Buy before it closes. By fixing it up I mean taking off the brakes, because they barely work anyway; tightening the back tire, because it breaks loose and grinds the frame every once in a while; greasing up everything with WD-40, because that stuff is the miracle solution and it will work wonders on the bike; and taking off the flashlight, because it looks gay and I could care less about cops anymore. After I do all that i'm gonna go to Best Buy and attempt to buy the CKY box set. If they don't have it, and i'm pretty sure they won't, then I have a backup list of things to buy, including: CKY4, Donnie Darko, The Breakfast Club, and Empire Records. I could theoretically get all of those if I don't get the box set, but with price changes and tax, who knows. No matter what, i'll come home with a crapload of cool stuff, so I don't care either way. You wanna know how I can afford all this stuff without having a job? It's easy, a whole bunch of change. I pick up, steal, or save every single penny, nickel, dime, or quarter I come across. Whereas most other people don't pay attention to such things, I know better. I just rolled upwards of 50 dollars in change, so you can't say doing what I do doesn't pay dividends. And it's all cash, so ha.  Concerning the internet, I have been extra bored lately, so I have added Morgan's journal to the host of links over there to the left. I also hope to finish up a bunch of stuff on my website today. But don't count on it, because i'm known to go lazy all the sudden and stop working on it. Just consider yourselves lucky if there is an update to that place.  Have I stated enough that I love Jesseca? Not today. I love Jesseca! I was at her house almost all day yesterday. It was pretty fun, and i'm glad I got to see her, because it rules when that happens... Switching subjects, I get my license on August 1st, so that's awesome. I don't even know if i'm gonna pass the test, but I heard it was easy as pie so i'm not worried about it at all. I don't have a car though, and that is a little worrying. My parents keep telling me I need to get a job and then they will buy me one. So that's cool, now I just need to start looking for one. A car that is. Job schmob I say, school is starting soon, so I won't be able to work very long, and that's gay. Enough about this, because i'm just rambling anyway... Who's Got Game comes on tonight, and tomorrow is Road Rules, and then the Real World. All the coolest shows in the world. Be sure to tune in. Oh and did you see the fight between Abram and Donnel? How about the biggest Real World lie ever? Hahaha they were both funny as hell.  Abe beat that fat nigger's ass  (sorry, but he deserved it) and CT is the man. That's all I have to say, but I will leave you with this little anecdote -  Dave from RR: "What's for lunch?"  Abe: (said immediately in a flat voice) "Cornbread."  Me: Haha!!!!!

       Someday you will find me Come beneath the landslide In a shampagne supernova in the sky   In case you haven't noticed, I dig the idea of starting out my journal with cool little parts of songs in italics...   I can already tell this is going to be an odd day. I tried going to sleep at like 4am but it didn't work so good. Instead, I decided to stay up until tonight and then go to bed in hopes of returning to a normal sleeping schedule, one where I wake up fairly early in the morning and go to sleep around 1am; that would be ideal. Yesterday I finally pushed it to the point where some sort of extreme measure needed to be taken to break my bad sleeping habits. I went to sleep at 6am and slept until 6pm. Not only is that borderline nocturnal, but I slept for 12 freaking hours. That's way too much for me. I could be doing better things than sleeping... that's why I need to stay up until at least 9pm tonight. Succeed, and everything will be set straight; Fail, and I will be caught even deeper in the most obsurd sleeping schedule of all time. Pretty high stakes if you ask me... but I haven't slept in a long time, so I wouldn't ask me.  It has been my observation that being tired is basically like being drunk. A lot of the same symptoms apply to both, like: not being able to think straight, blurred vision, the inability to walk without looking like a nutter, slurred speech, the tendency to laugh at everything (even if it isn't funny), etc. As you can see, I have a point here, but at this time my mind is unable to figure out just what that is. I'm sure you get it though, so that's all that counts.  Due to my current [sad] state, I don't think I'll be able to do anything brain stimulating. I'll be this way all day, so I guess I'll be limited to doing mundane tasks like building toothpick houses and stuff. Hopefully I will get the chance to film the remainder of the CRYK skits today. Then I will be all crazied up and ready to go. I also wanted to go to Jesseca's house to get my bike (and maybe hang out at her house for a couple hours), but I don't think I'll be doing that today because by time she gets home from work I will be drowsy to the extreme and I would be no fun to be around. I will most likely do that tomorrow then. Alright guys, game over.

       She is smiling like heaven's down on earth Sun is shining so bright on her And all her wishes have finally come true And her heart is weeping This happiness is killing her It's true, she's in love  She'll be right here in my arms So in Love She'll be right here in these arms She can't let go   As John would say: That song is like, badass! It's called  HIM - Right Here In My Arms  if you wanna hear it. I think you would like it, no matter who you are. But anyway, my day was pretty lamo today. I'm not complainin' though, because it was pretty fun, I laughed at a bunch of stuff; I just didn't actively do very much. I called Jesseca at like 2 today and she didn't answer the phone... that kind of sucked because I was looking forward to hanging out with her. So I don't know what she did today but I miss her a whole lot for some reason.... Alan, Zac, and Mike came over for a little while today. It was pretty crazy, I didn't expect that one. They are the craziest kids on the block though, so what do ya expect? Alan told me how David Lee, Glen, and Runk (the last two are cardshop dwellers) have all gone gay. Yes, you heard me right, they are fucking homosexuals. This information tottally blew my mind. It seems like everyone is gay nowadays. I hope nobody else turns homo on me or I might flip out. I can see with David Lee because he hangs out with Tebbe all the time, but Glen? and Runk?... wait, actually Runk did seem a little too nice. And Glen did have a high ass voice. Hmmm, it all makes sense now... queers.  Last night Chris and I went out to NSB with Misty and Colleen at like 2 in the morning and stayed at some crazy house they were house-sitting for. I guess they had to stay there to take care of the dogs while the people were away or something, but i'm not too sure really. It was crazy as hell though. We just ate all the people's food and trashed the place pretty much. Actually we didn't trash the place, but we did eat all the food, and that was fun enough. After that we watched  Blow  and took a bunch of crazy pictures of us wigging out. Chris was sleeping and I put a Merle  Haggard  album thingy in his arms and took a picture. Haha, it will be funny when that roll gets developed.   In other news, i'm obsessed with that new show  Who's Got Game?  on MTV. I pretty much waited all day today to see the new episode. It was cool, and as for the show as a whole -- I loooove it (Snoop Dogg style). The new  Real World  is another one of my new favorite shows. The only thing I dislike is how you have to watch this crap all chopped up in 30 minute segments every week throughout like 2 months. I would much rather just wait for the end of the season and watch the marathon all day. Well, that is, of course, if I wasn't such a sucker for all the drama :). Did you hear about the episode that's coming on tomorrow? Or maybe it's tonight, i'm bad with TV times... But anyway, they're hyping it up as "the biggest  Real World  lie ever." When you think about it, there hasn't been too many lies to draw comparisons with, yet I still must watch it to see what happens. I think i'm turning into one of those soap opera freaks who read those little books about the soaps and ... bad example, nevermind.  My mom, my sister, and I were all looking through the old picture box tonight and it was awesome. I remembered almost everything in the photos like it was yesterday; it was weird. I think everyone should look at old pictures every once in a while, because it's funny seeing all this old stuff that you used to have, and especially to see how everyone looked back then. If there is one thing I learned about myself as a child it's that I should've cut my hair way more. I spent about 5 years of my life with either hair down to my chin/ shoulders or with the mushroom cut. I looked crazy. It always looks like I need to get the hair out of my face and it bothers me when I look at it. Besides that though, I was a pretty handsome kid. The best haircut I had was in my early years (3-6) when I had a mullet. If you look at some pictures of me from that time period you will be mesmerized by the perfect mullet. You won't even be able to focus on anything else in the backround because of the power of my mullet. It was that cool. And uh, yeah... that's all I have to say about that.  Have you heard that Justin's computer got fried? Well, according to his cousin Eric he has lost everything he had on it. That means all of his songs, documents, pictures, videos, and of course, pornos are gone. Sucks for him, huh? I sure think so. Chris Montag has also started working at Domino's Pizza in case you didn't know. I thought that was funny. He answers the phones there so you can prank him anytime you want; I know i'm going to. One last thing:  I took down your website Louie . It was costing my dad 5 dollars a month to host it. Looks like you're gonna have to bite the bullet and figure out how to do it with your own computer. It's really not that hard, and all you have to do once you figure it out is republish everything, and that doesn't take very long because I do it all the time. Put it this way -- if Justin can do it, anybody can do it.  For those of you who have been waiting for me to write a lot of stuff, I hope you had fun reading all that, because I had fun writing it. I will probably do another entry fairly soon because I have more to say. I just figured that enough was enough for right now. Very well then, very well. Oh yes, and because I didn't say it enough today --  I Love Jesseca .

      These last two days have been pretty damn gay. This is mostly due to the fact that I have watched nothing but crappy little 2 minute clips of people doing CKY/ Jackass type bullshit. Don't get me wrong, I love CKY, and Jackass is pretty cool too, but out of the 100 or so videos I watched, only about 6 were good. I guess not everyone can be cool like us *sigh*. However, I did watch  Labyrinth  today, and it was definitely a highlight. The classic "Dance Magic Dance" scene never gets old. Neither does the rest of the movie, but that part especially rocks. Which brings me to some recent happenings: the gang of crazy punkers are running wild on Kelly's journal again. Once again I had to silence them with some harsh talk about their lifestyle and such. It may seem cruel now, but it will be good for them in the long run. They need to wake up and smell the coffee -- calling yourself straight edge is G-A-Y. So is being a punky brooster, but if they would just shut up with their "X edge break face break X" crap for a little while, then I would forgive them for that little detail. Ahhh, I guess these kooks never learn... But anyway, I hear that 4th of July is coming up very soon, as in Friday. I don't know about you, but I love the 4th of July. I'm supposed to be going with Jesseca somewhere to see a fireworks show. Those are usually pretty lame, but since i'll be with her it will be like heaven. I still want to light some stuff on fire myself though, so somebody better give me a lighter and a box of fireworks. That would be great. This is my one chance to let out my inner pyro all year, so I might as well take advantage of it. I think my sister is gonna get a box full of cool stuff; hopefully i'll be able to get a hold of some of those. Alright, i've resorted to rambling on and on about nothing now so I will take that as a sign that I need to stop writing. Until next time...  P.S. "If she kisses you i'll make you a prince. (Really?) Prince of the land of stench! Hahaha!" -- That was said by Jareth a.k.a. David Bowie in  Labyrinth . It was funny as hell when he said it. You know what i'm sayin if you're a big fan of  Labyrinth . Peace.

      Oh my god. I am sweating my ass off. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's because I have some sort of radical new disease that makes you sweat all of the fluids out of your body within 24 hours. Perhaps I am nervous about something to the point where I am going into a sweaty fit about it. Here's an idea --  it's fucking hot as hell (literally) in this nigger. Pardon my french, but come on, somebody needs to reinstall the air conditioning system is this room. And that ain't no joke, ya bloke.  That post I made earlier tonight was just some wiggage that I thought up spur of the moment. It said nothing about what is currently going on in my life. Not that i'm obligated to talk about my life on here, but since i'm bored, I figured I would just write some more. To clear it up, I was only half serious about my pro- Blogger speech, so don't send me hate mail about how LiveJournal is better; I don't really care that much. Now onto some things that are a little more important. Last night me, Chris, Alan, Louie, and Steve were out filming skits when we got pulled over by the cops for "pounding on people's doors." I later learned that they had also recieved various calls that there were some kids running around the area naked. Now who could that be? I won't explain that whole situation; you can speculate for yourself what happened there, and find out later when you watch  CRYK  for the first time. Anyway, those dirty pigs ended up stealing our tape straight out of our camera. They said that we could get it back after the "investigators" watched it. I am skeptical about that one. I bet they just wanna see our video. Those bastards used their power to get an early sneak peek at  CRYK . Good thing we backtalked them to the extreme and, in some cases, made them look like fools. Like when Louie said that his grandpa's funeral was on the tape and that they would probably take pleasure in watching it (implying that they were sick kooks). And when they told us we were out past our curfew and we said that it was only because they kept us there for an hour. It was also funny when the black cop was watching the tape and we blatantly say the word "nigger" on it. Luckily they only watched a small portion of the tape in our presence, because that is only the first in a long line of offensive things on it. It still kind of sucks that those fags took our tape. I'm just glad we're getting it back. And to the investigators of the  OBPD , I hope you enjoy it.

      I have been reading this guy's humorous column for approximately four hours now, and after all that readin', I feel like writing. So here I am, doing just that. Lately, Louie has been talking about how awesome LiveJournal is. He preached to me about how easy it is to use, and he even showed me this little downloadable program that you can use to update your journal straight from your desktop within seconds. I'm glad that he's so excited about LiveJournal, but it's not exactly the best invention since the microwave. I happen to like Blogger. It's easy to use and it gets the job done; what more could you want from a friggin online journal? I don't care to express the current mood i'm in, or tell everyone what song i'm currently listening to. (What if i'm not listening to music, did anyone ever think of that?) And best of all, with Blogger, you don't have to waste your time reading 75 incoherent, badly written comments from some assholes who won't even leave their names. What good could possibly come from some random butt faced punker (or anyone else for that matter) giving me their two cents about what I write? I sure can't think of any. And even if you can think of something, you can't tell me about it on my journal. So call me a hypocrite, tell me i'm wrong, tell me I made ten thousand grammar and spelling errors in this post, but do it somewhere else, because I don't care what anyone else has to say about my writing. And that, my friends, is the beauty of  Blogger . Did I mention that the user interface has just recently been rebuilt from the ground up and is now undeniably sexy? Or that everything loads much faster than ever before? Or that there are new features galore and the sky is now the limit since  Blogger  has been bought out by  Google ? Oh yes, it is all true. I urge everyone to quit using that pesky LiveJournal or any other means of having an online journal type thing, and start using  Blogger  today. There is nothing to lose, because it's totally free! All the cool people use it, like me and Jesseca! Yay!  That was quite a rant for a topic about something that I normally wouldn't even pretend to support. I guess that's what eight days of not writing anything more than my little scribbles on post-it notes will do to me. Oh yeah, and  Blogger , i'm expecting my endorsement check in the mail anyday now. (Seriously.)  I'm gonna go try to watch  Harvard Man  now. The last time two times i've tried to watch it I fell asleep a little more than halfway through. That's probably a bad sign, but on the brighter side, I now know why I only paid $5.88 for it.

      Oh yeah, and did I mention that I have sexual frustration and schoolwork out the gizang? Well I do. Despite all of this, I seem to be more happy than I have been these past couple weeks or so. Well, if it weren't for Jesseca's mom ruining everything that is. I think it just hasn't sunk in yet. And there's still hope because I don't know for sure if she is grounded because I haven't talked to her. Don't worry though, the depression will set in soon enough.

      So Jesseca and I were supposed to go to the Mainland game tonight, but at the last minute her mom freaked out and said she couldn't go because she lied to her about having homework. And because she didn't tell her that I was going... so she thought she was trying to "sneak that in" or something. I dunno it's all a big pile of horse shit if you ask me. It pissed me off really bad. Which explains the previous entry; I was talkin about Jesseca's mom. I supressed my anger enough to call her and see if she might still be able to go. Her mom picked up the phone and says some gay shit. She was like "Dave, Jesseca isn't gonna be aloud on the phone for a long time, because she lied to me" I'm thinkin so fuckin what lady, get over it, people lie all the time, she was just tryin to have fun you fuck. But all that came out was "um alright" with a slight attitude in my voice, but not nearly enough given the situation. I should have wigged out on her far more than I did. Damn... well anyway, I ended up going to the game with Chris and Mike. Mike drove us there. He got his license today. I would care much more if my anger didnt loom so heavily, but it's still pretty cool. Mainland also won the game, but they played some chumps so it doesn't matter. We'll see next week when they face the phenominal badasses of downtown (Seabreeze). After the game I got a frosty at Wendy's and I couldn't even enjoy it because of the cut inside my lip. It hurts like a biotch. It's infected for sure. I'm talkin about this stuff, but it doesn't really hold much meaning for me because i'm too busy thinking about Jesseca. I feel sorry for her a lot since her mom is wiggin out on her, but at the same time, I would not take that shit. What's her mom gonna do if she disobeys her anyway? She can't really do anything. I would just say to hell with her and do what I want. But Jesseca refuses to do this, so eh, we're both screwed. It ruins my life hardcore when she gets grounded like this. Plus I already haven't seen her for 2 weeks, and it looks like it will be like a month more if nothing fortunate happens. I can't really do anything about it because I love her so much, so I have to just wait around for a long ass time and hang out with the gang. I don't even drink or do drugs, so I can't drown out my problems that way... I dunno, I have to deal with this shit the old fashioned way I guess. Just deal with it. Listening to hardcore music sure does help though. I'm rambling and revealing the inner workings of my brain to anyone who wishes to see it, so I'll be stopping now... later.

      Oh boy, oh boy do I love my Paradise Hotel. It just keeps getting better and better for me. I only wish I had started watching it from the first episode! That would be the ultimate. But as it is, the show still kicks some major ass. My favorites are Dave and Charla. They rock. If they don't win I'm gonna cry, because i'm the lady at Jesseca's work who cried when Zach left... I'm outtie, ya heard? HOLLAAAAAAAA!

      It turns out that Jesseca went and did some crazy shit all day, so I was left to sit around and do nothing. She called me at like 6, and since then i've been playing Super Ghouls N Ghosts and Ghosts N Goblins; the sequel and prequel, respectively. In case you didn't know, they are two of the hardest games ever made. As far as that goes, I have some good news and some bad news. First, the good news. I finally managed to beat SGNG. It's a good thing I did too, because if I didn't succeed this time I would have smashed the cartridge with a sledgehammer. It wasn't really worth all the trouble I went through, but it was good to have some closure on that damn game. Secondly, I was NOT able to beat Ghosts N Goblins. Well I made it all the way through, but once you do that you have to do it all over again with some crazy weapon. I dunno, after a while I got pissed off and just quit. It wasn't really worth it anyway. It's not easy for me to recount the level of frustration I had while playing the game, but I found this review that says exactly what I wanna say --  "Back in the old days, NES games were hard. Not just hard--old school NES games were like a big mean kid on the playground that made you eat dirt and say you like it. Except Ghosts 'N Goblins doesn't just make you eat dirt, it makes you eat broken glass. Then it rubs your face on the concrete, kicks you in the back of the head, pees on you, and laughs at your pain. "  "How did they test market this game? Maybe they gave it to a roomful of kids and kept upping the difficulty until it made them all cry. I would say this is easily the hardest Nintendo game ever made, and that's saying a lot. Challenge is usually a good thing, but taken to this extreme it's definitely not. "  Props go to that dude for explaining it so perfectly. The entire review can be found  urlLink here . I encourage everyone who's at all interested to read it because it's surprisingly well written and it tells more about that piece of shit game... well that's about all for right now. I'm kind of in bad mood because of the Jesseca situation so I don't feel like writing very much. I will wig out tomorrow. Whether or not that means I will write in this is for you to decide.

      I went and saw My Boss's Daughter last night. It sucked really bad. I don't know if it was because they tried too hard to be funny or if way too much slapstick was implemented, but either way, I didn't like it at all. Louie and I wigged out at my house afterwards with my little sister and her friends. We danced to Planet Vybe for a little while, using my dining room light for a strobe light. That was kinda fun, but the music ended so we stopped. We also ate Taco Bell, and laughed endlessly at "Round one!" said in a crazy voice. Overall I would give the night like a 5 out of 9.  Looking towards the future, I should be buying 3 cheap ass DVDs very soon. Probably 3 Ninjas Kick Back (the third in the series I believe), Rambo III, and Encino Man. The craziest movies ever, but what do you expect for the low-low price of $5.88? The tickets have been ordered for the Dashboard Confessional concert on September 13th as well. We're definitely going this time, unlike last year, so it will kick arse. Umm, I've been writing the script for the Mafia Movie that we'll be making. So far I only have the Characters and the person who plays them, Prologue, and Beginning Credits sequence done, but it will start coming along soon enough because I have everything that happens in the movie in my head; I just need to write it down. While i'm on the subject of Productions, we couldn't get the tape back for CRYK in our last two attempts, but the word is that we'll be getting it for sure on Monday... If you're wondering what the near future holds, I am supposed to be going over Jesseca's pretty soon to hang out with her and her friend Alicia. I've never met her friend before, but it should be cool because they're gonna dye my hair some crazy colors or something. I don't really know what's going on but it should be crazy. I called her an hour ago but no answer. I'm gonna go try again. You are the weakest link, goodbye!

      Everything has been going pretty shitty lately. Well not everything... School has been fine. As far as academics go anyway. I think I have almost 100% A's in all my classes. Except probably Agriculture, because I didn't go there today. Oh well. That class is gay anyway. There is one of those "Good Charlotte punk" whores in there (you know, the type who just decide to be "punk" all the sudden since they're really ugly losers, and Good Charlotte is on MTV all the time), and that kook pisses me off to an extreme. I usually don't pay much attention to those kind of kids, but it's hard to ignore her when she says such stupid ass shit. She's always having these debates with her fellow assholes about which bands are punk and which bands are pop. And get this, she labeled The Ataris under the pop genre. I wanted to strangle her right then and there, but that isn't the end of it. She then went on to say fuckin Rooney and and Good Charlotte are "real punk" and The Ataris can't sing. She said The Ataris can't sing like a million times too. It was like she was trying to rub it in or something. First of all, who the fuck is Rooney? Second, does she not realize that Good Charlotte sounds wayyy more popish than The Ataris do? Oh, and another thing. She called a bunch of bands sell outs and said The Ataris' only good song was Boys of Summer, and it's not even their song; "it's really by the Beatles." At this point I was freaking  infuriated . (For those of you who don't know, The Ataris have been in the underground music scene forever before "making it big," and have plenty of awesome songs that that bitch has apparently never heard. Also, the song  Boys of Summer  is NOT by the Beatles. It's by Don Henley. And finally, Good Charlotte is widely considered to be among the biggest punk music "sell-outs" ever. Not to mention their music is basically pop.) Not that I care about such things... It's just that if someone talks trash about The Ataris, they need to get their facts straight, because that's pretty much slander to me. If I knew this girl's name I would put it on my website along with a banner that would say "20 DOLLARS TO WHOEVER SLAPS THIS CHICK IN THE FACE." I don't usually promote the beating of women, but she deserves it.  Before I went off on that tangent about that dumby in my Agriculture class, I was about to explain the reasons why I'm currently mad at the world. Chiefly, there are 2 things that are causing this --  1)I failed my driving test. 2)I failed my driving test again the next day. If you haven't experienced that crap (failing the test), then you don't know what it's like. It sucks very badly. It's probably the most annoying trash i've ever been through. This is mainly because the test is very easy, and stupid little stuff caused me to fail both times. The first time I pulled into the wrong side of the lane because I thought the course was just like a 1 way thing. The second time I did fine, except for at the beginning when some crazy negro pulled out at the same time as me and honked her horn like a million times. That was gay. She made me seem like an idiot when we were both in the wrong. The only thing is, I was taking my test and she wasn't. Gimme a break lady. Gah. Oh well though. I'll probably be trying that shit again tomorrow. And the next day. And the day after that. If I don't pass it that is. I don't even care really. They'll eventually get tired of seeing me and just hand it over and tell me to leave. If not then i'm prank calling that place every 5 minutes for the next 6 years.  P.S. I'm not really as mad as I might seem about this. In fact, this whole scenario is very funny to me. That's probably the reason I fail the test, because I don't take it very seriously. I guess i'm gonna have to get serious on these fools. I will seriously look behind the car for 700 hours if that's what they want. And after that, 600 more years of me looking side to side to see if any imaginary cars are coming at every stop sign in that little course. We'll see who fails what, ya punks.

      Man i'm frickin tired as Paul Bunyan after a hard day's work right now. That's all that i've been hearin from everyone lately though... "i'm tired, i'm tired, i'm tired." I don't really know what's goin on. That seems to be the new trend. Pretty soon it will be cool to tell people you're tired. So next time you see your friends at a party, make sure to go up to them and say "Hey man, i'm tired as fuck, how about you?" (whatever they say) "hell yeah dude let's take a nap up in this biatch! Woot Woot!" and go to sleep soon thereafter. I'm tellin ya, sleeping is the future, so you better embrace it.  I've been spazzing out lately (falling asleep at random times of the day, and doing other maniacal acts such as completing my homework and dancing to the rhythm of that Conga beat), so I haven't been able to write in this very much... well not at all actually. That kind of sucks for you, because there's been so much going on. I had all of this crap to write about for so long and everyday a few more things got added on and eventually I just forgot everything. So that's that. There is a few things that happened today and yesterday that I would like to touch on shortly. First, Zac and I laughed at John Kinder histerically last night because all he talks about is gettin fat sacks of weed, trading them for a bunch of shrooms, drinkin down on alchoholic beverages, doing other drugs, smoking more weed, poppin pills, eatin shroom caps, fat weed bags, trippin on shrooms, smokin down on bags of weed, weed, weed, drugs, more drugs, etc. Seriously, there is no exaggeration there. That's all he fuckin says and it's hilarious. We blatantly laugh at him to his face and he's just like "come on Zac, let's go pick those shrooms and trade em for that fat ounce of cryp, and take a shot you pussy." And then we laugh some more and he's like "you don't want weed?" (rolling on the floor, crying from histeria) "what's wrong with you guys? you don't like weed? take some shots, smoke some weed, let's get those caps" at this point we are wiggin out to the extreme with laughter and he gets confused and leaves, mumbling shit about weed as he walks away. Oh man... it might not sound funny, but if you were there and you heard him saying this stuff, it would be funnier than anything you've seen in your life... The second thing I wanted to talk about is this dude I knew from Arizona got murdered. They found his body burned up in his car in the desert. They don't really know what happened yet, but it's some pretty crazy stuff either way... Third, I went and saw Uptown Girls with Jesseca at the Oceanwalk Movie Theater tonight. I didn't really care for the movie. I would prefer to have seen Freddy vs Jason instead. But she liked it and she said she woulda got scared seeing Freddy vs Jason, so as long as she enjoyed it that's all that matters. I'll tell ya what though, it's gay going to movies with her and then coming home by myself directly after. It makes me feel lonely. So now i'm gonna go listen to that song that goes "oooonnnne is the loooonnnnliest number that you'll eva seeeeeeeeee." I'm dead serious about this, so i'll catch you later.

      It's funny when people are messing around with babies and they say "Coochie Coochie Coo!" while tickling them. Don't you agree? Haha, I'm just messing around. This won't count as an actual entry because it's too dumb. I do have a lot to say about school, though... I want to describe my cast of teachers and stuff. Unfortunately, I've been busy all day with school and homework and eating and sleeping, so I didn't have time to write anything besides this craziness. Tomorrow I should have much more to recount, as well as the usual stuff about my life... and maybe some interesting details regarding my sex life and the exact size of my penis in inches. Nah i'm just kidding about the last part. In your dreams maybe.  P.S. My sister told me that John (AKA Hardcore John Nealon) called and asked for me early this morning, like right after I left for school. I wonder what he's up to? He probably needs a place to hide out for a while... lay low if you know what I mean. If that's the case then he should go visit Justin in Pennsylvania, because around here,  it's slim pickins boy !

      The topic has really been beaten to death lately, but school started today, and I was there to witness it. I don't really care about the academics involved. It's pretty much the same as the last 2 years... Mostly I was amazed by how crazy looking all these kids were. There are the old favorites such as The Uptight Raptor, Baby Face, and the Pat Wannabe, among others. And then there are the new (and ever so hilarious) recruits like The Small Headed Rasta Nigger, a large gang of retards, and many other mayhem causing midgets. The one that stands out the most, however, is actually from the old school (OBMS), and has returned from his hiatus crazier than ever. The man I am talking about is none other than the infamous "Tha Kook." He is the king of all that is funny looking. The queen of corruption. The duke of dingus eggs... alright maybe I'm taking this too far, but to me and Chris he is the craziest motherfucker to walk the halls of Seabreeze since Sebastian Janikowsi. He cracks me up. We used to hold signs up to him in middle school that said "Tha Kook" in big letters with an arrow pointing towards him. It was funny because he used to get all mad at us for it and he got serious a couple times, including an incident where he shot me in the eye with a rubber band and I slapped him. Oh yeah, and in case anybody is keeping tabs on this queer, he now has long hair and a beard, and hangs out with the "rocker" crowd. The meaning of his life is to provide me with another reason to laugh every day at school, and one of these days he's probably going to notice and there is gonna be a rumble between our group of gangtas versus his band of cock rocking homos. I can't wait until that day. Look forward to my overly exaggerated story of that in the future... On a closing note, Nick Tremper is back, and he looks more like a gay fucker than he ever has. He looks so gay, in fact, that he has earned the nickname "Gay Tremp" by me and my comrads. That's all for this edition of "The Humorous Looking Assholes At Seabreeze" report. This is Davey Dank signing off.  I would really have liked to talk to Jesseca today and ask her how her day at school went, but i'm guessing that's not gonna happen. She said she had to go to Kidsko and get some crap today... Oh well though, I'm freakin tired as hell anyway. I need all the sleep I can get so I'm leavin now I guess.  P.S. Davey Dank?????? Who broke into my Blog and wrote that gay ass name?

      I'm one of those kids who put AIM conversations on their journals in order to make themselves look cool. This one is me and some chick [who I dont know] talking like I'm her friend or something -  SuperStar33089: who is this? Garaputo316: slade SuperStar33089: woops SuperStar33089: hey sorry this is robin jackson SuperStar33089: do you remember me?? Garaputo316: oh yeah Garaputo316: hey girl SuperStar33089: hey SuperStar33089: what have you been up to? SuperStar33089: i havent seen you in a long time Garaputo316: nothin Garaputo316: i know Garaputo316: what have you been doin SuperStar33089: nothing really wakeboarding running and getting ready for school SuperStar33089: nothing too special Garaputo316: oh cool Garaputo316: school's startin soon SuperStar33089: yes it is Garaputo316: summer went by so fast SuperStar33089: i know it did SuperStar33089: but i am ready for school; however, i wont be after a couple of weeks has passed hah SuperStar33089: well i have got to go but i hope to see you soon! goodnight Garaputo316: goodnight Garaputo316: heh  That wasn't cool, was it? I didn't think so. Now let that be a lesson to ya, and next time you are about to put some gay ass conversation on your journal you better think twice about it.  All right, now that I've gotten that out of the way, I must announce that I am back with a vengeance after many days of not writing in this beast. Here's a little summary of what's been going on in my life since the last time I wrote: Later in that day I got really sick, went insane (literally), and tried all kinds of odd things to calm myself down. Some of my actions included: running around, lifting weights, doing sit-ups, and... going Julian's with Mike and Chris to smoke some weed (because even though I don't smoke, I thought doing so would alleviate my insanity). When we got there everyone was looking at me weird and I felt extremely crazy so I freaked out and had my dad pick me up, which was funny because it was like 2 in the morning. I didn't smoke either, if I must point that out. When I got home I was kookin out and breathing hard and shaking and shit so I had to sleep in my mom's bed that night. That's how crazy I felt hehe. I later found out that I had the flu and I wigged out so much because it's a respiratory disease and it makes you get hot and breathe hard, so if you do physical activity it makes you wig out even more. That explains why the degree to which I wigged was so hardcore... if you even know what i'm talking about anymore. Moving on, I felt pretty sick for a few days after that one (Monday), but nothing else really crazy happened. But I did have dry heaves and pee a lot, if that counts... Soon after I got done being sick (well actually before), I went to the mall with Chris, Steve, and Louie and bought some cool gear, and had a ball while doing it. We went there two days in a row, Wednesday and Thursday. It was fun both days because we were wiggin out, yelling shit at people, knocking stuff over, and generally being the obnoxious teenagers that we are. The only thing that bothered me about the mall was that we bought some clothes in Hot Topic. That means we had to stay in there for an extended period of time and talk to the kooks that work there and stuff -- Something that is not too high on my list of priorities. Maybe I'm a jerk for saying this, but shopping at Hot Topic makes me feel like some sort of wacked out gothic corkboarding a-hole. I don't know what i'm talking about exactly but it isn't cool. Especially since I had to carry around a little Hot Topic bag the whole time I was at the mall. It's embarassing you know. I did get some cool ass shirts out of the deal though. The likes of which include The Konami Code, The Strokes, and Finch themed tees. I am wearing the Finch one right now and I like it a lot. (Even though I only know a couple songs from the band. That's what happens when they are all out of the cool ones like Ataris, Taking Back Sunday and Starting Line. Maybe some day.) After the mall on Thursday, we dropped Steve off at his house and went back to Chris's to wig out. On a side note, I hung out at my sister's apartment on Wednesday. It was the first time I'd seen the place and I must admit that it's pretty cool. Her and Dan live there and I love it... Back to Thursday, late night at Chris's. The bulldog came over and Louie punched her. Then Louie and I went to pick up Alexia Meadows and bring her to Chris's. When we got back the bulldog had left and Chris was taking shots of liquor and listening to "I Drink Alone." Later on Louie took Alexia home and never came back, he just went home instead. So Chris and I ended up taking 7 and 6 shots, respectively, and getting fucked up beyond belief. We tried watching Ninja Turtles 2 but ended up just going outside and chasing ducks around and bullshit like that. It was all good and fun until I realized what was going on. Then I started feeling really gross and sick to my stomach. At some time during this period I had serious thoughts of peeing on Chris's carpet because I didn't want to get up. I fell asleep somehow, despite not being tired. I woke up on Friday, which is actually just really early today, with a hangover from hell. I felt like I had to puke really bad but when I tried it didn't work. So I ended up just laying on the futon watching the minutes slowly go by, thinking about how much drinking fucking sucks and wishing I wasn't feeling like crap. I went on like this for many hours until Chris woke up and played some Dashboard Confessional, and that made me feel loads better for some reason and put me to sleep. When I woke up at 4, I had to go home because Chris had to go to work. When I got home I had some milk and that made me feel bad again and I realized the hangover wasn't done with me yet. I toughed it out for a while until Louie called me and told me there was some crazy party in NSB tonight. I was hesitant to go since I felt so bad, but I figured what the heck. I took a shower and chilled for a while. I had to wait until like 6:30 to leave because I refused to go unless I knew I couldn't do anything with Jesseca, and that's when she gets off work. Speaking of Jesseca, I hadn't talked to her since we went to the mall on Sunday and I was beginning to get worried. I still am kind of because I don't know what's going on with her. When I called her today she said she had to go to a sleepover at Kidsko. That sucks that on her last Friday before school starts she's spending her time at work instead of with me where she should be. Then when I got home tonight my dad told me she called me, and that made me sad that I missed the call :( So that's how it's goin with the wifey. Not very good I suppose. But hopefully I'll be able to see her tomorrow, or Sunday maybe. Here's hoping... But anyway, since Jesseca was busy, I was forced to go with Louie to New Symrna tonight. And don't worry, it was crazy as hell. The party died in the planning stages so we just ended up going to Morgan's and watching the movie  They . It was a very stupid movie though and it bored everyone to death. My tale isn't over yet, however. Before we watched They, we had to wait for Chase to get done watching The Jungle Book 2, so we were chillin in Morgan's room right. Then out of nowhere Louie tried to let a turd poke out of his butt in front of me while I was playing a game and accidentally shit all over her room. It was the craziest thing ever done, bar none. She was freaking out because there was crap all over the ground and she told her mom on him and he couldn't stop laughing long enough to explain himself (plus, how do you explain something like that?). Well somehow he managed to blame it on me and I just laughed even more at that because it obviously wasn't. Haha oh man. If only you knew the half of how crazy that incident was.   Whew, I apologize for that paragraph being the longest, most rambling thing ever written, but I was in a hurry to get all of this crap out of my head, because it's been in there for almost a week now. A few more things are on my mind that I must share real fast.  1) Amber, when you read this, don't go off and tell mom that I drink and smoke and stuff now because I don't; That was just a one time thing and you better believe I won't be doing that again for a long time to come. 2) I love Jesseca more than anything in the world and I hope she knows that. 3) It's 4 AM and counting 4) I'm going to bed now 5) That story about Louie shitting on Morgan's floor, it is completely false. 6) As fictional as it may be, it is still funny as all get out.

      Motherfucker. Jesseca's mom is the fucking anti-Christ. She ruins my whole day (and week, pretty much), because she's in her pajamas. This is a situation where most people would simply  put some fucking clothes on . And if I can't go over there, then why the fuck can't Jesseca stay at my house for a little while? Oh yeah, because her mother is an obssessive psycho freak, my bad. Well, if you ask me, that is a complete and total crock of shit. That pretty much sums it up. Now I just need to go buy a punching bag, so I can beat the shit [takke mushrooms] out of it.

      I spent my night reading, reading some more, and watching the New Tom Green Show. And let me tell ya, that Tom Green cracks me up. It seemed like he was extra funny today because it was monster spectacular Friday (or whatever you call it), but then when I think about it, he was just as laugh-enducing last night. You slay me Tom, you slay me.   It might not sound like my night was very eventful, and it wasn't, but a few interesting things did happen. For instance, at 11 P.M. Eastern I tuned into 105.9 O Rock FM and tried to listen to Loveline; but guess what, it didn't come on! This could mean one of three things: It has been canceled, taken off O Rock, or it simply didn't come on tonight. Hopefully it was the latter, because I love that show. To find out for sure i'll keep trying to listen all next week... Going off on a whole nother tangent, i'm looking forward to Dashboard Confessional's new album in the worst way. I have heard two new songs off of it (well one is actually a remix of sorts), and they are both stuck in my head and won't get out.  A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar  is the title, it comes out on August 12th, and you can expect it to be the shiznit. Ya dig? Oh fa sho. Haha, now that I'm already wiggin, I suppose I'll touch on another subject entirely -- Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over. For starters, the title of the movie is funny as hell. Game Over? What were they thinking? At least it's funny, though. My sister saw this movie tonight and she informed me that not only is it awesome, but the whole thing is in 3-D as well. Like they give you the glasses when you buy your ticket. For some reason that is stunning to me. I mean, I didn't know that... Wouldn't it cost like a cajillion dollars to distribute all those frickin glasses? I'm thinkin it would, but what do I know? Now that I think about it, those things are just paper, and they probably wouldn't cost much to produce... Hmmm, in any case, i'm putting  way  too much brainpower into a movie with the subtitle "Game Over."  Back to the real world now [not the TV show, my life], I didn't get my license today. Funny? Yes. But it will give me time to shop for a car. Ahh, who am I kiddin, I still won't have a car on Tuesday (that's the next day the DMV will be open, and coincidentally the same day that I will be obtaining my driver's license). In other news, I recieved an unexpected phone call from Jesseca earlier this evening, and it blew my [frigging] mind. I totally was not expecting her to call. We didn't talk for very long, but it was still cool nonetheless. It's always cool when she does stuff like that, because I love the surprises... All in all, it was not the best Friday night in history, but not the worst one either.

       Wake up, wake up, get up, it's the first of the month...   There was a Bone Thugs N' Harmony song that went something like that a few years back... So, i've had this journal for 12 months now, not exactly a year yet, but the archives show 12 months of stuff that you can read. I went back and read some of the old stuff yesterday and it's all funny to me because I remember everything like it just happened. That's what happens I guess. I got my new EGM today. There were 3 covers that I could've gotten and I got the one I wanted. That's sweet. I always seem to get lucky with this type of thing. My uncle Geno will be over to pay me back for the 20 dollars I let him borrow on Wednesday. What a good guy. Everyone has always told me that he always pays people back, no matter what, but now he's proven that to me. While i'm on the subject of payback, someone has stolen my Bad Karma. I came home from Louie's house on Wednesday and it was gone. I'm guessing it was my sister watching it or maybe bringing it to her friends so they can watch it. If that's the case then i'm fine with that, but they need to tell me they're taking it next time. If it's somebody else, when I find out who it is i'm gonna slap them silly for all the trauma they've caused me.  Oh yeah, and then there's always the fact that  I get my license today . That is pretty crazy to me because 1) I don't feel like i'm 16 and 2) I don't feel like I should be able to legally drive around by myself. But I am, and I can, starting today. You may say, "You can't get your license if you don't pass the test," but i'm not sweating the test very much. Everyone has told me it's easy, and Louie told me exactly what you do and gave me some pointers and stuff, so it shouldn't be a problem. If I do fail it, however, it will be funny as 4 cheeseburgers being huffed into the trunk of an elephant at the same time.

I just wanted to be a dork and try to hack into the Matrix. It didn't work. So yeah... that's your 1 year anniversary special entry... it's gay as hell. Just how you like it, fags.

      Alright my fellow dinoflagellates. I have prepared a speech for this moment, and here it is...  I have been writing in this journal for almost a year now. In fact, the day I started was September 24th, 2002. That's exactly 2 weeks from today, so hopefully that gives you an idea of how long this thing has been going on for. I must say there have been plenty of jokes, song lyrics, tired ramblings, angry rants, heartfelt confessions, and other shit of the sort that I can't think of right now because I only have 60 seconds to write this entire entry or else Arnold Schwarzenegger aka "The Terminator" is going to take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and the girls are pretty, if you know what I mean (basically he's gonna kill my ass). Anyways, that was probably the longest sentence that's ever graced the "pages" of this thing that I call Jareth's Little Ball That He Throws Crazily (for no good reason, I might add). Enough lollygagging though. What I'm trying to say is, I'm done with this and journal and it's time to move on... to LiveJournal :) Before I go, I just want to say that it has been fun the whole time. Well, maybe not the whole time, but overall, it was pretty enjoyable.  Even though I  am  leaving, if you happen to be a big fan of this thing for some reason, don't be distraught, because I'm not abandoning it completely. You can still expect some updates about once a month or so. Maybe more, depending on what's going on. For example, you can bet that I won't forget to say something on the one year anniversary of this beast (which also happens to be the 11 month anniversary of me and Jesseca's wonderful relationship). That means if I have anything to do with it, this place will stay put pretty much forever, or at least until Blogger goes bankrupt, just so people can get on and read all the old stuff I wrote. And there's quite a lot of it, so enjoy. One last thing. You can always expect the links on the sidebar to be updated as soon as someone cool gets a journal, as usual. So you can always come here for the updated list o links in case you forget the name of somebody's journal or something. Well, that's about all I have to say. So farewell my friends, and start reading my new journal, because that's where all the action's gonna be at from now on.  If you're a lazy asshole and didn't feel like reading all that, you can just skip the formalities and goodbyes and click right here --> (  urlLink Dave's New Journal  )to be taken to my new and improved temple of doom.  P.S. On the very day that I leave, Blogger updates their service with like 6 or 7 new features that everyone can use, including free users like myself. You'd think that I would be feeling sorry that I left so soon, but quite the contrary. While I still respect Blogger, I can't help but notice that out of all the new features, there isn't very much that interests me. The bottom line -- No comments? No pictures? Pshh,  I'm leavin .

      Check out this crazy story. It will blow your mind.   Suicide? Or Murder? Or Suicide?  At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his audience with the legal complications of a bizarre death. Here is the story: On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide. He left a note to that effect indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned. Ordinarily, Dr. Mills continued, "a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended" is still defined as committing suicide. Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below at street level, but his suicide attempt probably would not have been successful because of the safety net. This caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands. The room on the ninth floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus. When one intends to kill subject A, but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was his long standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident, that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded. The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus. Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son was in fact Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over both the loss of his financial support and the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth-story window. The son had actually murdered himself, so the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.   Pretty weird, huh? Maybe not to you, but I liked it.

        cuddle and a kiss on the forehead - you like to be close to your special someone and feel warm, comfortable, and needed    urlLink   What Sign of Affection Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Alright, I know I've never done this kind of thing before (putting one of these quizzes on my journal). Mainly because I don't really want to share this crap with other people, and I know they don't really want to read stuff like that. I also never even take the dern things, but that's besides the point. This time was different though. I actually take one of them for once and it surprised me. Not because it was so awesome or anything, but because Jesseca and I got the same result. That definitely means we were meant for eachother. Yup, I'm convinced. This just further proves that we are the biggest twins ever made... Well either that, or the damn quiz is rigged and everybody gets the same thing... But I'm gonna go with the Jesseca and I were built for eachother option, because you and I both know we definitely were. So it's a sealed deal, Camille.

      Heh, well Seabreeze lost motherfuckers. 50-20. I don't care too much about that though, because in this situation I am comforted by the words of a band named Motorhead. In a song entitled Ace of Spades they have this to say: "YA WIN SOME, LOSE SOME, IT'S ALL THE SAME TO ME!" Good motto to have. And right now I will take it as my own...  But onto the subject of a far more important matter, Jesseca. We went to the game tonight and on the way there it was all good... but then like halfway through and on the way home she was just being silent and not really responding to me in the least. She's never done that before ever and it scared the bejeesus out of me. I think she like hates me now or something. I almost had a nervous breakdown on the way home because of it, but then she kind of started talking a little so I don't know what's going on now. She said nothing was wrong, but all I can think about is if there was something wrong she just wouldn't tell me ... There are some pretty disturbing thoughts going through my head, but I don't think I should get all bent out of shape about it if I don't know for sure what she was thinking. But if she does break up with me or something, then i'll really be fucked. Badly bruised and broken... like a head on collision.  So here's hoping it was nothin.

      Well, it's 3:12 am on a school night and I'm still awake. This is certainly not cool, not by any means. But on the plus side, I did get my Agriculture Project done. I also managed to download Haggard, finally. So I will be watching that as soon as I can. Which will probably be Saturday, since I'll be sleeping all day and night Thursday (tommorrow) and going to the football game and otherwise wigging all day on Friday. As far as tiredness goes, I am usually more awake when I sleep for 2-3 hours and then go to school, than when I sleep for 5-6 hours and go to school. I don't know for sure why that is, but I suspect it's because when you sleep for such a short period of time, it's like you haven't even slept at all, and you're not as tired. I dunno, even if I am tired as fuck tommorrow, I'll live through it, so it's ok. Plus I plan on eating a large breakfast including waffles, syrup, and milk galore. So that should help. But for now, I'm off to pass out on my bed and awaken 2 minutes later. Or at least it will seem that way...

      There's always something to remember when deciding whether or not to procrastinate on a school assignment, and it goes as follows --  Hard work pays dividends in the long run, but laziness pays off right now.   That's your lesson for today, folks. And now you can all take my words seriously and fail every one of your classes. Hahaha. I, on the other hand, am too tired in class to commit anything to memory, so I don't even know if I have any homework to do. But if I do, then i'm pretty much screwed.  Now for a quick round-up of some stuff... Paradise Hotel rocks my socks, and yet it pisses me off at the same time. I should have my license and a car by now, but I don't. I should be getting my car soon, but i'm not really in a hurry since it's not very cool. My license I need to get, but I don't feel like waiting in line for 2 hours to take the test again. I'll have to bite the bullet soon enough though. Agriculture, as a class, is assigning too much stuff for its own good. Two projects one day after another? That's BS. The Mainland vs Seabreeze game is Friday, as well as a pep rally before and a party afterwards. It should all be awesome. Jesseca now desperately wants a LiveJournal for some reason. What a traitor! No just kidding, I don't care all that much since I properly defended Blogger in the past. Everyone knows it's better. But if she gets a LiveJournal, then I'm gonna have to convert to it as well, because i'm whipped beyond all belief. And because comments from people are funny. I already have a LJ, but I don't write anything serious in it, so I'll simply have to start getting serious when she makes the switch. Last but not least, the Dashboard Confessional concoit is approaching fast (Next Saturday, or September the 13th), and I'm very excited about it, but at the same time i'm worried because Chris and I haven't recieved the tickets yet. All I know is if we don't get the tickets there's gonna be hell to pay. Actually nothing will probably happen except I'll be like "that's really gay." But still, that's reason enough to hand over the freakin tickets, ya ticket holdin bastards! I am going to sleep now I guess... goodnight.

       Wake up, wake up, wake up, it's the first of the month. Get up, get up, get up, it's the first of the month.   ^ That song is pretty cool. And i've been meaning to use it for the longest time. Finally I have done it... success! Yeah. Well, uh, i've been reading a bunch lately. And doing lots of other stuff that has been pretty fulfilling, but also pretty boring (like reading). There's not much to talk about that anyone else would be interested in except for some crazy adventure Chris and I had last night. But I don't really want to talk about that right now. Let's just say Dimitry Semenenko (or however you spell that kid's name) and his gang of retards wants to beat up Chris now or something... I don't even know what's going on with that situation, which makes it all the more hilarious.  If this were a livejournal, and you were asking my mood, it would be "happy as a fly on poo." As for my current music, that would be "Fuck The World" by ICP. Not because I hate the world or anything; I just find the song very catchy and funny. Ok, you caught me. I hate everyone and everything... To hell with all of you!!!  ***SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT: The statement I made about hating everyone and everything is entirely not true. And even if it were, the exceptions to my hate would include Jesseca Wales, and of course, the taste of cheese***

       I've been sleeping with the lights on, so if I wake, in the night, your picture is clearly in sight.

It's insane. Carazy Quinn is next to me and we're all just playing games and the John aka Hussein kid is wigging out about some Dragonball Z movie that's coming out. I have news for him, Dragonball Z is gay!  Hahaha, he's probably gonna read this, so I'm leavin. Chongyyyy!

      "I'm so glad I'm getting my bake on." - The almighty Chaz  I'll tell ya one thing, driving around beachside yelling crazy shit at random people walking down the road never gets old. Just now I was goin down A1A, screaming "Nigger!" at white people. It's funny calling a white person a nigger because they don't know how to react. They're thinking "What? I'm not black..." and I can see a confused look on their face as I look at them through my rearview mirror. It's funny as shit.  Oh yeah, and the obligatory April Fools joke is this --  Me: Hey John, I found out your mom is a lesbian last night. Her girlfriend told me. John: No way man... what the fuck? Me: Yeah dude, your mom's a bulldike. John: That's so gay. Me: I know... literally. Hahahaha I crack myself up. John: But you're serious about this? Me: NOPE! APRIL FOOLS MOTHERFUCKER!!!

      Mohandas Gandhi walked barefoot most of the time, which produced an impressive set of calluses on his feet. He ate very little, which made him rather frail. And with his odd diet, he also suffered from bad breath. This made him a super-callused fragile mystic vexed by halitosis.
