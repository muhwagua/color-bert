      THANK YOU TO MY "MONDAY CREW" BUDDIES (Alice, Ifang, Allen, Mateo, and Munch) FOR THE ALBUM AND LETTERS.  You all touched my heart so much (Allen, dude, your letter nearly made me choke up and start crying again. :) )  You all are soooo special to me, and we BETTER keep in touch.  I am already contracted to sing for Allen's and Ifang's weddings...anyone else???? I would looooove to, and I wanna know all about your lives in the meantime. :)   Sunday was one of the most memorable days of my life.  I can't remember having felt so loved by friends before.  It was awesome to sing a special praise song for EM service with you guys (and of course Munch, who was actually ushering for offering).  Send me a copy of the tape! I want it for a keepsake (Oh Ifang, the song we sang was "He's Always Been Faithful' by Sara Groves, not "Sarah Owens"!).  But even more memorable was worshipping our hearts out, squished in the same pew, bumping elbows as we clapped and danced and sang.  Dangit, I had been so proud of myself that I had not yet broken down weeping this past weekend, but when the worship team led us into "Your Beloved", I couldn't keep from crying.   There were two things that pushed me over the teary edge. First of all, the central message of that song to me are in the lines "Lord who am I compared to you glory? O Lord, Lord, who am I compared to your majesty?" The rhetorical answer to those questions is "I am nothing, absolutely nothing", and yet we can sing, " I am Your Beloved, Your Creation, and You love me as I am."  At that moment, sitting with you guys worshipping, realizing that it would be one of the last times in a long time that we would be doing that altogether, God's ineffable grace hit home to me.  What the heck did I do to deserve so much love from God and from people? What did I do to deserve salvation and sanctification??? NOTHING.  If anything, I am a gross offense to God. And what's more amazing is that, because I can not do anything of my own strength to be how I should be before God, He loves me the way that I am.  I am still trying to comprehend that! He loves me as I am.  But I see that in my friends' love for me. They love me as I am.  They do not try to change me, but encourage Christ in me to shine more fully, because He is my essence.    Secondly, the song made me cry thinking about Korea.  I sang that song almost everday while I was out there the summer of 1998, by myself at the piano, in Handong's little chapel.  So at the same time that the song made me relish the fellowship of my friends right next to me, it helped me look back at the past and ahead to the future too, seeing a small glimpse of the broad horizon of God's plan.  It's comforting knowing that He is bigger than my plans, my mistakes, my failures....and that He is bigger than my victories too. The past five years have been full of all of these, and yet God remains true to Himself, and therefore to me, because I AM HIS OWN. unbelievable.  I would not have guessed that He would take me back to Handong, but here I go!  And I go a very different person, more seasoned, more aware of my sinful nature, and therefore more astounded by His grace. Korea is going to be another stepping stone for me, I can sense it.  I'm going to learn more of what He's created me for. Me, Sandy Chi, created in the image of God, but uniquely so, and uniqely loved, reflecting His infinite-dimensionality.  Me, Sandy Chi, created in Christ Jesus to do His good works, which He planned beforehand that I might walk in them.    Thank you to everyone who gathered around and prayed for me after the service!  Darren, Allen, and Ifang, thanks for your tears and your spoken representative prayers...I won't forget them.  Jan, thanks for our wonderful tete-a-tete at Tani's and 88 Rice Bowl.  I am glad that I got to spend my last couple of hours in SF with you.  I want you to know that I thank God that He gave us the chance to renew our friendship, to heal the past, and to seal our sisterhood.  You are one-of-a-kind, and I am going to miss you sooo much. You came back into my life and out again like a whirlwind, but I guess 4 months is all we really needed to start over with a stronger foundation of mutual trust, respect, and love in Christ.  WMH, WMDR, WWW! Kick butt in NY, and I will be praying for you.  When I come to visit, let's play hardy! You're ultra ultra special, so don't EVER settle ( you know what I am talkin about :))!!!!!!!  Ask Keith, I overwhelmed him with all the adjectives I used to describe your specialness.:)  My drive down was wonderful.  Didn't leave until 4, and didn't get home until 10:30 (took a nap in the middle), but the drive was so awesome.  I had plenty of time to pray and think. Pray for people I love. Sing and sing. Car-dance (ie, busting the groove behind the wheel. hehe) :).  It was a good way to have my own private, drawn-out goodbye.  The moon was beautiful last night-- round, full, anchored in the sky, and resplendent.  It looked exactly the way I felt.

      the theme song of my year.....  ELIJAH, by Rich Mullins  The Jordan is waiting for me to cross through  My heart is aging I can tell  So Lord, I'm begging for one last favor from You  Here's my heart take it where You will   This life has shown me how we're mended and how we're torn  How it's okay to be lonely as long as you're free  Sometimes my ground was stoney  And sometimes covered up with thorns  And only You could make it what it had to be  And now that it's done  Well if they dressed me like a pauper  Or if they dined me like a prince  If they lay me with my fathers  Or if my ashes scatter on the wind  I don't care   But when I leave I want to go out like Elijah  With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire  And when I look back on the stars  It'll be like a candlelight in Central Park  And it won't break my heart to say goodbye   There's people been friendly, but they'd never be your friends  Sometimes this has bent me to the ground  Now that this is all ending  I want to hear some music once again  'Cause it's the finest thing that I have ever found   But the Jordan is waiting  Though I ain't never seen the other side  Still they say you can't take in the things you have here  So on the road to salvation  I stick out my thumb and He gives me a ride  And His music is already falling on my ears   There's people been talking  They say they're worried about my soul  Well, I'm here to tell you I'll keep rocking  'Til I'm sure it's my time to roll  And when I do   When I leave I want to go out like Elijah  With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire  And when I look back on the stars  It'll be like a candlelight in Central Park  And it won't break my heart to say goodbye   'Cause when I leave I want to go out like Elijah  With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire  And when I look back on the stars  It'll be like a candlelight in Central Park  And it won't break my heart to say goodbye   ------------------------------------------------------  *sigh*  my last evening in SF...  one more service tomorrow at KCPC!    Today, all of college flashed before my eyes....went to Danny and Jieun's wedding, and saw almost everyone I ever knew at Stanford it seems.  Then I rushed from there to the KCPC Youth Group banquet, where four years in the yg ministry were remembered, celebrated, cherished, and sealed in my heart.  A tiring day, but so meaningful.  The Body of Christ as I knew it for the past five years.  I couldn't have asked for a better way to end my stay in the Bay Area.    I am sleepy now, but I am ready to go to bed with a deep feeling of peace.  "You have put gladness in my heart, More than in the season that their grain and wine increased.  I will both lie down in peace, and sleep;  For You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety" Ps 4:7-8

      So I decided to create a blog account.  Actually, I created it months ago, but never got around to writing in it because I really didn't understand it.  I mean, why do people blog, or online journal? I am assuming you write with an audience in mind, right? Is it to keep yourself accountable to writing and thinking and reflecting on your life, or are you just having a one-way conversation with a vague group of people? I've been reading some blogs and I realize that friends will read each other's and respond to each other in their blogs. That's a funny phenomenon, don't you think?=)  It is like a very very delayed conversation.  Why do we do it? I'm just wondering.    But you know, my fascination with it makes me want to try it.  Right now, as I write, I definitely have an audience in mind.  Ironically, I have not given my blog ID to anyone, so I won't even really have an "audience" for awhile.  So in reality I am just writing to myself, just like a real journal, and yet I am not, because the intention (and even motivation) is different.  When I look at my heart, there are two things going on: 1) I have always had a hard time journalling consistently, and I know that a blog will help keep me accountable to that, but it hurts my pride that I need a sort of audience to do it...you know what I mean? I wish that I could do it of my own accord, in private, like my friend Jan, who writes in her journal all the time. 2) I know that I need to overcome the pride, and I also want to be writing more, so I am going to do it.  hehe, that's sort of circular and funny logic, but it's convincing me enough to start writing to this site.  So, what do I see this blog site becoming? A place to think, to reflect, to pray, to encourage others, and to create.  I write poetry, which I've NEVER shown anyone, but I hope to someday soon overcome that barrier of self-consciousness to be able to divulge more of myself to my world. For the most part, I am a very open and transparent person, but for some reason, I haven't been able to share my poetry.  That touches too deep, too close, I guess. But it'll be good for me.  Don't expect it too soon, though, it might take me awhile.  Anyway, some thoughts on where I am right now.  I am leaving the Bay Area soon, on Sunday actually, and I am feeling incredibly heavy at heart to leave the people and places that I have grown to love in my last five years here.  A part of me is afraid that I won't ever see some of them again, but I know that that is silly.  People keep telling me that the world is a smaller place than I think.  I want to believe that....I want to believe that I will see everyone I've ever loved again.    But at the same time that I feel this sadness, I am cherishing my friendships even more with each passing day as my departure draws near.  In that sense, it is a bittersweet time, because it is sweet to know that you are loved, that you will be missed, and that you love, and that you will miss those special to you.  God's love is amazing, and to see it reflected in human relationships is an amazing thing too.  If this is how it is on earth, I can see how the Scriptures would say "I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness....Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere..." The sweetness of love between friends, magnified to the eternal-heavenly scale, except that the  friend is GOD Himself...it's just so incredible that my mind can hardly wrap itself around the concept.  It's funny, phases in life are always beginning or ending, and I have found that the moments of big goodbyes always make me long for heaven.  Not only to meet my brothers and sisters there, but even moreso, to embrace once and for all the Love of my Holy God for me, to become like Him in seeing Him as He is, to finally experience a love that does not end in its incomparably sublime culmination.  This deep longing for heaven was true when I left Korea that great summer of 1998, when I graduated college last year, when I broke up with a long-term boyfriend, and now, as I leave _this_ place, KCPC youth group, friends in the Bay Area as well as SoCal, and my family to go to Korea for a year and then who knows where from there.  Heaven is on my mind, and in my heart, because I realize that the Lord is the only constant in my life and forever. It is not so sad as it is beautiful though.  That I realize. I am blessed by people, the beauty of life, and the love of God, all of which I do not deserve.  I can only praise God when I look back on these past five years. If anyone could have the kind of life experiences and friendships that I've had here in the Bay Area, I'd say they were supremely blessed. I am supremely blessed! Oddly, the fact that this phase of my life is ending makes it even more beautiful.....as Rich Mullins put it so succintly in His song "Elijah": " And when I look back on the stars, it'll be like a candlelight in Central Park..."  That line emphasizes the beauty of the contrast of light and darkness, and in this case, sadness and joy, friendships and goodbyes, closeness and farness--  the effect of the whole which is beautiful.  Now, where to? Korea! What to expect? The goodness of God to be sure.....that's one thing I know that I can hold onto.  A new chapter in my life is now beginning...I am excited!   The view from here is lovely......

      So I'll try to finish now.  Where was I....oh yes, I just finished talking about my first four days here.  Well, my flatmate finally arrived on Monday, and things really changed from there.  She showed me all the know's and how-to's at Handong and introduced me to some of the other English faculty.  That was such a refreshing day.  It was nice to open my mouth again and have some human contact.  Seriously, I don't think that I ever appreciated it so much!   The next 2 days we spent at a faculty retreat, for which we stayed in a really nice hotel.  It was great.  Not just the hotel :), but the retreat itself. Because Handong is a Christian university, the seminars were focused very much on integrating faith and learning....interesting stuff! Although the seminars just scratched the surface of the subject, it is something that is sort of a long term project for me since I aspire to be a tentmaking missionary/professor.  The big question is, how can I display Christ's light  in  my teaching?  I mean, if "the earth is the Lord's and everything in it" (ps 24), then there has to be a way to uncover the truth of God in any subject that is taught in schools, right? English lit for sure.  In grad school I hope to really throw myself into developing teaching techniques that incite discussion of literature in conjunction with philosophy and worldviews.  In another entry perhaps, I'll write about the connections that I see between poetry (I love poetry!) and Truth. For now though, I am trying to think of ways to integrate faith with language instruction.    I've met some really great people here so far. There are three other ESL teachers who are around my age: Joyce, Jo, and Ro...Joyce is from San Diego, Ro is a missionary kid who is white but grew up in Japan (and went to a Bible college in Seattle), and Joanne is Korean-Australian (born in Korea, went to Australia when she was three).  I really bonded with them because they are all very adventurous, strong sort of women.  They are total warriors for Christ, too.  Joyce also wants to be a tentmaker professor (of ESL) in a Muslim country someday, so we had a good talk about our visions as well as future-husband-stuffs :) (This is a random sidenote, but I have a great office on the fourth floor of a building in Handong, with my own desk and computer, and Joyce for an officemate.). Because of these people, as well as so many other God-ward faculty and administrators that I've met, I get this warm feeling in my heart when I think about being a part of this school.  Handong Global University's vision is to equip Christian leaders in many different areas of expertise to go out and serve the world,  especially the needy in Asia, and to nurture in their students godly character, equipped to share the good news of Christ .  I feel like all the faculty, or nearly all the faculty, are one in this vision, and see their jobs as more than just teaching.  Professors and students alike just really love and respect each other.  Case in point, today I saw a female student run up to a female professor, bow, and say in the most sincere voice, " Professor! You are back! I am so happy to see you! How was your missions trip?" They hugged and clasped hands as they talked.  It was a heart-warming sight, I tell ya.   It's neat, I get to pray aloud before starting my classes, and not only teach, but get involved in ministries.  Jo is heading up a brand new women's ministry that will seek to dispel the non-biblical, korean notions of what womanhood is, and train female students in biblical womanhood, which is beyond culture.  She's asked me to lead a Bible Study for it, which I am going to consider doing once I figure out how busy I am.  We are also going to start up some girls' sports teams (there are none, and all the sport courts are always dominated by males with females just watchin on the sidelines; this really bothers me).  I will be playing basketball again more regularly, yay! I played a couple games with some of the foreign faculty last Sunday, and it was so much fun.  I need to practice mah skills, hehe.  Despite all these great things, though, it is really weird being in a brand new place where no one knows you well.  It's weird to be the one that everyone is trying to figure out.  They won't say that they are trying to figure you out, but I think that it is a subconscious mechanism that turns on when anyone meets anyone new.  They're wondering what you like to do, what your talents are, how smart you are, what you think of them, etc.  I know because I do it too.  And since everyone I meet here is new to me, I am constantly...wondering.  So all of this is odd-- everyone wondering about me, and me wondering about everyone.  It is a very self-conscious process, which I am not proud of admitting, and so it is extra difficult to not do or do something because of how it might "look".  Like on Sunday, I had to consciously tell myself "don't go into the office if the only reason you are going is to look as diligent as the others".  And so I didn't go, because the reason would have been totally based on self-consciousness.  It's funny, because I don't like to work on Sundays anyway, but there was definitely a temptation....I didn't want to look lazy, although I am sure no one thought that of me! Being "the new one" has brought out the sinful part of me that wants man's esteem, when I should desire God's first and foremost.  I never knew that that impulse in me was so strong. I hate it.  Whenever it comes up, and especially when I give into it, I really realize how shallow I can be, and I hate it.  God's esteem is all that I  want  to want.   Lord, help me to reorient my desire for esteem from men to a desire for esteem  solely  from You.  What is man that I should fear him?     Okay, I think that I am pretty much caught up, but gosh, I still have other things I want to write about.  Tomorrow, or whenever I find time, I'll talk about some new reflections I've had on missions, both during my time in Europe as well as here.

      Okay, so I have finally found a moment to breathe in the midst of all the hecticness. School started today. My classes were ok, but it is definitely weird having an evening schedule, and even weirder teaching korean adults. As long as we are only speaking English in the classroom, it's good fun. But I have a feeling that if Korean enters the classroom, even an inkling of it, then it'll get all weird because of the whole honorific-who's-the-authority-here thing.  My students range between late twenties and ...um....I'd say late 40's.   I've been in Korea for about 12 days now, and boy has it been a mixture of experiences.  The first four days here were really difficult for me.  First of all, my flight to Pohang from Inchon was canceled, so I had to fly into Daegoo instead. From there, I took a taxi to the bus terminal, where I took a bus to Pohang.  Once I finally got to Pohang, I took another taxi to Handong.  Oh, did I mention that it was raining really hard? And that I was carrying two huge suitcases (a year's worth of stuff, you know), a small duffle, and a backpack, and that no one would help me? Not the taxi driver, not the bus driver, not anyone standing around.  I don't like to say it, but I really did feel sorry for myself.  Anyway, the story's not over.  I arrived at Handong, only to find out that it was a national holiday!! No one was around because everyone had the day off! So there I was with a heap of luggage, and nowhere to go.  I decided to put down my luggage anywhere dry, and started wandering around campus in search of a human being.  I finally came upon one building with its doors open, so I entered and eventually found a man sitting in his office. He told me that I was in the high school, that he didn't know anything about the university, and that he couldn't help me.  He was obviously at work on a holiday because he had a lot to do.  I felt really bad for bothering him.  But he was my only hope.  Fortunately, he took pity on me (it must've been because I looked like I was going to cry), changed his mind about not helping me, and started calling around.  He finally got in touch with the man I was looking for, Mr. Goo, who ended up coming 3 hours later to get me, because he was at a wedding.  When he finally arrived, Mr. Goo showed me to my apartment, helped bring up my luggage, and then left.    The following three days were a few of the loneliest days of my life.  My flatmate was not around yet, and I  did not meet a single soul.  I don't know why Gregg, the guy who hired me, told me that I had to be on campus by Aug 15th.....the faculty retreat was not until the 20th, and no one came back until the 19th.  Not only was I alone, but I did not know how to get into town, which is 20 minutes away by bus, and I had to survive on ramen purchased at the on-campus convenient store until my flatmate finally came and showed me around.  I am usually good at finding my way around (I mean, I just got back from backpacking through Europe!), but there were really just too many obstacles in this situation. I had no leads. Nowhere to purchase a map. No one to ask, unless I wandered into a random building again to ask the intricacies of getting into town when Handong buses have no signs at their bus-stops (students just "know" where the bus stops are in town).  So yeah, I was totally stuck. Oh, and in my apartment, you have to turn on the gas to get hot water and to use the stove.  You guessed it, I didn't know where the switches were, and so took cold showers and only used the microwave for a few days. It was a nightmare! I talked with my mom on day 2, and you wouldn't believe how I was bawling like a baby.:) haha  But you know, as bad as it sounds, I had some awesome times with the Lord during those lonely lonely days.  He was so real to me, because I was stripped of everything I knew, vulnerable and weak before Him.  Thank the Lord that my flatmate had a guitar lying around.  It and my Bible were lifesavers...I passed most of those days praising, reading the Word, or taking walks on Handong's beautiful grounds.  I felt so helpless, but I couldn't thank God enough for His grace and His steadfast love, which are new  every  morning. But I also learned in those four days that we are made to be around people...we need people to have fun with, to emphathize with, to encourage and to be encouraged by.  We need to need each other, to love each other, to experience God's character through each other. I remember being such an independent nut as a freshmen ("I don't need anyone but God...friends? I don't need friends. Jesus is my friend." ), but God has taught me a lot about human relationships since then. :) Love, relationship, fellowship...all these things are a reflection of God's Trinitarian Self.  Love originated IN God, exchanged amongst Himself-- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  With creation, that overabundance of love flowed down from Creator to creature, and we are blessed to experience an analogy of that perfect love in our human relationships.  We need it, it is necessary to our constitution, and yet Christ is the only one who can fulfill it completely and express it perfectly.   So yeah, I admit it, I need you guys.  Thanks for being my friends :). I see Christ in your love for me.  Ok, I am going to have to finish this later, because I am tired and I have class in the morn.

      HEY ALL!  I am back from Europe! But I am leaving for Korea tonight! Agh! I can't even begin to describe all the emotions I've been riding for the past couple of days. But anyways, at JoeMo's request, I wanted to update my blog (thanks for the note Joe!!!). :)   hehe, but you know, I can't fully update it right now because I am in a crazy mess trying to get everything packed. But I just wanted to let you all know where I've been, where I am, and where I'll be. So yup, I was in Paris for a month, learning French, and also traveled to England and Italy for a couple of weeks. It was incredible! Beautiful! And I learned soooo much about myself and about my God.  More on that later. Now I am going to Korea to teach at Handong Global University for one year! I am super nervous and apprehensive, but at the same time, excited and happy to be going. So I've been in LA for only 5 days, and I've just been seeing everyone I can down here and eating all the foods I know that I won't be able to find in Korea. ;)   It's been a rad summer, I tell ya! :)  Thanks for the care package everyone! It was so awesome! I filled my entire new album with all the pictures and notes you guys gave me. It made me miss all of you again soooo much! :) Oh and Chang, dude, thanks so much for the new set of sermon CD's and the John Owens book. Did you know that the other sermon CD's you gave me were like lifesavers in Europe for me and my friend??? And Keith, the frame is gorgeous...don't know about the pic in the middle of it :), but I looove the frame.  Ifang, thanks again for organizing the care package, and for visiting me here in LA!  Ok, all, I will definitely try to write a more thorough entry once I get to Korea. Whoa...I'll be bloggin from KOREA.

      For the past week, there have been sprinkling signs of fall, summer waving its last shade of goodbye. It's beautiful.  I think it's the sky that captures me the most.  So clear and serene and soft and piercing.  I've heard over and over again that fall in Korea is gorgeous, so I'm really looking forward to it.  This will be my first fall in the motherland. ^ ^   Chusok weekend was great.  Thursday we played two full court basketball games, both pick-up games.  Our team was made up of foreign faculty, and we played against students.  We won both times! It was rad. On Saturday I went bikeriding and horsebackriding (ie, we rode bikes to get to the horse ranch) with some internationals.  The rest of the break I mostly did a lot of chilling out and resting and thinking and spending quality time with my girlfriends Jo Joyce and Ro.   I remember Friday night was a particularly emotional evening for me . The moon was full, and the campus a ghost town because all the students were away.  I felt deeply lonely. Yet incredibly at peace. I took a long walk by myself, and my eyes kept welling up with tears. Whenever I looked up at the moon, I just wanted to fly up to heaven.  My friend Jo could tell that I was going through something, because when I got back she asked me if anything was wrong, that she had not yet seen me like this.  It was the weirdest mood. I got out my roommate's guitar and sang my heart out for hours after that. It felt really good.  I think that God works in peculiar ways sometimes, and in that moment of pain and peace, I was actually experiencing the deepest of joys. In the Word, joy is many times next to pain or suffering...like in James, "Count it all joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds."  Also Romans 5, 8, 12, 1 Thess 1,and Hebrews 10.  And 1 Peter 1 too. Which makes sense, because God brought Himself and us the greatest joy by sacrificing His Son....so in sacrificing, in putting to death, our "old man", it is going to be painful, but at the same time it releases the deepest joy to be in touch with the "new man" we have in Christ's resurrection.  "And the life that we live, we live to God..."    Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the  joy  set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.  Heb 12:2   But  rejoice  that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.   1 Pet 4:13

       night song   the cricket's persevering song droning in the undulating cool of black night brings my self to a niche of tranquil thought.  I think birds peck at the barren ground trees soar high in the reddened hills rivers carve at the mountain rock  and the moonlight sears my innermost parts profound tearing and joyful expansion in the same small moment   there is the pink of far off dreams but the dreams of now take birth here  they lead me where I will go in the horizoning truth as timid steps trace boldness  I follow on keep on singing  that bright undulating song

      Wow, it's been awhile.  In the past two weeks, I've been incredibly busy with classes and trying to get used to a split day/evening schedule.  At this point, I am constantly feeling tired.  A typical day: Wake up at 7, get ready, get into the office between 7:30 and 8 am.  Prep for my morning class, teach from 10-12.  After class, have lunch, prep some more and do other random things.  Go home, take a nap around 3 or 4. Eat dinner, and get back into the office by 6 pm to do some last minute prep before teaching again at 7 pm.  Teach a couple of classes, and finish around 10 pm.  Sure, I get a huge "break" in the middle of the day, but I feel like I am thinking about my classes all day long.  It's quite tiring.  I just haven't found the rhythm yet.      Of course, there are positives too.  I am getting to know Joanne and Joyce better by the day, and they constantly astonish me with their quirky personalities.  It's funny, if you want to know what they are like, they are like the two opposite sides of my own personality, but taken to the extreme in each case.  Joanne is very soft and thoughtful and poetic and single-minded and calm and passionate, and loves vinegar and kimchi more than I do (no kidding, today I saw her put vinegar in her cham-pong and jjajangmyun!).  Joyce on the other hand is talkative and extroverted and athletic and adventurous and strong and easily excited and very sensitive.  I see elements of myself in both of them, and I can't believe just how well we all get along.  It's been so awesome getting to know them.  The things we all have in common: passion for Christ, a love for teaching, a desire to remain overseas, and creative spirits.  I think that we really feed off of each other.  haha Last Saturday, we had a wild dance party.  10 in the morning, in our pajamas, dancing to Madonna and Cindy Lauper and Michael Jackson and Gangsta's Paradise and Rich Mullins .  Don't ask me about the music selection, I dunno what we were thinking.:) And I don't know if you can call it dancing either.  There was a good amount of hopping around and bashing into each other involved. Good times, I tell ya. ;)  Hey, you would've loved my version of "Thriller"! ^ ^ (  So yeah, they are great.  I love them.  And my students are wonderful.  I have had some really good lessons, but some humungo flops too. And yet the students are always encouraging and gracious.  They only care that I am trying my best, and that I come to teach.  My adult students are extra endearing because they come after long days at work, and some drive 40 minutes to an hour to get to the university.  It makes me want to teach them well.  It makes me want to give them the best English education I can give them.  A lot of the adult students aren't Christian, so Joanne and I are thinking of ways to bring Christ into the classroom.  The other night we taught them a praise song in English, so I played the guitar and we sang a duet.  They loved it.  We explained the song, that it was a love song to God, and then had them write their own poems using some of the same images and words.  One man whom I know is not Christian seemed genuinely touched, and expressed interest in learning some more praise songs ('Bible song,' he called it).  This is the same man who, for his introductory speech in my Public Speaking class, declared himself a miserable alcoholic and admitted that he attends Handong's evening courses to be around the "angels" he meets here.  Though he is misinterpreting Christ's light, I am glad that he is drawn to it.  I'm praying that one day he might come to know our Lord.  My undergraduate freshmen are really shy still, but I had a flop of a lesson today that actually had the unexpected effect of making them warm up to me.  Well, first let me say that being creative is risky.  I mean, I can easily give a rote English lesson straight out of the book.  Or, I can try to present the material in new and interesting ways that get the students practicing grammar constructions while having fun.  But the latter is more difficult, and has a greater chance of going awry.  Today, I tried to get the class to play this speaking game that was fabulous in my mind.  I mean I was really really excited about it.  But it didn't happen the way I imagined.  The students just couldn't do it.  The directions were too complicated.  I had to apologize to the class at the end of the period, and promised that I would revamp the game to make it run more smoothly.  I was totally bummed.  But you know, as the students were walking past me to exit the classroom, so many of them said encouraging things like, "Thank you for teaching us!" "Have a nice day!"  "See you on Friday!" which might seem like pretty normal comments to you, but it was  the way  they said it.  Beneath their voices and warm smiles, I heard "It's ok! We appreciate you trying so hard.  We don't hold it against you!" And that was sweet.   Honestly, I don't know how coherent this blog is.  I am so tired. Hey if you are praying for me, please pray that I do not get burnt out by this weirdo schedule. Hopefully I will get used to it soon.  Anyway, one more thing.  I have decided to lead a Bible Study for the Women For Christ ministry, and I am totally excited about it. We'll be studying the book of Ruth.  I will also be leading praise for it with another woman, Tara, who sounds like the Little Mermaid.:) Seriously, she has a dang good voice, so I think I'll just sing the back-up harmony, haha.  Agh, but I'll be playing the guitar!  Scariness.  What the heck am I doing playing guitar for praise?!  We have our first meeting tomorrow.  Hey, I still didn't get to write about missions, and now I've built it all up by keeping you in suspense for so long that when I finally get to writing about it, you'll be like, what the? :) what was the big deal?  hehe, but maybe next time.  I just felt like rambling today.

      I'm changing the title name of this page to "so hee", because I've come to really appreciate my korean name.  "So" sorta means "prayerful-hope", the same chinese character as the "so" in "so-mahng" in korean. "Hee" means "joy."  People are always telling me here that my korean name is very pretty. No one ever tells me that my English name is pretty.  ^ ^ Plus, English names don't carry the weight of meaning in them the way that Korean names do.  Each character means a lot, and the combination of two characters means even more, because the sum can equal more than the parts.  I think that my name, in part and in whole, is beautiful.  Anyone can call me So Hee if they'd like.  My korean friends from 98 call me So Hee, and I love it.

       dusk    in the furry spokes of the evergreen there resides a hush of spring even though winds rage in fury and angry rains whip the sky the essence of calm, the core of peace dominate my soul be buried with the dead and the cold but it anticipates resurrection as the spokes that flurry in the pines   in Him and through Him and by Him are all things   yet what will come already is and birth consumes death though dead it does appear though raging against each other back and forth. backward. forward. Life in the tree, spoke, rock. I see birth death resurrection   in Him and through Him and by Him are all things   and so the sky saddens around enveloping the land with an embrace of divinity the star-breasted mountains and gold-flecked trees  all face the fiery sun shining confidence the joyous roars of breeze-filled silence make room for the easeful flight of twilight birds and wistful cosmos   do you deny the spiritual? order and beauty fit together need each other truth embraces both with a persistent theme if all is material, then Order Beauty  Truth are What  the furry spokes of the evergreen at the hush of saddening dusk tell all   and in Him and through Him and by Him are all things

      Ok, last blog I said that it felt like San Francisco.  Well, now it is freezing cold! bbbrrrrrrrrrrrr! It feels like Chicago, except that the sky is very clear and the sun is shining.    I love it.  Yeah, you heard me.  I, lifelong Californian, love this weather.  There is something about it that is so...FRESH.  I love the feeling of bundling up in the morning and walking out into the cold, biting air, the sky a magnificent blue, the coniferous evergreens providing a backdrop for the deciduous red and orange trees.  It makes you know you're alive! Shivering from head to pinky toe, and the world alive with explosions of color. I've never experienced fall like this before.     I had such a fun time last week.  It was festival week, apparently something that all universities in Korea have once a semester.  Handong's is reputed to be pretty lame in comparison to other schools, but I had such a blast. I felt like a student again.  They had lots of good food at the pojangmahchah, which is basically a food fair.  I ate Uzbekistanian food and Pakestanian food and of course some "exotic" Korean foods like soon-deh and buttered-fried-half-dried-squid. Yummy. ^ ^  I played in the "Dream Team" obstacle courses with a team of 4 students and two professors (Joanne was the other prof), and we lost. :( hehe, but it was fun.  I watched the acapella concert, the dance competition, the singing contest, and the rock band festival. It was awesome seeing some of my students perform, because it gave me a more holistic view of them.  Some of them really surprised me with their talents! Oh and how could I forget? I finally got some long-pent-up dancing out of my system at the dance party last Thursday night. Some of my students saw me, but I don't care!  I seriously danced no holds barred. I danced so hard that my whole body was sore the next day. ^ ^ Oooooh, it felt sooooo gooooood.   I am getting to know all my students better, and believe it or not, I am  already  getting sad that I will have to say goodbye to them at the end of the semester. I'm trying to make the most out of each class, and I am thinking about what I want to do for them around finals time.  I think that I might invite my freshmen to my apartment and cook them a good home-cooked meal, since the dining hall here is incredibly disgusting and unhealthy.  Anyway. I am so happy these days. Life is excellent, and I love where God has placed me for now.  I just want to be a faithful steward of these blessings, and live my life in a way that really points to Christ.    One of my students came to my office for a makeup quiz today, and one of the questions on it was "Are you a Christian? If so, when and how did you come to know Christ as your Savior? If not, what kinds of questions do you have about Christianity?" I guess I should explain the quiz first.  I played "The Invitation" by SCC for them, and gave them a printout of the lyrics.  Then I asked some questions about the song, and the question I just mentioned above was the last question.  I did not grade it based on grammar, but on expression and quality of thought, because one thing that many korean students have problems with is just plain speaking.  They get so hung up on grammar that they are afraid to open their mouths.  And, since this is a speaking and listening class, one of my aims is to teach them that speaking is about expressing yourself to another person, that it's about communication, and not about how perfect your grammar is.  So that's the long story for why I gave this kind of quiz.    Anyway, all of the students said that they were Christian, which kind of surprised me, but then again this is a Christian university, and of course I was thankful to God for that.  But then this student came in today, and he wrote that he didn't believe in the existence of God. He was also annoyed with all the people he saw praying and crying in chapel.  He couldn't understand it.  However he did say, interestingly enough, that he had a suspicion that God brought him to Handong so that he might be saved.  It's so interesting to me that someone can think like that.  To say, "I don't believe in God," and yet refer to Him as real in a very indirect, subconscious way.  That's where I see the truth of Romans 1 in the so-called atheist.  So I wrote him a letter on the back of his quiz, asking him some questions, and talking a little about my own faith.  I offered to talk with him more about it, so I hope that he emails me or comes to visit my office.  I mention this incident with the hope that you will join me in praying for this student. His name is Thomas, and he's a cool kid.  There is something about his demeanor that is endearing. Kinda the quiet strong type. It makes me really sad that he doesn't know Christ.  I stumbled upon a verse today that I had never noticed before, but this morning it totally blew me away:  "Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known." 1 Cor 13:12 NIV  Actually, my Bible is the New King James Version, which reads:  "For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known."  This verse comes toward the end of the famous "Love is patient, love is kind..." part in Paul's letter to the Corinthians.  It comes right after the part where he says "love never fails, everything else will fail or cease or vanish, because everything else is only in part"( my paraphrase).  I think Paul is intimating that love is the true reflection of Christ, and therefore it should color everything we do. In preceding chapters Paul addresses the silly squabbles over spiritual gifts, and here he says, don't get so hung up with that foolishness, because love is the greatest gift, and everything is only expressed in part if not expressed with love.    What is astounding to me is the image that Paul sets up here in verse 12, and how it makes a surprising connection to the ". . .in part" and "love" theme of verses 8-11.  Christ has saved me, and therefore I am Christ-like in God's eyes.  When I look through the lens of the present, though, I find that the mirror is bad-quality, and so the reflection is inaccurate.  The thing is, I don't have access to  any  accurate mirrors, so I can never know what I really look like.  Right now, partial knowledge is as good as it gets.  But the day that I meet Him face to face, I will know  who I truly am , and when I look in the mirror, the face staring back will be Christ's!  What's more, the verse doesn't stop at "Now I know in part; then I shall know fully."  It goes on to say "even as I am fully known" or "just as I am also known."  So it's not that I will be like Christ only when I finally meet Him, but the beauty of Christ is in me now....and the way I "am known" by God  now  is the same "me" as when I will finally see my true self.  I know it sounds circular, but what touches me is that God knows me, the true me, better than I know myself.  And everyone knows that in biblical language, the word "know" means something much more intimate. It signifies a deep, profound love relationship-- a "knowing" at every level of body, soul, and mind.  If God knows me more than I can know myself, than His love for me must be far far faaaar greater than I can even begin to wrap my brain around.     As one of my friends said the other day, "I like to be loved."  I love to be loved too.  And this morning, the love I felt was out of this world. And I felt beautiful! I felt the gaze of God on me, and He was saying,  "You're a gorgeous one, you know that?" ^ ^ It gave me inspiration to live my day all out for Him, and what a great day it was. I am going to head off to go home now, and I think that I can honestly say that I really  lived  today. Didn't do anything spectacular, but I lived it with the energy of a soul-engraving truth.

      It's getting cooooold. I walked out of my apartment this morning, and it felt like San Francisco! Not as windy, but there was something about the air-- the chill, the smell, the shape and color of the clouds-- that made me think of and miss SF.  So all morning, flashes of San Francisco scenes have been invading my mind's eye:   the alleyway outside my SoMa apartment, crowded with cars......the view of misty mountains and Crystal Springs from the 280....the gloomy fog surrounding St. Emydius on a late Friday afternoon, just before FiCY.....briskly walking against the wind on Irving Street to grab a bite of Thai food or buy a boba drink....sitting inside The Canvas and drinking a warm chai latte bowl, watching the poofy jacketed, beanied San Franciscans outside....walking toward downtown with Jan (she has her hands stuffed inside her black jacket vest, while I, in my boots, am trying to keep up with her long strides)....sitting in Coffee Bean on Sacramento, studying for the GRE....having a late night snack at Lyon's with a huge group of YG kids and staff....chillin at 20 Poncetta with the Monday crew, trying to figure out where we want to eat dinner....playing pool at Jillian's...  *sigh* I suddenly feel homesick.  I miss you guys! Hope you are all doing well. Tell everyone at KCPC that I said hi please! I miss the YG kids. YG staff! Are you all still having those weekly dinners/book discussions?  I miss them.  This is a short week, because it's Chang Moon Festival time. I don't have classes on Thursday or Friday! Yay! haha, I sound like a student more than a prof, eh? ^ ^   I had a really good class this morning.  It was my class of housewives, and we had a discussion about the question "What makes a good family?"  It was interesting to hear what they had to say.  They are such a great group, and good mothers, I think.  I was surprised to hear that they have no problem saying "sorry" to their husbands or their children.  My mother hardly ever says sorry, and I attributed it to her koreanness, but I guess it's more just her personality.    I am also excited about my Freshmen Speaking and Listening class tomorrow morning.  I'm planning on starting the class by playing and discussing Steven Curtis Chapman's song "The Invitation".  I think they'll love it.    Teaching at Handong is the best. ^ ^

      I had a great weekend.  My ah-jum-mah students (housewives ^ ^ ) took me to Angang village and Oksuwon on Saturday.  Those two places are apparently the most famous places nearest Pohang, and they insisted on making a day out of it. I love my ah-jum-mah's, they are so sweet.  ^ ^   Angang is an old folk village that has been around since the period of the Chosun dynasty.  I saw the traditional homes of nobles and servants. Haha, it was kind of funny walking around with 12 other ah-jum-mahs.  They are such fun people though.  I think we were laughing the whole time. ^ ^ Oksuwon is a temple...it's funny, we didn't visit the temple...we just ate at a traditional korean restaurant nearby.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I am a big fan of ban-chan (korean side dishes) and they served the best banchan I have ever tasted!  After I came back to Handong, my freshmen day students and Joanne's freshmen day students had a soccer match.  Unfortunately, my class lost, but it was a good time.  We had dinner together afterwards, and then I bought everyone ice cream.  They loved me after that, ^ ^ even though it was really no skin off my back.  Ice cream in Korea is so cheap; let's see....I bought ice cream for about 25 people, and it cost me about 6 US dollars!   Joanne and I went shopping after that, and I bought a pretty trenchcoat. It's nice to treat myself once in awhile. :)       Sunday was a nice day too.  Service was refreshing, and I spent the day productively-- I did some reading, cleaning, playing the guitar and singing, napping.....and then I went to dinner with our EM pastor, his wife, and Joanne.  We ate a three course meal for 4000 won a piece, which is like 3 US dollars! Gooood fooooood.  I loved hanging out with them.  We had the best conversation.  Then when we got home, I played basketball with some students for a couple of hours.  I slept incredibly well last night.  Now that's what I call an ideal weekend.  I didn't go anywhere exotic or far away, but it was both relaxing and meaningful.  I miss you all. Hope you are doing well.   Inna: I am so worried about you....I will try to call you soon....it was only today that I was able to go into town to buy an international phone card (I can't call outside Korea without one).... Jan: I will write you back soon, I've been crazy busy, but you are in my prayers everyday. I think of you often. Ifang:  Merci beaucoup pour le message en ton blog! Tu me manque aussi, et je pense que tu es une bonne copine ^ ^.....merci pour tes priers, tu es dans mes aussi.....tu sais, je suis tres heureuse que as passe un bon temps en virginia.  tu le merites! (pardones ma grammaire...je suis une novice du francais... ) je t'aime.... Carm: I don't know if you read this page, but if you do, I am praying for you.  We have a lot to talk about.  I'll write you soon...

      This morning, I am inspired by the beautiful images in this poem by John Keats.  It's one of my favorites, and especially fitting for my present "autumn" mood.      To Autumn     Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness!	    Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;	  Conspiring with him how to load and bless	    With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;	  To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,	            And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;	      To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells	    With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,	  And still more, later flowers for the bees,	  Until they think warm days will never cease,	     For Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.	   	 Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?	    Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find	  Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,	    Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;	   Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,	    Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook	      Spares the next swath and all its twind flowers;	  And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep	    Steady thy laden head across a brook;	     Or by a cider-press, with patient look,	      Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.	   	 Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?	    Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,	  While barrd clouds bloom the soft-dying day,	     And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;	  Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn	    Among the river sallows, borne aloft	      Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;	  And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;	     Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft	    The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft;	      And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.

      I'm tired. Midterms are coming up. Just finished writing a test, and typing up a poem. Going home now, even though I told myself that it was about time I updated my blog.  I don't know, I've been sad this week (well, it's only Tuesday).  Just some random things happened yesterday that put me in a strange mood.  And it's too beautiful outside. It's so beautiful it hurts. Really bad. I took a walk today on a trail behind my apartment building that I had not been on before.  It's by far the best trail at Handong.  I think I'll walk there everyday while the weather is nice, because it is restorative. So pretty and peaceful.  Today the air was crisp and cool, the sun shining through the trees, and me all alone. With God, but all alone in body.  It was very very quiet, save the steady chirping of crickets, the buzzing of bees, and the wind rustling the trees. I prayed to Him who loves me and cares for me, the kind of praying where it feels like your heart is reaching as far as possible, and I especially prayed about the people that I love who are struggling.  And then I just felt incredibly lonely.  I wanted to scream and cry at the same time, but all I could do was let my eyes fill with tears.  I feel like this is the same story over again from my last blog, but oh well. Perhaps it's the theme of my life right now.  Because I want to say that at the same time I was sooooooo at peace, and soooooo grateful to be where I am. I would say that if I could draw a picture of how I feel, my emotions would look like a chestnut.  The hard, dark shell is the pain, the white inside the joy.  It's what's at core.  But the shell protects the core, helps it remain untouched and pure......the shell gets the brunt of the elements....it's supposed to be there....This loneliness is good. It is special, if only because I feel it so deeply, although I think it is more than that.  Sorry if I am being cryptic. Tonight I am writing just for myself to understand.

      jeen-jjah ahship-ddah.  I can't believe I have only two weeks left, and only one teaching week left.  Actually, my evening classes are officially over tomorrow, but my day class has three more classes: Friday, Tuesday, and next Friday.  A couple of weeks ago, my undergrads put together a bulletin board for our class on the intranet server, and I love it.  They talk to each other, comment on class ^ ^, and even have a 200 question personality questionnaire circulating to help us get to know each other. At the moment, they are trying to plan another class get-together as well as an end-of-the-year party.  In the last few entries, three students were discussing how sad they were that the "end is drawing near".... I wrote to the list and expressed my feelings too.  I am quite sad right now. Only three more classes, and then I have to say goodbye to them. They'll be sophomores next semester, so I won't be teaching any of them....:(    I don't know, do I sound weird?  I told my TA about how sad I was about saying goodbye to this one special class, and  I asked him whether or not he thought it was weird that I was so attached to them.  He laughed, and said yes.    Maybe it is weird, but I don't care.  I can't thank God enough for this experience.    My undergrads aren't the only ones that are special to me though.  One of my night classes, English Public Speaking, is also special to me.  They are all young adults, and I am so proud of them.  They have been working full time and attending night classes for the past four years, and this semester they are finally graduating from Handong University with a B.A. in English!  I admire them greatly.  Today they gave their final speeches, and it was amazing to me just how much they have improved since the beginning of this semester.  That's one thing about teaching language...the fruits of your labor are definitely more obvious than teaching something like literature.  Fortunately, we still have a special dinner to look forward to during finals weeks, because their final project is to put together and execute a program for a "special occasion".  I can't wait; we're going to reserve a room in a restaurant, and highlights of the evening will probably be the "roast" (they're roasting me!) and the graduation speech. ^ ^  And of course there are my ah-jum-mahs.  Their class is for no credit.  They have no tests, no homework, no grades.  It is so refreshing to teach them, because they really come purely to learn.  And every class, they bring a plethora of hot drinks and yummy snacks. ^ ^ What a bright, intelligent group of women! We've had some amazing discussions over the course of the semester.   This is another group that I will not be teaching after this semester, because I have been moved "up" to teach two undergrad classes next semester.  While that is good news, I suppose, I'm really really going to miss this group of women.....  Goodbyes are so hard. . . . :(

      *sigh*  Another Thursday has passed and it'll be Friday in just an hour and a half.  These days I feel as if the weeks are running faster than I am, and I'm just trying to catch up with time.  Only three weeks left in the semester. One more teaching week, dead week, and then finals. I repeat, it all passed by  so  quickly. The other day I looked back at my first blogs in Korea, and that four day trauma of isolation and helplessness seems just like yesterday.  And while I am now enjoying myself working and living at Handong, the questions that always hover over me are "Where has the time gone? Am I really making the most of life? Am I taking advantage of every opportunity available to me?"  One of the things I fear the most is just letting life slip by without having wrought any meaning or purpose or change...doing "to do", not doing "so that...".   I think my first years in college were like that, when I had no direction whatsoever. I get embarrassed answering the question, "What was your major?" because when I say, " I double-majored in Human Biology and English Literature," people get all impressed. But I don't like that sort of reaction at all.  I didn't double major because I was so smart or so driven, but simply because it took me so long to discover my passion.  Basically, I first majored in Hum Bio by default. I didn't know what I was interested in, and so I thought, "hm, my sister's major seemed pretty cool. I'll just do that." And I just did it. I floated through that major for awhile until I started getting really interested in my medical anthro and bioethics classes junior year. These classes led me into "fuzziness" (stanford term for the social sciences and humanities; "techie" refers to more quantitative fields like math and science and engineering), and for some reason that summer I ended up taking a course at Berkeley on Shakespeare.  It was that summer in which I fell hard for English literature, and by graduation, I had begun and finished the English major in one year with a mind to eventually get a PhD. So you see, for most of my college career, I had absolutely no idea what the heck I was doing.  It's nothing to be proud of. So when people act all impressed about my double BA, I feel compelled to tell them the whole story, and I usually do. Or nowadays, I just say that I majored in English.  Even though I look back on my Stanford experience with much satisfaction, one thing I wish that I could have done differently is found my passion sooner.  I suppose that you can't control something like that, but I still regret (um, I'm actually thinking of a korean word "ashiwuh", which doesn't have quite an accurate translation into english...but Inna, you know :)) the time lost.  Since then, I am always afraid of "losing time,"  even though I am not sure where I could be losing it.  It sounds silly, and yet it is so real in my life.  From the big things like trying to decide how long I want to stay in Korea, or what I should be doing to get ready for grad school, or staying in touch with friends, or doing stuff for the women's ministry here, to the small things like being on top of reading certain books or writing poetry or brushing up on languages or practicing guitar, the common theme of my "to do" list is "don't lose time."  But it gets overwhelming when I find myself with a checklist a mile long of "things to do".     I think that if my college years were on one extreme of not knowing what to do, I am now on the other extreme of wanting to do too much.  One ahjumah said to me the other day, "Sandy, you have to choose only a few of your many interests and hone them.  Otherwise you won't be good at anything." When she said that, I knew that she was right, but I don't know what interests I want to let go of.  It's not so cut and dry like that.  And so I suffer from knowing that I might always be a jack of all trades and master of none.   Geez, I began this entry with the intention of finally getting to the topics of friendship styles and foreign friends, but now I have no energy to make the connection.  Well, I was basically going to say that another thing that really takes time is friendships, and that the time factor is complicated by the style factor.  I've learned by trial and error that different people espouse vastly different approaches to friendship, and that this makes for the kind of friendships that only last in phases, or the kind of friendships that end up modifying both people....I know I am being irreducibly vague, but I am too tired to be detailed and specific right now. Whoa, I feel totally tired all of a sudden.  Anyway, and then I was going to go on to talk about how the time factor and the style factor are again compounded with complication if the friend is foreign.  So ideally, foreign friendships should have the most time invested into them, that is, if you aspire to intimacy and depth of relationship....but at least in my experience, the opposite always seems to happen.  There never seems to be enough time or opportunity to see my foreign friends or spend time with them or stay in touch with them.  I might write more about this later, I might not, but the last thing I want to say is that when I look back on this semester, the one thing I do regret is not having spent more time with my korean friends from 98.  Several of them are graduating this semester, and it makes me sad to think that if we are having such a hard time keeping in touch while they're still on campus, is there any hope for us to remain friends after they leave? In the past I have definitely experienced the resurrection of friendships that I thought I had lost, but it seems next to impossible when there is thrown into the mix a language barrier and a cultural barrier and an ocean to separate you.  This has been on my mind a lot these days.  And the weeks keep running.  And Sang Hua still hasn't called me back. Where has all the time gone? What were we so busy doing?

      Agh! There is so much that I want to write about that I went ahead and logged onto my account on Joanne's computer, even though it's 12:30 am and both Joyce and Joanne have already gone to bed. I should go back to my own apartment (I live just above them) and get to bed too. But some quick notes before I go. I want to write about a very interesting conversation that I had with Joanne today about friendship styles.  I also want to respond to Dave Hong's comment on Korean vs American vs Korean Americanness.  And I want to write about the things I learned from a book I just finished today by Ravi Zacharias called  Jesus Among Other Gods .  And also about my personal difficulties and hurts with foreign friends, largely due to the language barrier, yet despite that my special love for them. Actually, each of these could take up an entire blog, and you know how long my blog entries get. Don't blame me if I don't get to them all.  ^ ^    What I can quickly write about is the dinner party I threw at my apartment last night for my undergrad frosh. 12 came, a perfect number for the size of my apartment. Any more than that, and people would have been poking out the windows. I cleaned and cooked, (no kidding) for 3 hours on Friday night, and all day Saturday nonstop from 10-6! My right arm is sore from mixing and cutting and stirring, etc. Can you believe it? I never knew you could get sore from cooking.  I cooked truly Korean style, and I must say I was very proud of myself!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bulgogi, jap chae, dakdoritang, mapo dubu, haemul jon, and side dishes which I made the night before.   I cooked enough food for twenty people though (because 18 had signed up to come), so I have heaps of leftovers.  We had so much fun. I really got to see a side to my students that I don't get to see in the classroom.  We played games that I have played at home, except koreanized. Dibbydibbydip, dip dip dip except you say "bani bani bani, dang gun dang gun", which means rabbit rabbit rabbit, carrot carrot, while you make these silly motions with your hands. Oh my goodness, it's absolutely hilarious. And then we played Thumper, but the "assa!" korean style....I seriously think korean signs are funnier than the ones I've seen at home.  We also played Do You Love Your Neighbor in English, although they did have a korean way which no showed me because they don't know that I can speak korean.:)  But one technical difference is that when the chosen person says "Yes", only the two people next to that person must switch seats, whereas at home, everyone has to switch seats.  The fun thing about that game is that my apartment is so small that we were crawling over each other and falling on each other and bruising each other to get to the places we wanted. Ah, sometimes it is so refreshing to be juvenile! After a certain number of "outs" there was a penalty. I seemed to always mess up! I ended up singing and dancing for them (yes, two different penalties...I'm horrible at playing games).  You have to understand that I'm their "gyo soo nim", korean for "professor".  They were just tickled to death that their gyo soo would sing and dance for them. I thought it was funny too. hehe. Good times. I love my students. This frosh class is especially special to me. They are doing their oral presentations this week, which are basically group skits, and I am really looking forward to them because these students are super creative.  It'll be entertaining for sure. ^ ^ And because we'll have time left over after the presentations on Tuesday, I am going to teach them my most recent favorite praise song, "You Are Holy".  Actually it's been my fave for a year and a half now, ever since I first heard it in on the ex-kcpcYG-staff Cancun trip.  That's a great song, totally God-centered. You know, it has a two part chorus, and it goes  You are Holy (echo) You are mighty You are worthy Worthy of praise  I will follow I will listen I will love you All my days  (women sing) He is Lord of Lords He is King of Kings He is Mighty God  Lord of everything He's Emmanuel He's the Great I am He's the Prince of Peace Who is the Lamb He's the Living God He's my saving grace He will reign forever  He is Ancient of Days He is Alpha Omega  Beginning and End He's my Savior, Messiah,  Redeemer and Friend  He's my Prince of Peace I will live my life for HIm  (I'm too lazy to write the men's part)  Actually, could someone tell me which group sings this song so that I can download it?  At sometime I should also write about the negative aspects of being in Korea at Handong, since all my entries are almost always about the things I love here.  But it's because the positives totally outweigh the negatives. Ok, add that to the list, but like I said, don't blame me if I don't get to them all.

      The student that I mentioned in my 10/29 blog wrote me back.  This was his email:  ----- Original Message -----  From:  To: Sandra Chi  Sent: Tuesday, November 05, 2002 12:30 PM Subject: hi sandra chi..thank you for your writing.    Dear Prof. Sandra Chi   Thank you about your write of back of listening quiz's paper.  Actually I had wanted to know about god's existence.  But nowadays I didn't want. Because last semester I was effort to know.  So I can not anything. My life became a hard.  After all I determined I am never go to church, and didn's effort to know about the god.  Sorry..But I am glad that meeting you in this semester, in handong.   ^^;;    P.S.  I wanted to express my thinking but my English ability too bad.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- When I received this email from him, I don't know, it just made me sad.  If you don't understand what he's saying, he's basically saying that last semester he searched for God but life only became harder, and so he's decided never to go to church again, or make any more effort to know God.  It took me awhile to actually write back to him because first of all, you can tell from his email that he doesn't want to talk about it, and secondly, there was so much that I wanted to say that I had to filter through it all and simplify it into a readable email for someone who speaks English as his second language.  And I finally wrote him back late last night:  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (I'm sorry, this is kind of long. You might need your dictionary ^ ^ )   Hello Thomas! Thanks for writing back.  I understand that the search for truth can be difficult, but don't give up.  Salvation through Christ will not make your life easy, but you will discover the meaning of life, a peace that surpasses understanding, and a deep joy.  I know that you have decided to stop making any effort to know about God, but I think you will find that this does not make life any better, or any easier.  Someday you will come back to the question of His existence, the meaning of your life, and what happens after death.  What is this life about, if you and I are a result of chance, only to die into nothingness? I'm sure you've thought about that, and I'm sure you do not have an answer yet....which is why I know that you will eventually have to search for the truth again.     What I can tell you is that Christianity is the truth, and the only truth.  I know it with every part of my being, Thomas.   I really really do.  And I have studied many subjects, been to many different places in the world, met many different kinds of people, and the truth of Christianity has only become clearer to me with time.  If you ever do have any questions, please come talk to me or write me an email.  Did you know that I can read Korean? You can write in Korean if you'd like, although I will write back in English. ^ ^   I am so glad to have met you this semester, Thomas. You have a quiet, strong spirit.  I have been praying for you, and will continue to do so.  Hey, I hope to see you at the dinner at my house this Saturday! It'll be fun!    See you on Tuesday,  Sandra    You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. Jeremiah 29:13 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I know it's funny that I prefaced the email with that parenthetical remark, but my email is pretty long for an ESL speaker. :)  Anyway, I pray that he understands the email, and that God continues to work in his heart.  I was in a quandary because I wanted to make the message more Christ-centered, whereas it came out sounding more person-centered, i.e. what God can do for you, how Christianity will make your life better, etc.  But I suppose that when you are trying to reach an unbeliever, you have to meet them where they are, and from his email you can see that he's wondering what the heck he needs God for.  He's not even at a place to understand what it means "to live a life that brings glory to God."  If you happen to remember, please pray for Thomas.    In other news Joyce and Ro got a car (they are sharing)!  This means that we can go places on the weekends, and not have to rely on the bus.:) On Saturday, the day they got the car, we went to Emart and I bought stuff to basically redecorate my whole living room.  My apartment was so blah before, but it's amazing what a few sofa pillows, wallhangings, tabletop accessories, and a new non-flourescent floor lamp can do to the ambience of a living room.  I feel like I moved into a new apartment! I love it...after redecorating, I just wanted to sit in my living room all day.:)  I also bought the missing string for my flatemate's guitar, and it makes such a difference having all 6 strings...yes, until now I've been playing with only five strings.  So last night I was blissfully happy sitting in my living room, playing the guitar, and singing for a couple of hours.  But anyways, back to Saturday.  In the evening we met two other friends and the 6 of us (Me, Jo, Joyce, Ro, Mark from Australia, and Dae Young from Korea :))squished into the Elantra and drove all the way to Kyung Ju for some Italian food.  It wasn't as good as the Italian in Italy, of course, but it was pretty good.  They had a delectable hot chocolate though.  And their tiramisu was yummy.  We even had some red wine imported from Italy!  In any case it was so nice to get out of Pohang.....  Boy, do I miss North Beach SF.  And I miss Florence Italy.  Florence had the best pasta and white wine I have EVER tasted in a little restaurant south of the Arno River.  That was just this past summer, but those days seem so far away now.  Inna, what are you up to? I miss you all of a sudden.

      I am in Uljin at a hot springs resort with jan and her fam.  It's been soooo fun. I love jan, and I love her family.  Her grandparents are really sweet, and totally cute! It makes me wish that I had grandparents....I don't have any because my father's parents passed away when he was young, and my mother's father passed away when she was young, and my one grandmother passed away a couple of winters ago.  I've never had grand parents .  So it's such a joy for me to get to know jan's grandparents. They're the best.  Her grandfather is really smiley and sharp and active, even though he is eighty years old.  He has adopted me as his grandchild via a pinky swear. :) Her grandmother is super cute, with a laid back, laughing personality.  She is so sweet that I often have these random urges to bear hug her.  It's cool seeing Jan and her family interact. Jan and her brothers are so chill. I feel totally at home with all of them.  I can't believe Eddie is getting married...I keep imagining him and his wife with mini Eddie's running around.  I think Eddie is going to make a great dad.^^  Jan and I have officially done everything together. ^^ We shared a bed when we lived in a tiny room in SF, and now we've even gone to the mo-gyok-tang together.  She's my soul sista. hehe It's been really great spending time with her again! The other night we stayed up and talked until the wee hours of the morning....we caught up on life, and realized that we are really growing up.  It's funny comparing ourselves now to when we were freshmen in college.  Jan says that I was like a bunny, and I said that she was like a giraffe.  And she said that now I am "still bunnyish with black panther undertones", and I said that she is like a tigress. I am not going to explain. ^^ Who knows what made us think of each other in terms of animals.  I am taking Jan with me to Handong tomorrow, since we'll be spending the day in Kyungju, and Kyungju is very close to Pohang.  We're going to stay in Pohang until Monday morning. Jan will be the first of my friends to see some the places and people at Handong that I always write about! I am so excited!

      It's Christmas morning....I just woke up.....and lo and behold...IT'S SNOWING!!!!!!  I was just on the phone with Janice, squealing and jumping up and down because of it.   What a delightful sight.  I am filled with wonder and awe. Snow is amazing isn't it? It covers everything and makes even dirty, battered things look charming and pure.  And the tiny flakes falling from the sky are so light that they swirl around thousands of times, dancing with the air, before they finally meet the ground, a fluffy, white blanket.  I love snow.  It's one of life's small miracles.    But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.  This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger." Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,   "Glory to God in the highest,  and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."

      Now that the semester is over, I've been consumed by a reflective mood.   Where do I begin?   Well, a couple of you will recognize what I write next from recent emails, but I wanted to blog about it, so I hope it's ok if I repeat myself. I pretty much copied and pasted a lot of it, but it's true to what's whirling about in my mind even at the moment...  All in all, I am overwhelmingly satisfied with my first 5 months in Korea. They were probably 5 of the most fulfilling months of my life...that's a bold statement, but I feel so blessed to be able to say it confidently. I guess it's hard to define "fulfilling," but I think it has to do with enjoying and growing in all aspects of my interests and gifts to the glory of God . . . and I've realized that Handong lets me integrate all of me into fluid, focused, fervent living . . .   This is my life...this is what I want to do for the rest of my life...I realize now that I am not limited to teaching in only secular universities overseas, but perhaps Christian ones like Handong too. And that I don't even have to be overseas anymore. It just depends on where the Lord leads me I guess. I used to think that teaching at a Christian university was a cop out of sorts. I mean, why enclose yourself in a place where the gospel has already been reached? But it is exactly that sort of thinking that God might have wanted to rework in me by bringing me here....living and working at Handong has taught me what a powerful thing is to throw your whole self into "making disciples of all nations," and that the Great Commission is a process, not a moment. And so the moment someone accepts the Lord as Savior is not more or less important than his/her growth in the knowledge of God and in being a living sacrifice for Him. Anyway, in my day class, I found out that two of my female students want to be missionary doctors! And another girl wants to be an international lawyer advocating victims in developing countries. It was such an encouragement to me to hear these things...it humbles me to know that I contributed a small part (even if it is just English language skills :)) in helping to equip these women to be the light of Christ in the world. But you know, one of the ways I tried to integrate faith and learning this semester was to emphasize dynamic expression rather than by-the-book grammar, and to give my students a chance to write or talk about faith-related issues in English. It was so exciting to teach like that, because Handong not only gives me the freedom to do so, but encourages me to do so....  And so I've changed my thinking (which by the way, was totally subconscious...I didn't even realize that I was thinking this way until God brought it to light and challenged it). I don't think it is a "lesser" work to be a missions mobilizer for example, or an educator in a Christian insititution.   I still want to study English lit though, and that is the one thing that is lacking by staying here....I better keep up with the field even while I am teaching language here. Actually, I might have an opportunity next semester to teach an Intro to American and British Lit class...but that's only if they can't find faculty to hire to cover for an Eng Lit prof who is going on sabbatical next year. I guess I can't ask you to pray that they won't find someone to hire ^^, but you can pray that God provides me a way to maintain and nurture myself in that area of study....  Another related topic that's been on my mind is this: How does marriage relate to my dreams and passions and goals and calling in life?  I mean, I could plan out my life down to each micro-detail if I wanted to, since I am single at the moment....but if I get married someday, of course there would have to be some give and take in matching my plans with his (whoever "he" is, but I am talking about my future husband) plans.  I don't know God's mind, and it's times like this that I especially realize that His thoughts are so far higher than my thoughts.  But when I try to think about it logically, it seems that God's plan for two to become one would include meshing two life plans together so that there is compromise on both sides...perhaps.  But I also realize that not everyone is like me.  Not everyone has their whole life planned out. The funny thing is, I am almost expecting God to revise my plan for my life, and show me differently, because He's already done that several times before in BIG, rocking-my-world ways. I know that I've said this before, but whenever a plan for life becomes MY plan instead of GOD's plan, He always shows me how my plan was just a small piece of something larger.  That might not make sense to you, but in my life, again and again God has used convictions to build upon other convictions such that the original convictions seem bunk, but they aren't, because I would not have found my way to new convictions without the older ones.  Dizzying, I know.    He is doing that now, actually, especially in relation to the bit I wrote earlier about where I see myself teaching.  That's a HUGE change, actually, when I really sit down and think about it.  It almost brings me back to square one...I don't have to be overseas...so I could be anywhere.  But the one remaining element of what might seem like a dead conviction is that whatever I do, wherever I am, I am a missionary.  Simply because I am a child of God and I can't help but carry in this earthen vessel the treasure of the risen Lord Jesus.  Simply because I know that I was created to bring glory to God.  Simply because I know that it's part of my covenant relationship with Him.  And that change in mindset is significant in terms of  how  I want live my life, though a haze seems to once again occlude the particulars at the moment. And so I might even end up in the States. Or in Korea. Or wherever, who knows? I think that I am truly "open" to God's leading now, whereas before I  said   that I was "open," but I really wasn't, because deep down inside I didn't think that places like the U.S. and South Korea needed any more Christians.  Hey, I'm just being honest.  Recently, a friend's mother asked me, "Do you like Korea? Do you want to live here or in America?" And I honestly didn't know what to say.  All I could say was, "I want to follow God, and anywhere is good for me." I really meant it when I said it.  Perhaps a husband has to do with where I'll ultimately end up.  Or not.  Will I get married? Who can guarantee that for me?  Or maybe I am just playing with the idea of celibacy because of a subconscious desire to have complete control over my life.  And if that's true, then I need to face the music, because complete control is a myth anyway.  Besides, I sincerely and passionately want my life to be led by God.  But here's where I see how my fallen nature could attempt to twist something good (celibacy) into a self-righteous means for justifying motivations of the heart that are ultimately rebellious toward God.  Anyway, I really can't tell which it is right now.  I can't tell whether or not the idea of celibacy rolling around in my head is from God, or just me wanting to be God.   But if I am to get married, what do I really want in a husband? And how much am I willing to compromise and revise my vision for my life, taking into account the fact that I might not be living by myself, but joined as one to a lifelong soulmate?   Why all this rumination on marriage? Am I lonely? Not really. I feel fine.  But then again, I can't deny that a part of me is profoundly lonely.  But that's part and parcel of an existence apart from God.  That's another thing that has been an ongoing reflection this whole year. While an egocentric loneliness can be debilitating, a loneliness that molds the soul to reach heavenward is rejuvenating I think.  Sometimes I think that Christians can be more lonely than non-Christians, because when you think about loneliness, it can be compounded by knowing non-loneliness...take me for example.  I think that I have more potential to feel romanticly lonely, now that I have had a serious boyfriend, than when I never knew what it was like to be romanticly involved.  I experienced love, and therefore there's a larger hole to fill, in a sense, now that it' s gone.  But what is the essence of non-loneliness? True love, or true satisfaction, which is ontologically objective in Christ.  So we Christians, who live in "the now and the not yet,"  vaccillate between two incomplete states of regeneration and fallenness (I'm saying this totally from a "felt" standpoint, because I know that I am a saint in the eyes of God), between tasting the goodness of God and desiring the empty pleasures of the world.  I guess it would be more accurate to say that Christians have a more focused loneliess, which can therefore be more intense, than the vague, amorphous loneliness that a non-Christian must feel....  This is all to say that while I might feel lonely, I think that I will still feel lonely even after I am married.  And that I don't have to be married.  I think that I could live a single life if God called me to one, because then of course He'd give me the means and the strength to do it....though if I were to speak frankly, I'd rather be married. I'm sorry, my mind has been running around in circles these days, and this blog entry is a reflection of it.

      It's been awhile.  I was buried under a towering mass of papers to grade last week, but somehow I made it out alive.  Now I am in Seoul, at my eemo's place.    Despite the heaps of work I had to finish before leaving Pohang, I got a good amount of playing in there too.^^  Let's see, well last Wednesday was my birthday, and it was the best birthday I've had in a really long time.  In college, my birthday always fell on finals week, so neither I nor my friends usually had time to celebrate.  And last week was finals week at Handong too, so I wasn't expecting much, especially since Jo Joyce and I already had our party the weekend before.  However the day before, when I gave my freshmen their final, they asked me to meet them the next day in the cafeteria at 6 pm.  I was happy, because I always love to see my freshmen, and also because I knew that I was in for a "surprise" birthday party, hehe.  So that day, I got to see my three favorite classes at Handong ( I talked about them in my 11/28 blog).  I went out to lunch with my ahjummah class, and that was really fun.  We ate some gooooood hanshik food.   Right after I got back, I was called into a colleague's office, and there our department had cake and presents for all December birthdays.  It was sweet.  The pastor's wife, Min, cross-stitched a picture for me!  Later, one of my freshmen brought an entire cake and ice cream and a rose to my office! I was so touched that I almost cried.  I couldn't eat the cake by myself though, so I took it with me to meet my freshmen at 6pm in the cafeteria. When I got there, they already had a cake for me, which means that I had two cakes! It was cute-- they sang happy birthday to me twice, once in English, and once in Korean, and I got to blow out two sets of candles!^^ What fun. hehe. They gave me a pretty blue plaid scarf, too.  Sooooo sweet.  You know, Handong students have a funny custom for eating birthday cakes.  I started to cut one of the cakes into nice, congruent slices, when one of the students stopped me, gave me a pair of chopsticks, and told everyone to dig in.  So we ate the cakes "family style," if you can imagine! And I had the goofy idea of giving each group 2 minutes per cake, after which we had to switch.  Haha, so we were really digging in because we wanted to get the most of each cake.  We ate and talked and took pictures for about an hour before I had to go meet my Public Speaking class for their final project, which was to produce a "special occasion" and give "special occasion speeches."    When I got to the restaurant, I was pleasantly surpised by the fancy room they had reserved, and by how sharp everyone looked.  But nothing compares to how impressed I was when the speeches actually began. The execution of the evening's program was seamless and smooth, and those speeches were the best that my students had given all semester, perhaps because the night was so meaningful.  My speech students are seniors, so the theme of the night was graduation-- reminiscing about their earlier years at Handong, and looking ahead toward the future once they leave.  I was very very proud of them.  The funniest was the roast.  Julie and Jean roasted me, and did a really good job of imitating me and my quirkiness.  The other students were practically rolling on the floor laughing, while my cheeks were sore from smiling and blushing so much.    Anyway, when the speeches were over, we ate dinner and just chatted for awhile.  They really surprised me though, when they turned off the lights and brought out a lighted birthday cake for me! I had no idea that they knew it was my birthday, since I never told them! But I guess one of the students works in the administrative office, and she found out about it.  The cake was quite elegant, and they gave me a chic scarf and hat set.  After eating cake, we went to norebang and sang our hearts out until midnight. They made me sing "I Will Always Love You" to them, and at the moment, the lyrics were actually pretty true and sentimental. haha, really, we all teared up!  So that was my birthday.  It was special.  Check out some pictures from that day  urlLink here .    Another wonderful day was last Saturday.  I met 15 of my froshies and we went downtown.  What a full day! First, we ate lunch together (), and then we went to norebang, and then I treated them to parfait and cocoa at Cafe Arabica (where we also took over a room and played games for a couple of hours!), and then we went to eat dinner (), and then to eat ice cream at Baskin Robbins.  By the time we got to Baskin Robbins, several people had already left here and there in order to catch buses/trains to go home for winter vacation.  The few of us left (I think there were 6 of us) then caught the bus to Sunrise Park, where we hiked all the way to the top.  From there you can see a view that looks like the San Francisco Bay at night.  There we ended the night singing Christmas carols.   When we got back to school, I was unbelievably sad to say goodbye to them for a whole three months.  And not only that, but I was sad that they wouldn't be my students anymore come next semester....:(    *sigh* Life is full of goodbyes, isn't it?  It seems like as soon as you say hello to someone special, goodbye is always just around the corner.

      Last night Joanne, Joyce, and I threw a December birthday bash for ourselves.  Joanne's birthday is today (the 8th), mine is the 11th, and Joyce's is  the 26th.  We, as well as Ro, invited about 2-3 people each, so it ended up being a sort of random group of people since we don't all have the same friends.  I was a little worried about what the dynamic would be like for such an odd mix, but it ended up being really fun.  I invited my korean friends So Hyun, Evan, and Sung-jeh oppa, and they did very well in the English-dominant setting.  I was very proud of them. :)   The party was actually also a Christmas party, so Jo Joyce and I were madly running around downtown several hours before the party trying to get gifts for our friends.  I was incredibly stressed, because the party was at 8, and I only started wrapping the gifts and writing cards at 7:40! But it all worked out somehow. ^^ This is how the night went: we made introductions, mingled, had ice cream, sang happy birthday, ate cake, exchanged presents, sang Christmas carols, sat around and talked, sang Christmas carols again, except hilarious renditions this time (our Aussie friend Mark did Silent Night muppets style, country style, la bamba style, simon and garfunkle style, and more on his guitar!).  Singing Christmas carols with this crowd was really special because it was such an international group of people...songs were sung in English, Korean, Russian, Japanese, and German last night!  Oh, and Australian too...haha, you wouldn't believe how differently they sing "Away in the Manger" and "O Come All Ye Faithful".   When all the students left, we opened a bottle of wine, toasted ourselves, and settled down into more serious conversation for awhile.  Mark also sang us two of his most recently written songs...it was something else.  I had such a good time.  I am really blessed to have the kinds of friends I have in Korea.    Anyway, late last night after the party, I got a call from the pastor's wife, Min.  And guess what she asked me? She asked me if I would sing a special praise song on Sunday(today) since the person who was supposed to do it got called away to Seoul in an emergency.   I was like...uh.....don't really want to....  but then she got her husband (the EM pastor) on the phone, and he begged me to do it because this was the last English Sunday service before the long vacation and therefore a special service. I don't know what I was thinking, but I agreed to do it, even though as soon as he asked me I got these terrible butterflies in my stomach, and I had to do everything I could to stop my body from trembling violently.  When I was younger, I had terrible stage fright, and those reactions are remnants of it.    For the next hour or two (and mind you, it was very late by this point) I went through my song books looking for a song to sing.  Keeping in mind the passage that Pastor Tony would be preaching on (1Timothy 4:12-16), I eventually decided on the song "These Things are True of You" by Tommy Walker.  I went to bed past 2, but could hardly sleep a wink.  I was alternatively tossing, turning, and praying.  Why the heck was I so nervous? I always get like this about having to get up in front of people and do anything.  The funny thing is that I am perfectly comfortable in front of the classroom, teaching.  Just goes to show that I am more meant to be a teacher than a singer. ^^  Anyway, I ended up getting up at 5:45.  I couldn't sleep anymore. After eating breakfast and getting ready, I went to my office, typed out and printed the song, sang it a few times, prayed, read the Word, and then went to meet my accompanist at 7:30.  We practiced a few times before he had to go to his praise team practice, and then practiced a couple more times just before service started at 9.  The practices actually went beautifully, but (this always happens to me) I got nervous again when I actually got up in front of everyone, and just did a mediocre job, in my opinion.  But God knows what He is doing, because by the end of the first couple of lines, I was like "hang it all, I'm just going to worship God because this isn't going my way."  Worshipping Him should have been my first heart-set anyway, right? Well, yeah, but I am a fallen, sinful creature and God has to remind me of that sometimes. ^^ He did that today.  And so, even though the singing didn't go as well as I would have liked, many people afterwards said they loved the  song , that they were blessed by it.  To me, that's a good thing, because they weren't focused on my voice, they were drawn to the message of the song (good lyrics by the way!).  Here is the song:   Unshakable, immovable, faithful and true,  Full of wisdom, strength and beauty These things are true of You.    Fearless, courageous, righteousness shines through In all You do, yet You're so humble, You laid down Your life.   These things are true of You.  	And as I turn my face to You, O Lord, I ask and pray 	By the power of Your love and grace 	Make these things true of me too. 	Make these things true of me too.  Patient, compassionate, love flows through you.   You never give up on the hopeless ones. These things are true of you.   Holy and blameless, You stand up for justice and truth, yet You love mercy and forgiveness.   These things are true of You.   I think that the people who did say that I sang well were just being nice. :b But still, I don't regret doing it, because I believe it brought glory to God. Now I am totally exhausted though, so I'm just going to head on home and take a  long  afternoon nap....

      Can I share this letter with you guys? It's from one of my freshmen day students, originally in the form of a cute e-card....it's moments like this that I realize what a special job teaching is....   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hi, Sandra~^^* I'm Hye-Jung in your class. Today we had last class in this semester. I'm put to inconvenience that. I think this semester and this year was so short to me. How time flies!  In school time as a University student student, I thank God to meet good friends, seniors, and  professors. Especially, It's thankful and happy to meet you.  Of course, one semester is very short to know  each other well. But you whom I see through this semester are very warm, pretty and  positive people. When I'm with you, I could feel pleasure and thanks.  You teached me something more than knowledge. -thanksgiving, bright thinking and so on...^^ You are a special to me an all of us. I will remeber you as a good professor, friendly sister, and warm people. ^^  Today I was so happy to have a time  with you and some classmates. It's a precious time to me.  Have a nice weekend and rest time of this semester. And keep your hearth.  I love you in Jesus Christ*^.^*  warmly Jane  --------------------------------------------  After class, Hye Jung and three other girls in the class brought lunch to my office!  I was incredibly touched...I mean, what are they doing buying me lunch? They are poor students!  After eating lunch in my office, I took them to the cafe and we sat around drinking milk tea and eating ice cream.  We had a good time talking, and we took lots of pictures.  :( I am so sad. A lot of the other students wrote the sweetest things on our intranet bulletin board, so much so that I actually teared up....I am really going to miss this class.  Sure, I'll see them around next semester, but it's just not the same as having them in my classroom and seeing them regularly.    They liked the song a lot.  I didn't know this at the time, but when I was explaining why the song was so meaningful to me, one of the male students said that he actually cried....^^!    By the way, if anyone is interested, I think that the version by the group "By the Tree" is the best.

      My last frosh day class is tomorrow morning, 10 am.  I have goodies and fruit ready for them, as well as a song that I am going to teach them.  It's kind of old, called "Your Beloved".  If you want to know why this song has special significance to me, especially in light of being at Handong, please read the following archive:   urlLink http://sandita.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_sandita_archive.html   I think it is the perfect way to end my first semester at Handong.    Here are the lyrics:   Lord it was You who Created the heavens Lord it was Your hand That put the stars in their place  Lord it is Your voice That commands the morning Even oceans and their waves             Bow at Your feet Lord who am I Compared to Your glory, Oh Lord  Lord who am I Compared to Your majesty I am Your beloved Your creation And You love me as I am                      You have called me chosen for Your kingdom     Unashamed to call me Your own              I am Your beloved    I guess it's not _totally_ the end tomorrow...this day class and I are planning on hanging out the evening of the last day of finals.  They're so cute...they want to take me out downtown! ^;^  shout out to Allen: Thanks for calling me dude.  You made my day. ^^

      Last day of classes today.  I was sad.  I really really enjoyed my spanish course.  It's my dream to teach like my spanish teacher.  Off to Barcelona on Sunday! Hope the weather is good, because it is really cold right now in Madrid.  Ok, I'm bored. It's 10 pm here, Friday evening, and I missed an appointment with a friend.  It's complicated, but it all basically comes down to not having a cell phone...gr. ^^ I had nothing else to do, so that's why I am here at an internet cafe, chatting on aol with my bro John and writing gibberish on my blog. :) Pathetic! My last Friday night in Madrid, and all by my lonesome self.  At least tomorrow night I'll be meeting up with my Spanish friends!  Miss you all.

      Just want to share a couple of things that I've read recently that have absolutely amazed me with their insights into the beautiful connection between human knowledge, and Truth.    "Nearly all the wisdom we possess, that is to say, true and sound wisdom, consists of two parts:  the knowledge of God and of ourselves.  But, while joined by many bonds, which one precedes and brings forth the other is not easy to discern.  In the first place, no one can look upon himself without immediately turning his thoughts to the contemplation of God, in whom he lives and moves...Again, it is certain that man never achieves a clear knowledge of  himself unless he has first looked upon God's face, and then descends from contemplating Him to scrutinize himself." (John Calvin)  "Believers themselves have not chosen the Christian position because they are wiser than others.  What they have they have by grace alone.  But this does not mean that they accept the problematics of fallen man as right...Fallen man does  in principle  seek to be a law unto himself.  But he cannot carry out his own principle to its full degree.   He is restrained from doing so...In spite of what he does against God, he can and  must  work for God; thus he is able to make a "positive contribution" to human culture."  (Cornelus Van Til)   And lastly, a poem by Emily Dickinson (whom I just recently rediscovered when I bought a book that translates her poems into Spanish...she is now one of my all time favorite poets):   All Circumstances are the Frame In which His Face is set-- All Latitudes exist for His Sufficient Continent--  The Light His Action, and the Dark The Leisure of His Will-- In Him Existence serve or set A Force illegible.   Do you see how amazingly they all connect? It's just incredible how God works all things together for His glory, and that every pursuit of knowledge going on around the globe at this moment brings Him glory whenever it touches upon Truth, as of course it will at some point, since all truth is God's truth.  That's also why I love poetry so much, because whether a poet is saved or not, if he/she writes from a deeply honest place, he/she will reveal some level of Truth about the spiritual or the human.  And that's always the starting point for the gospel.  I have more to write about that, but maybe some other time.  Anyway, I want to thank those of you who have been praying for me.  God has really been redirecting and renewing me.  I am realizing that being a prof of lit will not only allow me to bring the light of Christ into the classroom, but also into the world of academia.  I want to shine the light of Christ in my scholarship, too.  Too much of God's Truth has been twisted and corrupted.  I would like to go in there with a clearer vision of things and shed light on the realities of humanity in and through literature across cultures, across languages.  Comp Lit is better for me than Eng Lit in this sense because it makes more room for universals to be evident.  Case in point, I was surfing the web for Comp Lit programs, when I came across a new e-journal called  Perspectives on Evil and Human Wickedness .  It was listed under the resources for the American Comparative Literature Association homepage!  I went to the website, and here is what is said:   The Wickedness.Net project seeks to explore all issues relating to evil and human wickedness. In particular, it has two main aims;   1. to provide a comprehensive forum which is committed to promoting inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary explorations of, and perspectives on evil and wickedness.  2. to make available to scholars, researchers, and any one interested a set of research tools that bring together a wide variety of materials and resources which relate to this subject.   The project is deliberately and distinctively inter- and multi-disciplinary in nature; the hope is that this will help generate provocative insights into evil from across the spectrum of academic fields, professions, vocations, religious traditions and other relevant sources. By bringing together perspectives and views from the various disciplines, professions, and vocations the emphasis is on creativity and innovation in wrestling with the problems raised by evil and human wickedness.   Amazing, isn't it?  This is the kind of stuff I want to study and research and teach via literature.  I am not sure if this is making much sense to you, because it is only vaguely inseminating in me, but I am not saying that I am going to preach about Christ in literary articles. No way.  That would never fly, because I'd have no credibility.  But I want to write and teach in way that resonates with Truth, that gives others a glimpse into the beauty of a worldview that clarifies and illuminates, not obscures.....and I want to share the gospel through relationships that form within those academic environments.

      Last week was up and down. I met Joyce's friends, a married couple living here in Madrid, and it was really rejuvenating to have quality conversation with Christians in English.  Thanks for getting me in touch with them Joyce!  I got pretty sick after that, because they had cats and I'm horribly allergic to cats.  My theory is that the cat hair got into my body, weakened my immune system, and made me susceptible to catching the flu (I think it's the flu?).  So now I have the flu, and am still getting over it.  I even had to skip out of class early on Friday, which I really didn't like doing since we were in the middle of the fantastic world of subjunctives.  It's not too great being sick when you are overseas and without any family around.  I also met up with Cova, her boyfriend, and her brother.  We ate at a traditional Spanish restaurant in the Chueca barrio....delicious. But what I enjoyed more was observing Cova interact with her brother.  Can't explain it, but it was special.  In Spain, the children in our generation usually have huge families. Like Jaime, he has 4 siblings. But for Cova, it's just her and her brother, and they are super close.  I was flattered that her brother even wanted to meet me, just because I am her friend!  And I went to Jaime's home again for another long meal and siesta with his family.  It was eleven people this time-- me, Jaime, his parents, his siblings, the American exchange student who is staying at their home, and two cousins.  My head was spinning with all the Spanish that goes on simultaneously when so many Spanish people are together (and on top of that I was out of it due to the effects of flu medicine), but the food was incredible.  When most of the people had gone, and all that were left were me, Jaime, his mom, his dad, and his brother, we had a good conversation.  I won't forget it.    I accomplished a lot of sightseeing last week too.  I think that I've been to all the touristy must-sees.  This last week in Madrid I'll just be revisiting the places I liked the best. Then I am off to Barcelona for one week, then back to Korea!

      This is a reposting of a poem I wrote in Korea this past semester, only because it is exactly how I feel right now here in Madrid.   A foreigner   stands  outside looking in to something strange to the eye language unreaching culture unamniotic yet familiar to humanness  as spirits brush each other not getting in  but staying out is centered in  more ways some way alone looking inside hears thoughts sees sin calls the world truth right there and in the echoing vastness as the universe suddenly enlarges eyes opened illumination pursues the one thing carving out a chasm of loneliness that sharpens, emboldens present living weaved into the eternal unseen Word Thought Expressed Language Foreign And Universal Reaching  Down

      A few things happened this past weekend that have depressed my mood.  Cova's grandmother passed away last Thursday...I hung out with Jaime and all his friends on Friday night until the wee hours of the morning, and witnessed a lot of hedonistic darkness.....and other things happened yesterday in my day trip to Segovia that I don't really want to talk about here.....   Please keep praying for me. While I am learning a lot, having a good time, and building relationships, being a lone Christian in a foreign place is really hard at times.  And the language barrier gets frustrating, because I find that I can't talk deeply with anyone about anything.  It gets as far as,"Yeah, I go to church" or, "Yeah, I'm a christian" but no more.  However it does make me determined to really learn the language.  Sometimes in my room, I make speeches to myself in Spanish about what I believe, why I believe what I believe, etc.  I have yet to put these speeches to use though....I think a part of it is that even if I am ready to speak about my faith in Spanish, the Spanish people I speak with would never guess that I could, so our conversations are always cut short.....I think....but I also know that a big part of it is that I am a chicken, and if the other person doesn't initiate, or if it doesn't flow with the conversation, I won't broach or pursue the topic.....  I am reading a book by Greg Bahnsen called "Always Ready".  The chapter I read last night was about having humble boldness with the gospel.  It makes sense.  At the same time that the absolute perfection of the Rock of Truth humbles the sinful, weak believer, it simultaneously emboldens her to speak the truth because it is so immutably, infallibly  true .  I felt like it was a direct rebuke to me.....    Lord, help me to live the words of Colossions 4:5-6.  Help me to spend my time here to the fullest, "redeeming the time", that my words and actions would be "full of grace and seasoned with salt", and that I would always "be ready with an answer for the hope that I have".  But Lord, I also pray that you would help to trust in Your timing, knowing that it is not I who is the accomplisher--You are.  If it is not Your will that I share the gospel verbally in my last two weeks in Madrid, at least give me the strength and inspiration, by Your stunning grace, to live it out shiningly and uncompromisingly, and to be a persevering prayer warrior for the lost....

      I'm back.  I should really be spending my time visiting museums and such, but I've reasoned with myself that it's ok to finish updating my blog today, and spending the rest of this week sightseeing. Anyway.  Last Sunday I found a korean church in Madrid!  I know, I know, why go to a korean church while in Spain?  But I saw it in the yellow pages, and I was really curious as to what it would be like.  I'm glad I went....it was very interesting.  It's a very young church, so everything was conducted in korean.  Before the service began, they were practicing a korean praise song that I had learned this past semester at Handong!  It brought tears to my eyes because it was a glimpse at the Body of Christ in the world, united in even little ways.  Despite the fact that everything was in korean though, I was thrilled to hear beautiful, fluent spanish coming out of the mouths of the korean-spanish youth!   They have yet to establish a spanish ministry for them though.    The samonim noticed me right away, and invited me to her home for lunch after service.  We ate kimchi jjeeh-geh, a welcome relief to my growing craving for korean food after only one week in Madrid. ^^  It was also really nice to hear and speak in korean again. Felt like home.  I talked with the samonim's daughter, who is in her last year of high school, and I think that I might have convinced her to apply to Handong for college! She and her mother had heard good things about the school, but she didn't even think about applying there before our conversation.     Their family is quite interesting...the parents were missionaries to the nationals in the Canary Islands as well as Germany.  They have only recently settled in Madrid in the last four years  to establish a church for the Korean-speaking community here.  So their children speak spanish, german, korean, as well as some english.  German is her best language, but I was talking with her in a mixture of spanish, korean, and english.  It was wild.  She was lamenting the fact that she was not perfectly fluent in any of the languages, but I encouraged her that it was understandable since she's learning them all at the same time.  If she keeps it up, I believe that in 10 years time she'll be fully quadralingual.  Anyway, I was again impressed by the fact that it can be a good thing to raise children overseas.  She had this maturity about her that was beyond her years.  Even though our conversation was short, it was clear to me that she knew what was important in life just by the things she talked about. She wasn't into the superficial, material things that most kids her age are into. The visit reminded me of Paris, when I met two missionary families who were trying to reach the Muslim community there.  One of the kids, a little girl about the age of 5, also struck me with her maturity.  This little girl is equally fluent in both English and French, since her parents are American and she attends a french school.  When we left, you should have seen how difficult it was for her to part with a female member of a missionary team that had been with them for a month.  She cried and cried as if the world was going to end, and verbally articulated her emotions too.  She told the girl how she felt and communicated how special their time was together, short as it was ("I'll remember the times we colored together!").  Her parents explained that it's because she's been around enough to know that people are unique and special, and that goodbyes are special too, because you might not ever see that person again.  That's at the age of five! I guess you could see that as negative, but if nurtured in a proper manner, such a child can grow up to have very broad perspectives and a deep, holistic intellect.  These missionaries were excellent parents.  I was with them an entire day, and it was really awesome to see how the family interacted.    But back to Spain.  In the week and a half I've been here, I've been seriously considering switching from the english lit track to the comparative lit track.  This isn't as sudden as it sounds.  The last time I was seriously considering comp lit was while I was in Paris this summer.  It seems that whenever I travel and see more of the world, it's clear that Eng lit is very narrow as a field because it is too localized.  But I let go of the idea because I didn't think I was good enough at any non-native languages, but after being in korea for five months and only a week and a half here, it might be possible.  In order to apply for comp lit programs, I need to be proficient at two non-native languages, and it is beginning to look as if those two could be korean and spanish if I continue to work diligently on them.  I also need a read-only language, which could be french.....  But why comp lit? Well, it just seems to fit a lot better with who I am.  It would allow me to study not only literature, but language and culture as well.  In addition, my time in Korea as well as my time in Paris and Spain would be quite "on track,"  whereas this period in my life overseas is pretty much off the English lit track.  Moreover my major in Human Biology would actually lend itself to studying comp lit, since my area of concentration was anthropological.  I'm not sure what I'd say about Hum Bio if I were to be applying to English lit programs.  Plus, a career including traveling and being overseas would be encouraged in a field like comp lit, whereas it would be highly discouraged in english lit (except for hopping over to England, of course).  I would have to hide that aspect of my goals if I were to apply to English lit programs. One other great thing about switching is that I'd be permitted to apply to the comp lit program at Stanford, whereas the English grad program would never ever admit someone who was an english major as a Stanford undergrad (it's considered "academic inbreeding").    Plus, I don't love English literature because it is in ENGLISH.  I just love the art of literature, and I know that I would love it even more if I could study it without being limited to one language or to anglo-phone locales.    It all makes sense, right? The only problem is...I don't know if I am at all qualified.  I took zero comp lit classes or college level language courses when I was at Stanford, and I don't know if that's ok.  It is an interdisciplinary field, though, so there is a chance that if what I've done over the course of the past five years is relevant, I'm good to go.  We'll see.  I've gotta do some research, but I can't really do that until I am back in Korea.....  That's all for now.  Lots of other things going on in my head, which is the nice thing about being here alone.  I've had some good quality time just journalling, writing poetry again, and reflecting.  Thanks for your prayers.

      I'm at an internet cafe in Madrid, and I feel a little overwhelmed because there is so much to write about and so little time.  It's pretty cheap to get online  though...it's only costing me one euro per hour.  Ok, so I am going to be as organized and as concise as possible.  Here are my topics for today's entry:  school homestay friends korean church--missionary kid comp lit    A lot, right? But I know you miss me and that you are dying to hear all the details!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^^  SCHOOL It's great.  I'm attending International House, Madrid, and I'm glad Joyce told me about it because it really is an awesome language school.  The teachers are excellent! I am learning a lot, and rapidly.  I'm also taking down a lot of observation notes on the different teaching techniques mi profesora uses.  Carmen's truly amazing.  I love going to class everyday if only to learn more about how to be a better language teacher.  But of course the beauty of it is that, because she's such a great teacher, I myself am progressing in espanol!  HOMESTAY I live with a little old lady, whom I endearingly refer to as "mi abuelita."  She is very small, and very cute! She loves to talk, so I do lot of listening when I am with her.^^ The nice thing about my homestay is that I have a lot of privacy. My room is nicely furnished, pretty spacious, and always clean.  She cleans it everyday, and even handwashes my laundry! I am going to give her a nice gift when I leave.    FRIENDS I have been hanging out with my Spanish friends from Paris.  I went to Ruben's house last Thursday, and saw him as well as Jaime and Nacho, and I met several of their friends.  Jaime also invited me to his home on Saturday, and his mother cooked up quite an amazing meal! I was absolutely stuffed, but fully content.  Lunch is at an odd hour in Spain....we ate at 4 pm!  I arrived there around 2, and left around 8, so I spent my entire Saturday afternoon "siesta" with Jaime's huge family. He has two sisters, Paloma and Ana, and two brothers, Andres and Eduardo.  Meeting them and spending time with them was really really special.  We just sat around and ate and talked and watched TV and ate again and talked some more.  His mother really took a liking to me. She kept saying, "Ella es muy inteligente y interesante," (I'm not sure what made her think that, but it's fine with me!^^)  and asked me a bunch of questions about Korea as well as my life as a Korean American.  Before I left, she declared, "Te veremos." ("We _will_ see you (again)").  I got to see all of Jaime's pictures as well as all the family pictures around the house.  I can't believe how goodlooking Spanish people are.  Both Jaime's parents were hotties when they were young, and all his siblings are gorgeous.  And Jaime's girlfriend, Almodena, seriously looks like she stepped out of the cover of Vogue magazine! Oh, and Jaime isn't so badlooking himself.  Also, Jaime is an artist, so he showed me several of his paintings as well as a couple of art books he's been published in.  I am not often easily impressed by people, but Jaime really impressed me with his talent. His paintings are Mondrianesque, except that he likes to utilize the space around a painting as well, and sometimes paints on the walls around the paintings.  In that sense his work reminded me of Daniel Buren.    After we left his home, we went and met Cova, my other friend from Paris, and her boyfriend Luis.  They were in the middle of studying for finals, so we only chatted for about an hour and looked at pics.  Then we went out and met a bunch of Jaime's friends, going from bar to bar.  I hope we go dancing next time.  Bars aren't very  fun because I don't like to drink very much, and Spanish is especially hard to understand in such a loud setting.  But it was nice to see a bit of Jaime's life in Madrid.  I have yet to meet his girlfriend in person, because she's been sick.  I will probably meet her this week, although I am a bit intimidated by her drop-dead gorgeousness!  This week, I am supposed to have lunch with Cova and Luis, and go sometime to Jaime's university to see his studio and watch him paint.   Please keep praying that God would give me the opportunity to share about my faith with Cova and Jaime.  I've been meeting people from different parts of the world in my language school, so that's been neat, too.  OK, I am really running out of time now, but I guess I will come back tomorrow and finish up my thoughts.

      Prayer requests for my trip to Spain: 1) That I get there and back safely, without any complications.  Protection from pickpockets! 2) That I am the light of Christ to whomever I meet there. 3) That I am diligent in studying Spanish, making the most of my time and money. 4) That God broadens me, stretches me as I encounter a different culture and see places I've never seen before. 5) That God "enlarges my heart to run after [His] commandments" and opens my eyes to see more of His hand in the world.  6) That God would use the time alone to help me reflect on my life and renew my vision.

      Happy New Year! It is January 1, 2003 everyone!  Only 4 more days before I am off to Europe again.  Janice called me "cosmo girl" the other day.  Maybe I am, but I don't really think of myself in that way.  I just want to see the world and be in the world, and I want to get "good at" going from country to country.  There's been a recent drive in me to learn languages, and I think a part of that drive is a desire to adapt in as many places as I can, as well as I can.   So I am simultaneously working on my French, Spanish , and Korean.  A friend also told me yesterday that Japanese is very similar in structure to Korean, so perhaps I can take up Japanese someday too.  And if I brush up on my Latin from high school, that might open doors to learn other Latinate languages too, if I ever need to.  Who knows where God might call me, and it's important to me to be working on learning languages consistently.  It's not so much that I want to be heptalingual or anything...I honestly don't think I will ever be totally fluent in any of these languages, except maybe Korean.  However the  process  of learning another language reminds me of the world out there, and that perspective is very important to me.  Learning languages helps reveal to me the glory of who God is.  Language is beautiful, because it is a part of God's image.  He chose to create using words-- "Let there be light, and it was so...", He chose to communicate with us through the Holy Word.  And of course, Jesus himself is "The Word".  The many languages of the world give me a glimpse into God's infinite nature and kaleidoscopic beauty....   But why travel so much? This goes back to something I wanted to write a long time ago in relation to missions, something God showed me when I was in Europe this past summer.  While I was in Paris, I was struggling with the question, "Why do I keep traveling instead of going on mission trips?"  I haven't been on a mission trip since high school, and the one I did go on in high school was a short 9 day trip to Mexico, just south of the border.  I could hardly call it a mission trip....it was more like an outreach excursion.    But when I was in Paris, I met people from many different parts of the world....Germany, Japan, Korea, Africa, Sweden, France, Italy, Mexico, Spain, etc.  I especially got along with my friends from Spain....we had a blast in Paris together. Interestingly, I hung out so much with them and all their Spanish friends that my ears actually opened to Spanish again by the end of my stay, even though I hadn't touched Spanish since high school.  What I mean by that is, though I still couldn't really communicate myself in Spanish, I could understand nearly all of what they were saying.  I couldn't even understand that much when I was in high school!  My friend Jaime and I had brunch together in our last week in Paris, and this is how we communicated-- he spoke in Spanish while I spoke in English.  And our communication was actually very effective like that, because both our listening skills are much better than our speaking skills in our foreign languages.  Haha, we sure got stared at a lot. ^^  So it was only in that last week that we could even start talking about substantive topics, since before that point, we had been trying to communicate in our broken, baby French.  Anyways, it was my Spanish friends' idea that I come to Spain and visit them and study Spanish.  They got really excited when they saw me growing in my comprehension skills, and we got closer because of it.    The thing is, I had been planning on finally going on a mission trip this winter, so I struggled with what to do.  But after a lot of prayer, God showed me that the two-- traveling vs. missions -- didn't have to be mutually exclusive.  Missions is a lot about forming relationships with nonbelievers and showing them the gospel in word and in deed, and God showed me that missions doesn't have to be performed in discrete segments that have a beginning and an ending (ie, short term mission trips), but can be fluid and just a part of your life.  I started relationships with my Spanish friends, and I can continue them, and this trip might be my chance to share about my faith with them.  Or at least be the light of Christ in their Christ-less world.  And God showed me that this is how my life will be as a long term missions-minded person....people will come into my life who need Christ, and my part is just to love them, to pray for them, and to show them the gospel.  For all I know, I might be the only one praying for my friends Jaime and Cova...  If tentmaking missions is going to be my life, then I need to learn how to saturate every part of my life with the gospel.  That includes my interests, whether it be traveling, or literature, or singing/dancing, or friendships, or my job, or family, etc.   So I think it is a blessing that I get to see Jaime and Cova again, improve my Spanish, and enjoy some traveling.  All these things can bring glory to God, and all these things can be a part of the missions work.  Of course, if I am not focused upon Christ, then all these things can become idols in themselves.  Please pray that that does not happen.  Please pray that my trip to Spain is totally and completely God-centered.  And this all goes back to my 12/22 entry.  You can see how God is teaching me the same lesson over and over again, because it's taking me forever to actually get it.  To actually trust Him with my whole being.  To love Him first and foremost-- heart, soul, and mind.  To let Him lead me whenever He appoints the time, doing whatever He wants me to do, being whoever He wants me to be.    One thing that keeps resurfacing for me is this: God does not fit into the prescribed parameters we often set for Him.  We are inadequate judges for how He is "supposed" to work in the world.  He is more imaginative and creative than we could ever dream of, because that's part of His Holy beauty.  Isn't it wonderful when He takes the quotidian and does the spectacular? That's the gospel, isn't it? That's what Jesus did.   So it makes sense to me that that magnificent creativity, that unexpected reversal of pattern, that turning of water into wine, would translate into the lives of His people too.  And off I am to Spain, an ordinary person doing an ordinary thing, but set apart because of Christ in me.                                                                            "TO LIVE IS CHRIST"

      Spending time with God this morning, I was deeply moved by the following passage in I John 3:  "This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence whenever our hearts condemn us. For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.  Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him."   And I sang this song over and over again, because I wanted to mean it.   All that I am, all that I have I lay them down before you, O Lord All my regrets, all my acclaims The joy and the pain, I'm making them Yours  Lord, I offer my life to You Everything I've been through Use it for your Glory Lord I offer my days to You Lifting my praise to You as a pleasing sacrifice Lord I offer you my life  Things in the past, things yet unseen Wishes and dreams that are yet to come true All of my hopes, all of my plans My heart and my hands are lifted to you

      I took the personality test JoMo mentioned on his blog, the MBTI test.   I was shocked by the results. I am an  INFJ personality (Introverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, Judging).  At first, when I read that, I was like, what the? Everyone always thinks of me as an extrovert, although I've always noticed my own need for introversion.  But the results were actually:  slightly introverted moderately intuitive moderately feeling slightly judging  Basically, in all 4 categories, I span the dichotomy, and only slightly or moderately fall more to one side. I guess I should mention what those categories are:  Introverted vs. Extroverted Sensing vs. Intuitive Thinking vs. Feeling Judging vs. Perceiving  For more description see  urlLink here .  Anyway, I am apparently an unusual "type".  Here is a description that I found about INFJ's, and it was absolutely fascinating to me.   "Introverted iNtuiting Feeling Judging by Marina Margaret Heiss  INFJs are distinguished by both their complexity of character and the unusual range and depth of their talents. Strongly humanitarian in outlook, INFJs tend to be idealists, and because of their J preference for closure and completion, they are generally "doers" as well as dreamers. This rare combination of vision and practicality often results in INFJs taking a disproportionate amount of responsibility in the various causes to which so many of them seem to be drawn.   INFJs are deeply concerned about their relations with individuals as well as the state of humanity at large. They are, in fact, sometimes mistaken for extroverts because they appear so outgoing and are so genuinely interested in people -- a product of the Feeling function they most readily show to the world. On the contrary, INFJs are true introverts, who can only be emotionally intimate and fulfilled with a chosen few from among their long-term friends, family, or obvious "soul mates." While instinctively courting the personal and organizational demands continually made upon them by others, at intervals INFJs will suddenly withdraw into themselves, sometimes shutting out even their intimates. This apparent paradox is a necessary escape valve for them, providing both time to rebuild their depleted resources and a filter to prevent the emotional overload to which they are so susceptible as inherent "givers." As a pattern of behavior, it is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the enigmatic INFJ character to outsiders, and hence the most often misunderstood -- particularly by those who have little experience with this rare type.   Due in part to the unique perspective produced by this alternation between detachment and involvement in the lives of the people around them, INFJs may well have the clearest insights of all the types into the motivations of others, for good and for evil. The most important contributing factor to this uncanny gift, however, are the empathic abilities often found in Fs, which seem to be especially heightened in the INFJ type (possibly by the dominance of the introverted N function).   This empathy can serve as a classic example of the two-edged nature of certain INFJ talents, as it can be strong enough to cause discomfort or pain in negative or stressful situations. More explicit inner conflicts are also not uncommon in INFJs; it is possible to speculate that the causes for some of these may lie in the specific combinations of preferences which define this complex type. For instance, there can sometimes be a "tug-of-war" between NF vision and idealism and the J practicality that urges compromise for the sake of achieving the highest priority goals. And the I and J combination, while perhaps enhancing self-awareness, may make it difficult for INFJs to articulate their deepest and most convoluted feelings.   Usually self-expression comes more easily to INFJs on paper, as they tend to have strong writing skills. Since in addition they often possess a strong personal charisma, INFJs are generally well-suited to the "inspirational" professions such as teaching (especially in higher education) and religious leadership. Psychology and counseling are other obvious choices, but overall, INFJs can be exceptionally difficult to pigeonhole by their career paths. Perhaps the best example of this occurs in the technical fields. Many INFJs perceive themselves at a disadvantage when dealing with the mystique and formality of "hard logic", and in academic terms this may cause a tendency to gravitate towards the liberal arts rather than the sciences. However, the significant minority of INFJs who do pursue studies and careers in the latter areas tend to be as successful as their T counterparts, as it is *iNtuition* -- the dominant function for the INFJ type -- which governs the ability to understand abstract theory and implement it creatively.   In their own way, INFJs are just as much "systems builders" as are INTJs; the difference lies in that most INFJ "systems" are founded on human beings and human values, rather than information and technology. Their systems may for these reasons be conceptually "blurrier" than analogous NT ones, harder to measure in strict numerical terms, and easier to take for granted -- yet it is these same underlying reasons which make the resulting contributions to society so vital and profound."  It's kind of a grandiose description, and too flattering to describe me perfectly, but there is a _lot_ of it that describes me to the t. Those of you who know me really well might see it.

      I just added a link to some of the poems I've written since coming to Korea (well most of them-- one of them was written in France last summer). You will recognize some of them since I've posted them before on this site.  Others I've posted for the first time.  They are not in chronological order, because I couldn't remember when I wrote what.   From now on, if I ever post a poem, it will be to that site (www.soheespoems.blogspot.com), not this one.  I can't believe I am doing this, but honestly, for some reason I feel like I am being brave.

      Unexpectedly, I have had some time to relax and rest here in Seoul, because my cousins couldn't meet me until later this afternoon (it's Saturday morning right now). I'll be going to Chung Ju around 4pm, and then back to Pohang on the overnight bus Sunday evening.  So what did I do all Thursday and Friday? I just hung out with my aunt. I helped her make kakddoogeeh kimchi and other banchans. I loooooove my aunt.  I also did some reading, played guitar, refurbished my blog.    Last night I hung out with my buddy Yohan in Deh-hak-no, at this awesome live jazz bar called Chunnyun Dongando. We saw two groups perform, and it was the wildest thing for me to see Koreans playing music from the whole of the American jazz tradition.  Between the two groups, they played everything from "Cheek to Cheek" to "I Feel Good" to a reggae version of "Swing Low Sweet Chariot."  They played fusion jazz, swing, bebop, new orleans, everything. And they were gooood.  Of course, all the songs they did were American.  Last night it really hit home how American jazz music is....I mean, it originated soley in the United States with the Black American heritage, and sitting in that bar last night I felt proud to be an American. I smiled to myself as I just wrote that line, because I am rarely one to feel patriotic, but last night I guess I did.  The thing is, jazz is such a rich tradition because of the historical and cultural contexts in which it was wrought.  If you've read Ellison's  Invisible Man  (absolutely highly recommended book for any American), you know that jazz is more than just a few catchy tunes.  It really embodies a history of racial conflict and the voice of a powerful, passionate subculture. When I looked around me, I knew that most of the Koreans in that room had no idea about the origin and meaning and evolution of jazz music.  They were just enjoying good music.  It made me sad and proud at the same time. It made me sad that they couldn't fully appreciate the depth of the aural art that jazz is, and yet proud that despite that, it is still impacting audiences around the world.  I mean, in Korea of all places! Yohan told me that there is even a famous jazz music school across the street from the jazz club. He plays the drums, and would like to study there someday.   I saw another interesting thing though...what the music actually  did  to these Korean musicians. There was this female singer for instance. When she wasn't singing, and just speaking to the audience, she was the typical shy, demure, yamjunhan korean woman. I mean, you could hardly hear what she was saying, she spoke so softly.  But when she started singing! She got  down .  I wasn't even the one who noticed it; Yohan pointed it out to me first.  But his comment made me start noticing the other musicians, and it was the same thing.  For the most part, they all seemed sort of stiff and formal, but when the music started, you could actually  see  them getting lost in the synergy of improvisation, the catharsis of dynamic expression.  I'm telling you, jazz is powerful down to the subconscious level.   It's been a good time. Chung Ju won't be as relaxing though, because my cousin's children are super hyper, and they often wear me out.  I mean, I adore them, but I need to prepare myself mentally. haha  I really want to write my thoughts on being an American overseas at this time in world history, but my notes are in my other journal in Pohang. I'll have to wait on that. That's going to be a really long entry, because you will hear for the first time what my political views are, and where I stand in terms of being for or against war. Exciting, eh? haha.  I don't usually talk about my political views, because they aren't typically American Conservative Christian (uh...republican?), and I usually get slammed.   Like the time I voted for Gore, and the entire youth group staff was shocked.  I remember, Darren and I were the only ones who thought of voting for Gore, although in the end I think he ended up voting for Bush too. Hmmm, now that I have set up a comments system, I am wondering if people will still respond negatively to my political beliefs.....the only thing I can say is that I do try my best to let the Word guide me, rather than men.  Oh, but in case you are wondering, I do not consider myself a Democrat either.  Independent, I guess.  I mention all that only because the following are notes for myself, to be added to my notes in the other journal, so that I don't forget. Disregard the gibberish....it's just for myself: (paul scotchmer just war theory notes in retreat book what eemo said about sk and nk han, jeong daegoo appa, john's blog)

      I've been so busy moving in, hanging out with my new roommate, getting settled, etc. that I haven't had the chance to really do email or blog. To those of you who have emailed recently, thank you! I miss you!  I'll  try  to get back to you next week, because this week is crazy busy. I'm leaving for a faculty retreat soon, and I'll be at the Kyung Ju Hilton (woohoo!) until Thursday, and then I am going to try to get a flight out to Seoul that night because I have to pick up the rest of my luggage and visit a couple of my relatives before Monday. And then all next week I have a whole slew of meetings in addition to preparing my syllabi and classes before school begins on March 3.  So even though you don't hear from me in awhile, please know that I am thinking of you and praying for you.  But I will try to get back to you next week.

      I'm back in Seoul, and happy to be here. It's unbelievable how much I missed my aunt and her cooking.  When she opened the door, I just wanted to kiss her all over her face, but of course I didn't. ^^ She would've freaked out. hehe But boy, was it gooooooood to eat kimchi again!!!!!  My last week in Spain was wonderful. I had a beautiful time in Barcelona, and when I got back, I spent a lot of time with Jaime and his family, and I met up with Cova and all her friends the night before I left. My last morning was really nice. I had breakfast at Jaime's, and his mother gave me a big hug, made me promise to come back to their home, and Jaime's father took me to the airport and made sure I got to the right gate and everything.    Leaving was strange.  At the same time that I was really anxious and excited about getting back to Korea, I was also very sad to leave Madrid. I realized that in the five weeks that I was in Spain, God taught me a lot in my solitude and in my relationships with my friends there.  It was like a really long, extended retreat of sorts. And while I can't say it was "fun" (I mean, it was really great, don't get me wrong, but that is just _not_ the right word), I can definitely say that it was  rich  (_that's_ the perfect word, given to me by janice ahn ^^).  I feel almost like a different person, I don't know. It's weird.  I mean, I am back in Korea, where everything went on just the same without me for five weeks....  while I was alone in an entirely different part of the world, faced with myself.....MYSELF.....   That's the best I can explain it.  But it is really surreal being back. Just got off the phone with Joyce and Joanne, and it feels like I haven't seen or talked to them in ages. And I saw pictures of them and Ro on Joyce's site, and it seems like I haven't seen Ro for even longer....and it's like I have this huge weight on my chest because I feel overwhelmed by all that I have to tell them, when I don't even know exactly what it is I want to tell them.  I think it's more a feeling like I've changed in some significant way, but it's like being mute because I don't have articulated in my mind how or what or when or who or why etc.  I mean, I wrote a lot on this site while I was in Spain, but I am not sure just how much of it my friends read.  So yeah. It's just weird.  But I really missed them. And I can't wait to see them again. ^^  Unexpected news today though. I have to move out of my lovely apartment, the one just upstairs from Joyce and Jo, to one in an entirely different building. My aunt gave me the message today, I talked with a guy on the phone in Handong administration, and there's really nothing I can do about it. :( It's fine, I mean, my building will still be close to jo and jo's.  But the stressful thing is that I have to be back in Pohang on Wednesady to start moving!  Can you believe it? I was expecting to chill out, veg out, all this week, and now instead, I'll be lifting heavy furniture, packing boxes, arranging rooms, etc. And the train ride to Pohang is another 6 hours of traveling.... gggrrrrrrr  But at least Joyce is there, Ro too, and my other friend Sung Jeh oppa. They can help me move! And of course we can catch up and all. ^^  Ok, gotta run now, because I'm chatting online. But I have sooooo much to write about (as usual). This time about things I realized in Spain about being American, and Korean American at that. More later.

       reflecting   I hear a rush of leaves  falling behind  the recesses of my mind  It is the noiseless power of a fierce somnolence that touches an age-old wound an engraven solstice  What is it that purges painfully  out of my internal fountain when I look upon a  swelling landscape of pristine mountain sea and sky?  After the rain, so pure the fragrance of the fresh earth soars into my innermost self metamorphosed  into a beginningless song of saltless tears and blank white pages calling me a lovely name that I have heard only in the unremembered dreams  When I look upon the rolling fluid mountains the boundless mesmer of a sea the silent peace of that expansive, embraceful sky--  It seems that I am out there filling all that unreachable  infinite space with a repeating sorrow that asks: What follows? Or perhaps, Is it that the wind knows not  where it comes from or where it goes that I dance the mysterious in the vaster landscape in myself--  Unbridgeable mist  of the unknown  joy realized in my still home outside the Valley of Baca  Here the  reflecting  reflected moment between a now and not yet self the one now is the same as the one also am known

      OK, thanks to Tommy and Allen for suggesting that I separate the entries.  Don't know why I didn't think about that! But it's still annoying.....is bloggercontrol ever going to get back to me??? Anyway, I wrote the following entry on March 27, and much has happened since then, so I'll have to update you soon on recent developments.  Not now though, because I am really sick with the flu and don't have the energy....  I threw up last night! I canceled all my day classes today, though I am now here in my office prepping to teach my night classes.  I feel terrible. Fever, body ache, nausea.  Write me a shout out and show me some love. :)  Umma, call me!!!!!!

      I was expecting to be much busier this semester, but it hasnt turned out like that.  There were several extracurriculars that I was going to be involved in , but they somehow all fell through.  The swing club I had been envisioning didnt work out because the student I was going to start it with unexpectedly went on leave this semester.  The EM pastor who had asked me last semester to help lead a praise team for the EM Sunday service this semester unexpectedly did not have his contract renewed, and so thats not happening.  And since his wife, Min, really spearheaded our womens ministry last semester, after she left its been hard for Jo and I to get it going again.  Were not having weekly bible studies anymore, and at this point we are just hoping to organize a couple of larger scale conferences or seminars for the semester.   There had also been a chance that I might be teaching a English lit class in the place of a professor on sabbatical, but they found a more qualified PhD to take his position.    All this has left me feeling somewhat aimless. I love Handong, and I would like to be more connected to this community, whether it be through ministry or participating in an extracurricular activity. The dissatisfaction with this state of things has recently begun to creep into my consciousness, and I have been praying that God would provide me some opportunities for involvement.  Already a couple of things have come within purview. The first is a community choir that another professor has started up. Apparently they are going to be singing classical choral pieces, songs from musicals, as well as praise songs. I have already been asked to lead the group in a couple of praise songs with my guitar for next weeks meeting, so I am hoping that this will be one of the activities in which I can invest my time and energy.   The second thing is something that I would like to start with my day classes. Recently the prospect of integrating faith and learning has begun to excite me again. Last Friday I had a free day with my classes since we got a little ahead in the textbook. I took the opportunity to teach them a praise song, and I had them write reflections on it as well as share in small groups. Speaking from a language teachers point of view, it was a dream lesson because it had my students practicing a whole slew of skills speaking, listening, reading, writing, pronunciation, and vocabularyin a beautifully organic way.   Speaking from the point of view of a Christian, it was a wonderful way to bring Christ into the classroom. I got to share with them about how I see my job as more than just teaching English, but as a way to get the gospel out to the nations. Since English is now a language spoken all over the world, I shared with them that one of my personal goals was to help equip them in speaking about their faith in English so that they could have the confidence to go anywhere in the world and effectively be the light of Christ. For the non-Christians, I encouraged them to use the song as a platform in which to discuss their questions about Christianity with their classmates. Though it didnt really happen that way, it got me thinking. The benefits of encouraging discussions with an apologetic bent would be two-fold. It would be good for the Christians in getting them to think about and to express why they believe what they believe; it would be good for the non-Christians in getting them to think about the hard metaphysical questions that standard education often leaves out. And all of this in English!   After some thought, however, I realized that there wasnt enough class time in the semester to get accomplished all that I would like to in terms of building what I am going to call faith language with my freshmen students, who are still at the basic-intermediate level of linguistic expression. And then the idea came to me. When I reflected on what was the most meaningful part of that days lesson, it wasnt even the song. It was the discussion of a verse that I had typed at the bottom of the page, which I felt related to the song. As a class, we picked out the difficult biblical vocabulary, and tried to find their meaning in context. It worked like a charm.   You know in Phil 2:13, where it says For it is God who works in you to will and to do according to His good purpose? Well, when I asked the students what part of speech will was, they all replied the rote answer: noun. Will is usually a noun in modern day usage, but when I told them that it wasnt a noun in this case, they seemed puzzled. Suddenly they were really interested. I asked them to investigate the meaning in context (a skill they had recently learned), and they eventually figured out that it was a verb, the indicators being the parallel usage of do as well as the infinitive marker to. From there, we went on to discuss the meaning of the verse, the message being that God works in us from the inside out, that He is a transformer of hearts, not just actions. We discussed the next three verses too, and it was just awesome.  Anyway, whats the idea that came to me? An optional bible study in English in conjunction with the course. I would love teaching the Word at the nitty gritty micro-level like that, because it satisfies the literary close-reading side of me as well as the theology loving side of me. I think that Ill announce it today and begin circulating sign-ups. I am considering having a separate seekers study for non-Christians, because I noticed that this years freshmen class has a lot more non-Christians than last years. Judging from the written responses to the song, I have at least two in each section, and my 5th period section has 6.thats in contrast to having only one in my one section last semester. I am not sure what the turnout will be, but I can at least try offering both types of studies.   A law professor also approached me recently, wondering if I might like to lead a Reformed bible study for a few undergrads interested in Reformed theology. I got all excited thinking about it, but I dont know these students at all, and I am probably not the most qualified. I think that Ill tell him that Id like to assist, not lead.   Lots to think about, lots to plan for. But you know, this is exactly what Ive been dreaming about doing ever since I went Urbana three winters ago. I am beginning to see what itll be like as a mission-minded professor-- bringing the light of Christ into the university classroom, living the beauty of the gospel through relationships. This is totally what I want to do for the rest of my life, and I can see that Handong is a great stepping stone in that sense.

      Haven't blogged in awhile.  I am just starting to get settled into a pattern this semester, so hopefully I can start updating regularly again.  My flatmate and I might have a wireless connection in our apartment soon.  Technically, we have a wireless connection right now, but the signal strength is so low that it is impossible to stay connected for more than 10 minutes.  Anyway, if we can somehow work it out so that we have a stronger signal, I'll definitely be blogging more.   So much has happened since the last time I blogged though.  Let's see, Allen came to Handong for a few days.  We had a blast just hanging out with my friends and stuff.  He even got to join us for Ro's birthday party, for which we went to Kyung Ju.  We sang in a norebang until 2 in the morning!  They had all the latest songs in English there, so we sang ourselves hoarse.  Joyce has some pics up on her website.  Go check em out...she's linked to this page.    It was so nice having Al here, because it brought my two worlds together, in a way.  He got along fabulously with my friends, which was really touching.  He played volleyball with Ro, had deep talks while running errands with Joyce, and spent a lot of time talking about books and singing with my roomie Jess.  I love it when my friends love each other. ^^  Allen was seriously the easiest guest to host, because he's so chill.  The best part, though, was beating him in a game of basketball. hehe. Ok, he was playing left-handed, but he still thought that he could beat me. DIDN'T THINK SO! HA! I also beat him in a game of Around-the-World.  He beat me in a game of HORSE, but only by one letter. ^^  Good times.   What else? Well, this past Saturday I had a reunion with my ahjummah class from last semester, along with Jess, who is their teacher this semester.  We ate goooooood homemade food.  Anyway, afterwards, Jess somehow convinced me to get my hair done, so I got my hair straightened! I like it a lot...it's just so much easier to manage.  Too bad it took the stylist 6 freakin hours to do my hair! Koreans aren't used to my hair, so he had to do the whole process  twice .  My butt was sore by the seventh hour, but I felt more sorry for the stylist, who was standing the entire time!  He did a good job though.  Afterwards, one of our ahjummahs picked us up, and we went to eat !  It was my first time, and I was proud of myself and Jess for going through with it.  Absolutely delicious. ^^ Still, one time was enough.  I probably won't touch it again for several years.....  Ironically, Jo and Joyce bought a little puppy that very evening!!!!!!! He is sooooooooooooooo adorable!!!!!!!! Moo-moo is a tiny little black-and-white cockerspaniel.  I just fell in love with him.  He's so cute I could just eat him up (figuratively speaking ^^)!!!!!  Joyce has pics of him on her website.  But I don't know if pictures can capture how charming Moo-moo is.  You should see him walk.  He's only fifty days old, so his hind legs are still a little weaker than his front legs.  Yesterday we saw him run around a little though, so he's getting stronger by the minute it seems.  When he walks around underneath the dining table he looks like he's roaming through a forest of chair legs, he's so small. I love him! I tell him that I love him, and he lets me kiss him. ^^ I am going to go see him right now.  Moo-moo here I come!!!!!

      It's been a hectic two weeks, I tell ya.  School started, and it was crazy around here because our department was conducting placement testing for the freshmen for the first time ever.  We professors had to administer all the exams, grade them, and give oral interviews to the students who excelled on the written portion.  713 students.  The hardest part for me was not knowing exactly which classes I would be teaching, since we had no idea how many students would fall into each level.  I planned out a working syllabus for the three "remedial" classes that they originally assigned me, but then, lo and behold, there were far less students than predicted for the remedial level, and all three of my classes got switched to Level 1.  But you know, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, since fortunately the syllabi for both classes were almost identical in terms of grading distributions and requirements.  That was certainly smart planning on the part of the placement committee.  I didn't get the book until the day before class started though.  Despite the stress of the whole process, however, I really see how the placement testing paid off.  Compared to my day class last semester, I already feel more efficient in teaching my classes this semester because the students are generally similar in level.  Last semester I had several really weak students, and a couple who were strong enough that they should have been exempt from the class altogether.  It made it difficult to prepare, knowing that some would be lost while others would be bored.  So in the end, the craziness of last week was worth it, and it encourages me to know that with each school year the whole process will become more and more finetuned.  In fact, apparently this method of EFL placement at the university level is pretty novel in Korea.  The ministry of education actually donated a building to the language department so that Handong would become a pilot program and a model for other higher educational institutions in Korea! It's pretty exciting, and I feel honored to be a part of it.  The new building should be up by next semester, and I'll be in a brand new office, maybe even overlooking the rice paddies and the ocean if I get an upper floor office facing east. ^^  My schedule this semester is much much better.  If you recall, last semester I taught seven sections, all different courses, and therefore  seven  preps. This semester I teach 5 sections, 2 courses.  The first course I already mentioned: frosh EFL Level 1 (entitled English Communication), three sections.  The second is a night course (for adults in the community) called Junior Communication, for which I have two sections.  Can you believe that I went from seven preps down to two?????? My teaching hours are similar though (18hr/wk, vs 19 last semester), because they increased the hours of EFL instruction for frosh from 2 hrs/wk to 4 hrs/wk. Oof, that was complicated. Hope you are following me. ^^  In addition, my director (he's the best ^^) made it so that my schedule wouldn't be so split. Last semester, I taught five nights a week, and four mornings a week! Sometimes I would be in the office morning, noon, and night for that reason.  I had to really discipline myself to go home in the middle of the day and take a rest.  This semester, my director and I worked it out so that I would teach the last three periods in the day.  It's better that way, since my day classes run straight into my night classes with a dinner break in between.  So now I teach four "late afternoons" and three nights a week.  It's wonderful. I love it, since I prefer the morning hours for my personal time anyway.    I have yet to make personal use of those morning hours, however, since I've been so busy that I've been coming in by 10am every day anyway.  That  will  change though.  I am planning to use that time to spend with God, go running or to the gym, and do some of my hobbies....hopefully I will get into a pattern where I prep for my classes at nights and chill in the mornings.  We'll see.  I already enjoy my classes, and I look forward to what this semester holds in store.  It's gonna be good!!!!  I am afraid that if I keep loving my job this much, I might never want to leave Handong.  But the nice thing is, I can always come back after grad school as a lit prof.  It's nice to have that option, and it makes the thought of leaving next year less difficult.  Who knows what will happen? Only God.   Lately I've been feeling a little down though.  Maybe it's because I haven't made much time for myself.  Overworking is bad for you, it really is.  I haven't really been able to sit down and reflect and do all the little things I like to do everyday.  That can be such a bummer. All those little things add up for holistic well-being.^^ Last night though, Jo and I played ping pong in the gym and later a game of basketball with some of our night students.  I haven't laughed so hard or run around so much in awhile. It felt good, refreshing.  Still, I need to take some time out just to be by myself, too, like right now.  Catch up on reflecting.  Spend time singing praises to the Lord, one my all time favorite things to do.  Read a good book.  Give myself the time and solitude to be creative, sketch or write a poem or work on that song I am trying to write (a measly little refrain at the moment). And so many other little things.  I've said before that I am a jack of all trades and master of none, and it's funny...it's really my nature, so even though I know that all these little activities will not amount to much in the end in terms of measurable accomplishment, I still have to and must do them, simply because they are my release.  They give me immense personal satisfaction.  Another thing that is definitely affecting my mood is the state of world affairs.  I know that I said I would, but I don't know if I am going to write about all my opinions on what is going on, because it's draining.  Everyday I watch the news and I feel frustrated, sad, mad, helpless, and I constantly wonder.....Lord, when?  Today I read in the gospel of Mark the part where Jesus talks about the end times, and if these aren't it then I don't know what is.  Time passes, and I only see men getting more depraved, more hopeless, their minds more darkened.    Jesus will not return until the gospel has reached all the nations, but what about nations like Spain, or the rest of modern Europe? Most Christians consider Europe as a "reached" part of the world, but I feel like a new "nation" has overtaken the old one that  was  "reached," the sort of nation that isn't defined by blood, but by philosophy, ideas.  When I was in Spain, I can honestly attest that most of the younger generations have NO idea who Jesus is. They've heard his name, and think they know who He is, but I would categorize them as "unreached" because they've never heard even one proclamation of the  truth , the gospel.  What's worse is that they've been conditioned to close their ears to the truth, just in case they hear it, you know what I mean?  Theologically, the concept of "nations" is not quite so concrete, I think, because the Bible was obviously not thinking of "nations" in terms of the literal borders designated by the world, since those are subject to change and are not culturally monolithic in and of themselves anyway.  Time, changing intellectual climates, not to mention societal structures and culture, multiplied by human mortality, can make for generational cultural makeovers and therefore new "nations," no? My point is not to pursue some random theological inquiry; it's just that the urgency of the spreading the gospel is so  real  to me lately, with my recent trips to Europe and the recent talk of war .  What if the extent of the unreached is much much greater than the 10/40 window we always pray about?  How much more, then, do we need Christians out there filling all the world with salt and light?  Anyway, those are some thoughts lately.  I also feel a little lonely. I miss home these days.  I miss LA and my family and friends there.  Oh and the Bay Area and my friends there too.  Fortunately Allen is coming to Korea, and he's gonna stop by Handong on his way to visiting relatives in Busan and Daegoo!  I am really looking forward to seeing him. It'll be good good good to catch up.  And I am really really looking forward to going to Cali in the summer. I'll be there mid June-ish, so please call me and plan on hanging out with me. ^^

      The first real Seeker's Cafe study was today, and the hot topic was Christian Liberty. It was AWESOME.  11 students showed up, a perfect number given the size of my apartment and the sort of dynamic I wanted for discussion.    I decided to present it from the angle of ultra Reformed Christian Liberty (which I believe is totally biblical anyway), since for the most part young Korean Christians have one only been taught legalism.  We looked closely at passages/verses from Galations, Titus, Hebrews, and Romans.  I allowed them to speak Korean to each other and to me (since the seeker's cafe is not a language-learning- oriented study), although of course I spoke English to them.  That worked out beautifully, because it got them comfortable, talkative, and strangely enough, super analytical since they were trying to figure out the English verses in Korean.  I think the part that jazzed them the most was Paul's emphasis in Romans 7 and Galations 5 that the two extremes, legalism vs. self-indulgence, are BOTH forms of slavery that kill.  They already knew that in relation to self-indulgence, but they had not thought of it in light of legalism.  We spent a lot of time discussing just what legalism is, and looking at Scripture to see what the harmful results of legalism actually are.  I tried to emphasize above all that God wants us to grow in character and in the faculties of wisdom and prudence, all of which are short-circuited when we take the easy way out and make black and white laws to be used for every grey situation.  We talked about many more integral issues surrounding this topic, but I don't have the energy to go into them all at the moment.  It was one of those discussions where everyone was on the same page, the momentum building as the study progressed.  Confirmation to me that Scripture had really spoken the truth to them came at the end of the study: I told them that I drank wine once in awhile and that I loved going to salsa dance clubs, and they didn't even flinch.  They were just nodding their heads, fully understanding that "to the pure, all things are pure."    I can't wait until next week.  It'll be Part 2 of Christian Liberty: Nurturing Freedom in our Relationship with Christ.  This week's focus was Christian liberty as it is lived out in the world.  The next question is, what does freedom look like in my personal, intimate relationship with the Lord?  The other week, one student quite insightfully asked the question, "I know that after I accept Christ, I am supposed to be free.  But I don't feel free.  What is the meaning and feeling of real freedom?" That's the prompt that will be the seed for next week's study.  I think that I'll be using material from Richard Foster's  The Celebration of Discipline .   dear chang: thanks so much for the white horse inn CD you gave to me last year.  it really helped me prepare for today.

      Wow, thanks for all the great comments everyone.  You had a lot of valid points and cogent arguments.  I totally understand Slim &co who say that safer is better than unwittingly getting tangled in an unhealthy emotional mess .  But I also appreciate Jan's and Martin's comments-- that there is some refreshing beauty and freedom in letting down protective guards (which jan so insightfully pointed out is often more a product of pride than actual "protection"; in my case I think that I am the one acting on a pride that might be sinful, although jan is probably right that men could be more honest about their motivations too), and in letting another person get just close enough to see the ugly (how did you know that I was a weirdo, Martin? hehe I thought that I hid it pretty well).     So my conclusion? I'm still not quite sure.  Talked to Jess again, and she made a good point that you deal with each person uniquely because everyone is different.  And I think that that's what I am going to adjust. Instead of having a sweeping, rigorous methodology with men, I am going to go with the flow more and follow my natural inclinations a little more.  But just a  little  more, because I recognize that there is always the danger that Slim pointed out of getting emotionally involved in a way that should only be reserved for my husband.  I don't ever want to get that intimate in a friendship with a guy until I meet, you know,  him .  Basically this all means that I am going to keep doing what I have been doing, but leaving more room for what I previously called "exceptions", so that they are no longer "exceptions", but just my clos-"er" guy friends. But my best friends will always be women until I get married.  to the other chi:  you'll be leaving for korea just when I'll have gotten back!  i'll prolly be back june 20 or 21! but you'll still be here in korea when I return, since i should be back mid august. i guess we could hang out in seoul then. miss ya.

      It's one of those days.  I feel sad for no good reason.  It's beautiful outside though.  Thank God for the sun, thank God for those amazing, huge, puffy clouds that you just want to eat up.  Thank God for that powerful wind that sweeps them across the sky so that it almost feels like the land is moving and the clouds standing still.  Random thought.  Why is it that friendships between men and women have to be so complicated? I suppose that they don't  have  to be complicated, but they always have been for me, because I have always recognized the constant potential of something else developing on either side other than "just friend"-liness.  My method for years has been to let my male friends in only up to a certain point, a boundary which is nowhere near as intimate as I let my female friends in.  There have been only a select few male friends that I have trusted enough to pass that boundary, but even that has sometimes "backfired."  But lately I've been wondering.....am I missing out by closing off half the world from knowing me....me, the real Sandy, and not the afraid-I'll-hurt-you-or-you'll-hurt-me-so-I-am-going-to-be-distant Sandy?   I had a talk with my roomie, Jess, about this the other day, and she is almost my opposite when it comes to dealing with male friends.  She lets herself be just as intimate with her male friends as she is with her female friends.  She chooses to take the risk, because she thinks it's worth it to know anyone and to let anyone know her that well.  She did admit that it could be "dangerous" sometimes, but she just knows how to deal with it, and she deals with it as it comes.  She doesn't think 1000 steps ahead the way I do with men.  I have a tendency to sweep men that I know immediately into one of three categories, almost as soon as I meet them: 1) someone who could be a friend, 2) someone who could never be a friend, and 3) someone whom I could potentially like.  Honestly, men very rarely fall into the last category.  I would say that only two, or maybe three times in my life has anyone fallen into that category.   And usually, when I set up the customary boundaries, the motivation more often than not is a fear that the guy might like me.  I don't want to hurt anyone.  I don't want to reject anyone.    I am realizing that what I do is very prideful.  If you analyze it, you could basically conclude that I think that any guy I know will like me.  How lame is that!  When I think about it, it makes me feel ashamed.  And you know what? I am tired, really tired, of all this juggling of and analyzing and reading into and dancing around and shutting off from my male friends....especially the ones that I just really like as people, even if I don't think that I could ever like them romantically.  I'd like finally to be free to get to know them deeply, free to be simply myself.  I am beginning to feel like I am missing out.    The issue is, what if I do end up hurting them by letting them in? Or what if I end up hurting myself? Before, those were big enough deterrents.  But now I am not so sure.  Now I am wondering if it is better to risk such hurt for the sake of the greater treasures in getting to know and care about a person, regardless of whether or not the person is male or female.  I don't want to have to care about gender.   But really, I just don't know what's wise anymore.    I can't believe that I'm writing about this here, but if you have any strong opinions on the topic, write me a shout out.

      Jess and I had a bunch of colleagues over for dinner today, and all in all we had a good time.  When the service this morning became a topic of conversation, however, things got a little tense in a debate over whether or not the hip hop dance was appropriate for the service.    Jess and I couldn't believe it, because we were both incredibly blessed by it.  But there were some who thought that some things are better left out of a Sunday worship service, that there should be some level of "sacredness" and "reverence" preserved.  My question was, well, what is your definition of "sacred"?  Is your definition bibically based, or culturally based (Christian culture, that is)? The dance performance powerfully portrayed the gospel, albeit through a medium that is usually considered very secular.  But why should dance be sinful?  What makes it sinful, except that it has been twisted and corrupted by fallen man?  But the thing in itself is not sin.  It is good, because God made it.  Dance is just another form of creative expression in which we can reflect the image of God the Creator.    Jess and I were arguing that even dance could be and should be redeemed for the glory of God, that it should be seen and done in light of the Christian worldview.  Someone said, "Well, I understand that, but then shouldn't it look different from what's done secularly?"  I didn't understand what he meant though, because this morning's performance was entirely centered on Christ.  Did he mean the discrete movements themselves? How are we supposed to create distinctly Christian dance movements?  That's like saying that if you want to be Christian, you need to create a brand new language in which to communicate, for fear that using the same language as nonChristians might be less acceptable to God.  That's obviously absurd, because God made it so that we be in, though not of, the world.  Well the same goes for dance.  I think that because Jess and I are dancers, we know what a wonderful thing dance is.  We know firsthand the amazing experience of using your entire body in a thrilling interpretation of music and movement.  That's why it is so obvious to us that it is not incompatible with worshipping the Lord, that it too could be "sacred."    "Then David danced before the Lord with all his might....Michal, Saul's daughter, looked through a window and saw King David leaping and whirling before the Lord and she despised him in her heart......[she said to him],'How glorious was the king of Israel today in the eyes of the maids his servants, as one of the base fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!'    So David said to Michal, 'It was before the Lord, who chose me instead of your father and all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel.  Therefore I will play music before the Lord.  And I will be even more undignified than this, and will be humble in my own sight'..." (excerpted from 2 Samuel 6)

      Today people all around the world are celebrating the most important moment in the history of humankind: the day Jesus Christ arose from the dead.  I got a picture of that today at Handong's English Service.  Some international students from Russia, China, and Fiji sang special praise songs in their languages, a student from China's Yanbian University gave an amazing testimony of how she was saved, the president of Handong sang all four verses of the hymn Amazing Grace in English, the head chaplain recited all of Matthew 1 in English, and a korean hip hop group on campus performed the drama of Christ's resurrection in our lives in a most innovative and creative theatrical dance routine.  My eyes kept tearing throughout the service, because the beauty of the gospel was so overwhelming in light of God's work in the world at large.  He IS alive, and the Body of Christ in the world grows in number, in unity, and in vision, as He works in each individual believer's life.  Those international students were brought by God to Handong, just as I was 9 months ago, and it is just such an honor to meet them, if only to serve as a reminder to me that there is so much more than just  here .    God is taking variegated threads of rich colors and rare materials, weaving them together into a special tapestry, splendid beyond imagination. You and I are a part of that.        But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed.  You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified.  He is risen!  He is not here.  See the place where they laid Him." Mark 16:6

      Whew. What a day.  I had my first Bible Study labs today, and it was awesome, but tiring.  I finished my day classes around 6 for that reason, and then had to come back to teach an evening class from 9:30 to 11:05pm.  Thursdays are going to be really wearisome.  But tonight I am going to sleep well, and my heart is full.    The students responded really well to the study.  We are going through the first part of Ephesians 1, and we are taking it turtle pace, I tell ya! But it's good for us, because the riches of God's Word are so immense.  We are tearing the text apart, really using the tools of grammar to help us read more deeply into Scripture. A really simple yet profound example: "...he chose us..." Who is the subject? "He." So who is doing  the choosing? "God." Who did He choose? "Us."  'What tense is "chose"? "Simple past."  Simple past signifies a completed action, once and for all, totally finished.  And we talked about those three words for at least 10 minutes, and all it's theological implications-- discussing God in His sovereignty, His glory, and His LOVE toward us, especially considering that he completed all the simple past actions "before the creation of the world."  That's just a taste of the linguistic flavor of this kind of bible study, but you would have loved the discussion of Paul's use of the present perfect tense. :)   The first Seeker's Cafe was at my place on Tuesday night, too, and that was great.  15 of us were squeezed into my tiny apartment, and we just ate snacks and had a blast playing icebreakers.  Toward the latter part of the evening, we quieted down the mood and I had them write down all their questions or doubts about Christianity.  We'll be using those questions as the topical bases for future meetings.  They wrote a bunch of great questions, but they all more or less fell into four categories:  1) The tension in "knowing" God when He is both transcendent and immanent, 2) The problem of suffering and evil, 3) Christian liberty, and 4) General criticisms of Christianity as an institution.    I am so excited about this.  Several nonbelievers showed up at the meeting on Tuesday, as well as the bs labs today.  And I am encouraged by all the Christians who have such a desire to study the Word in English and be equipped apologetically.  Please please pray for me, that I would teach the Word of God uncompromisingly, and with a transparent and loving heart.  I really love my students.  Just seeing the looks in their eyes as we were sharing in the love of God through His Word.....it was precious.  They are so hungry to know Him!   Oh God, what am I? What can I do? Speak for me!

      Today Ro and I sat under a quaint cherry blossom tree with our brown bag lunches.  There was a pleasant breeze, so that every so often a lone petal would drift onto my head, or my shoulder, and Ro would pick it off.  We had such an easy, comfortable conversation.    Ro is gorgeous.   In the first few months of knowing her I never noticed, but as I have gotten to know her better, her beauty radiates.  Maybe even moreso because she doesn't even know it.  There is such this unassuming air about her that is almost captivating.  Joyce and I were hounding her the other day about what kind of man she'd like to marry someday.  She doesn't know.  Her first experience of puppy love was fleeting and innocent, and she didn't pursue it or any other relationship because she knew that she wasn't ready.  She did say though,  I haven't ever felt that I needed a man, but I know that when I meet him, I'll need him.   I love that.  That's Ro.  Quietly confident, romantic in her own way, the converse of the manipulative archetypal Eve.  Her personality is as feminine and soft as it is adventuresome and bold.  It's spring, and the cherry blossoms are now in full bloom.  What Ro doesn't know is that they reminded me of her, even as she was picking them off of me.   cherry blossom, take off from the bark pure, fresh, delicate dancing with the breeze,  slowly,  gently, wafting  down to the  wide wide earth, ready.

      So I'm all better already.  It only lasted 24 hours, thank goodness.      Anyway, an update on what is happening with my classes.  Between my three sections, I'd say that a dozen students or so  didn't  sign up!  And, since I offered a "Seeker's Cafe" in addition, many signed up for both! At the end of the day on Friday, I found myself with a mess on my hands.....how in the world was I going to manage SIX small groups all by myself?  I worried about it all weekend.    But now I have a new plan.  I am going to see the bible study as a sort of lab for the course, since nearly everyone signed up anyway.  It'll be once a week, right after all my class periods.  See, it's beautiful, because Handong has 90 minute periods, but frosh english classes are only 50 minutes long.  That leaves 40 minutes in which the students have no commitments whatsoever.  I can end class a little early on the bible study days so that we can have a good 45 to 50 minutes for bs, sharing, praying, and singing.  I am planning on using the manuscript study technique (InterVarsity? It's where you have Scripture typed out in big font, double spaced, with large margins on the page, so that you can mark it all up) because I think it will lend itself well to ESL students.  I can have them circling action words, underlining powerful adjectives, etc....I want the students to be discovering the meaning of Scripture using the skills they learn in my class, so in that sense it will be somewhat academic at the same time that it will be devotional (hopefully).    As for the Seeker's Cafe, I decided that it is not as important that we meet every week for its purposes, so I am going to rotate the sections.  I'll have one section a week coming over to my place for goodies and apologetics. :) The first meetings will be Q&A, and subsequent meetings building upon the common themes and questions that will have come up.  I am really excited about this, maybe even more than the lab bs, because this experience is going to force me to polish my own apologetic approaches. Lately I've done a lot of apologetical reading, and I am eager to share the knowledge.  Please pray for me.  This could be a powerful ministry if it works out well.  I've converted my roomie, Jess, too.  She heard my idea, got all excited about it, and is going to try it with her classes too!

      Can you believe it, I forgot to announce last night's seeker's cafe in my first class, so I just canceled it altogether.  I was feeling really tired out anyway, and thought that it might be better if we waited until next week to talk about the "Problem of Evil."  My 4th period students called and asked me to have dinner with them instead, though, so we ate a good dinner and shot some pool afterwards.  Then we took a nice long walk around campus and they walked me home.  It was really sweet of them.  I think that I needed some time to just relax and have some fun like that.  It was good.    I have changed my itinerary for the States.  I am flying into SFO on June 23rd at 11:10 (am?).  I'll be there for about 4-5 days before I drive down to LA with my old drawmmates that weekend.  Those of you in the Bay Area, let's plan on hanging out!!!!!!!! I miss you guys!!!!!!!!!! At least half the time will be dedicated entirely to my Stanford drawmmates though! ^^  See you soon!

      Last night I cried my eyes out to Joyce.  I feel better now.  Today I am just going to relax by myself, spend a long time with the Lord, and maybe go into town later so that I can study Korean and read Kant in a cafe.  I wanted to share one quote that I read last night in Ravi Zacharias' book,  Cries of the Heart  (he is quoting Martin Lloyd-Jones'  Spiritual Depression ):   The main art in the matter of spiritual living is to know how to handle yourself.  You have to take yourself in hand.  You have to address yourself, preach to yourself, question yourself.  The essence of this matter is to understand that this self of ours, this other man within us, has got to be handled.  Do not listen to him; turn on him; speak to him; condemn him; upbraid him; exhort him; encourage him; remind him of what you know instead of placidly listening to him and allowing him to drag you down and depress you.   These words were so right on for me last night.  I've been "placidly listening" to the lies that Satan has been telling me about me.  It has brought me down, and yesterday was the lowest.  Everything seemed to go wrong and by the end of the day I felt defeated, useless, and sinful.  Joyce was such a sweetheart-- she really listened to me with empathy and sympathy, which is what I needed.  I can feel her prayers for me.  Today will be different.  I am going to meditate on God's truth and let Him tell me who I am.

      Tonight, as I was observing my adult students eagerly going about their tasks in small groups, it hit me afresh how lucky I am to be here at Handong.  I remember that around this time last year, I was interviewing for the job on the phone, and I had no idea what the recruitment coordinator was talking about when he said that I would be teaching "Industrial and Social Education" courses.  I actually think that he was purposely trying to be vague, because it would have been easy enough for him to say that I'd be teaching continuing ed classes for adults.  But I like teaching them.  Tonight they evoked in me a feeling of tenderness as I saw them laughing together and encouraging each other in collaborated creativity.  My day students are cute and spunky, but my night students are persevering and resourceful.  I love them all.  My window is open and I can hear a group of students singing "Here I Am to Worship" in sweet harmony.  Their voices are wafting up through the night air and into my office, making their way into my spirit, uplifting it.   It's been a hard week, for several reasons.  Lately I have felt like a bad teacher, a bad friend, a bad daughter, a bad person.  I know that sounds hyperbolic, but it's honestly how I have felt this week.  I've just felt like a terrible, weak sinner in many ways.  I guess that the Lord is bringing me to the place again where I need to find my strength, and everything good in me, in HIM.  If there is anything that I know right now, at this moment, it's that I NEED Him.

      I just wrote a long entry, and I lost it! :(    Well, I guess I'll try to write it again, but I don't know if I will remember everything.   I have mixed feelings about last night's Seeker's Cafe.  The topic was "Proving the Existence of God," which of course is a fascinating topic, and the subject of many of my students' questions in the survey I gave at the beginning of the semester.  I could not keep the discussion from getting quite philosophical however, and the problem with that was the langauge barrier.  I have said that in past studies the language barrier actually served to work to my students' benefit, because it forced them to look closely at  biblical text and really analyze it in the process of translation.  But last night the language barrier was just that, a barrier.  I kept wishing that I could talk about this stuff in Korean, or that they knew English fluently.  Another difficulty was that though the topic could be a university semester-long course, I was trying to fit in all the main points into one hour and a half session!  I ended up talking most of the time, because if I let them discuss long enough to come to conclusions themselves (which is ideally what should happen), it would have taken way too long.  Still, I can't say that it wasn't beneficial.  I would say that a little more than half the students were really into it, excited about the topic,  and following me every step of the way.  This was fortunate, because I used one of them, Kevin, to translate into Korean for me every so often.  At the end he exclaimed, "Sandra! Tonight I understood you the best, more than in the past.  I think that my English comprehension is getting better!"  He and the other excited students stayed longer afterwards and discussed some more amongst themselves.  What a contrast to three of the students who seemed totally and completely lost! It was so sad for me, because I knew that they were lost more because of the language barrier than the ideas themselves, but I couldn't slow down to catch them up to speed.  It's like I left them in the dust somewhere near the beginning.  I felt horrible about that.  Harry, a student that reminds me of my bro, and who I am really close to and fond of, was one of the clueless ones.  As he was leaving, he had a sad look on his face, and with a wry smile said to me, "That was stressful.  I didn't understand anything.  I am never coming to the Seeker's Cafe again."  He said it jokingly, but I know that he was speaking the truth.  Two non-Christians came.  I was glad that they were interested enough in the topic to come, but I couldn't really tell how much they understood.  They didn't seem lost, since they had these thoughtful looks on their faces, but they didn't say a word the whole time.  At the end, I asked one of them, Haro, if she had understood everything I had said.  Surprisingly she said, "Yes."  She then went on to add, "But I still don't believe in God...yet."  That "yet" is so interesting.  It's like she knows that she will eventually believe or something.  Her friend told me that recently Haro had bought her first Bible, and that she has been reading it on her own.  I encouraged her to come to me if she had any questions about Christianity, and she seemed pretty receptive.  She took down my email address, so I hope that she emails me.      After they left, I just sat on my couch thinking, "I think that I just scared away half of them from ever coming again.  Given the language barrier, shouldn't I make the studies more simplistic?"  The thing is, these are college students, and even if their English abilities are elementary, their thinking capabilities are not.  And what is the Seeker's Cafe about? It's about seeking the truth, and stretching the mind to know God more.  I don't want to compromise that objective.  So I have decided that I am OK if fewer students come from now on, because the ones who do come will be the ones who are really engaged in and excited about deep questions.  If those students also happen to be stronger in English, than so be it.  Next week's topic is "The Problem of Evil."  It's probably going to be pretty philosophical again, so if anyone has any great ideas about how I can get the students discussing about the topic themselves (without me having to speak the whole time), let me know.  Remember that although I speak in English to them, they can speak in Korean with each other and to me.  Help me please....

      geez, talk about moodiness. The last two entries seem like complete polar opposites. Let me just qualify the first entry by saying that I wrote it in a state of recollection, whereas the latter entry I was writing in a state of the here and now. It's funny how a person can be so complex as to have different levels of consciousness, of which we can slip in and out depending on the context of activity....

      The light of the hazy sun filters in through the dirty window in my office, casting a glaring gloom onto my desk. I am trying to prep and grade, but my thoughts are distracted.  A strange, existential sort of dissatisfaction makes me feel listless, restless.  I want to cry, and I am not sure why, except for this amorphous feeling of dirtiness tumbling inside of me and pushing into me at the same time.  I am such a sinner. Why can't I love people more? Lord!  Sanctify me!

      I have laryngitis.  I am croaking around like a frog.  How am I going to teach come Monday???  I started feeling a sore throat on Monday, and it has just gotten progressively worse with all the singing, talking, yelling, and laughing I've been doing this past week.  I need to rest my voicebox and drink a lot of water, so says the website on home treatment for health problems.   The performance on Wednesday night went pretty well, considering that it was raining (perfect for our first piece, I guess...we were literally getting wet as we were singing, "A Little Fall of Rain") and the sound system wasn't too hot.  But Abraham and I were received enthusiastically by the students.  They were woohing and aahing and clapping all over the place, as Koreans love to do. And, it was the first time in my life that I wasn't nervous performing in front of a large audience!  I couldn't believe it.  I felt totally comfortable on stage. Maybe I am finally over the stage fright that has plagued me all my life! In that respect, the experience was quite exhilarating for me personally.  Besides that, the Food Festival was a blast, and our food turned out well.  We sold out of tortilla espanola and ceviche in like ten minutes! But more than our own cooking, the highlight for me was tasting Fijian chicken slow-cooked in the ground.  Delicious.  The MT was cancelled due to bad weather, but my students called me yesterday and I am going to hang out with some of them tonight since it's beautiful today.  Wonder how they are going to understand me when my English speaking friends can hardly understand my croaking? Hehe, it'll make for an interesting experience I'm sure.  Not a very interesting entry, I know, but thought I'd just jot down an update.  I know that my last entry was only four days ago, but it seriously seems like a month has passed since then.

      The Festival starts today, so I don't have to teach for the rest of the week! But my schedule is still packed...  Tonight I am making a "guest appearance" ^^ at the singing contest with another prof, Abraham Lee, and we are singing "A Little Fall of Rain" from Les Miserables, and another song called "Savior Lead Us."  We only started practicing yesterday, so we don't have it together yet! Agh! But we'll be practicing this morning, so hopefully we'll be ready by tonight....I know the first song pretty well, but "Savior Lead Us" is a brand new song for me and I barely got the melody down at 1 am last night.  Anyway, I'll let you know how it goes.  I have to admit that practicing has been really fun.  It's been a long time since I've sung songs like these solo, songs that are really dramatic and stuff.  I've been only singing praise for years now it seems.  On Thursday, I am going on an "MT" with my 6th period class, which I guess is something like a mini-retreat.  Apparently we are going to eat lunch, walk to Chilpo beach, play games there and sing and have fun, eat dinner, play more throughout the night, and watch the sunrise before we come back to campus.  Sounds fun, since I adore this class (they are soooo sweet, cute, and spunky), but I know that it's going to be mucho tiring.  Then, on Friday morning, students are coming to our house to make food for the Global Food Festival. Last Sunday we taught a group of them how to make ceviche (delicious!) and tortilla espanola, so this week they are buying all the ingredients and stuff so that we'll be ready to go on Friday morning for some mad cookin.  We'll cook all morning long, and then participate in the food festival, which begins at 1:30 that day.    Crazy week!!!!!!!!! Hopefully I'll be able to relax on Saturday, although I've promised someone I'd play basketball with them, and I am tempted to go to Busan for some dancing (they have salsa AND swing clubs there!!!!) with Jess.  We'll see.  If I keep running around like this, though, I am going to collapse. :)

      The weather is acting strange.  It rained all day long, and the winds have been blowing ferociously since midafternoon.  It made for a beautiful sight, actually.  Whenever I would look out the window, this eerie mist was hovering over everything...the trees, now brilliantly green, madly thrashing about, the wet ground shining....  I don't have any classes on Wednesdays, so since my 2 hour departmental meeting ended around 2:30, I've just been chillin at home.  Jess was gone to town all evening, so I made use of the privacy and snuggled up on the couch, dimmed the lights, read for several hours, napped, watched some korean dramas, and read again.  Today I decided to take a break from grading and prepping altogether.  I've been reading the collected works of St. John of the Cross, a Spanish mystic monk from the 16th century.  While I don't agree with the theology he espouses in his prose (you know, arduous ascetism and the disassociation of the spirit from anything earthly) I think that his poetry is absolutely beautiful.  They have the original Spanish in the back, so after I read the poems in English, I began reading them aloud in Spanish.  That, along with the wind howling outside, shaking the windows from time to time, made for quite a mysterious mood.    One thing that strikes me about the mystics was their uncanny ability to grasp, or should I say experience, the ineffable love of God.  This is one thing that their constant removal from the daily distractions of the world could have afforded them, I suppose.  Regarding one of his poems, which a nun asked him to explain, St. John wrote, "I have felt...somewhat reluctant to explain these four stanzas as you asked.  Since they deal with matters so interior and spiritual, for which words are usually lacking--  in that the spiritual surpasses sense-- I find it difficult to say something of their content; also one speaks badly of the intimate depths of the spirit if one does not do so with a deeply recollected soul."     The poem he is referring to is called "The Living Flame of Love,"  which describes the ecstatic, intimate union of the soul with God.  O living flame of love That tenderly wounds my soul In its deepest center! Since Now You are not oppressive, Now Consummate! if it be Your will: Tear through the veil of this sweet encounter!  O sweet cautery, O delightful wound! O gentle hand! O delicate touch That tastes of eternal life           And pays every debt!                In killing You changed death to life.  O lamps of fire!                              In whose splendors The deep caverns of feeling, Once obscure and blind, Now give forth, so rarely, so exquisitely, Both warm and light to their Beloved.       How gently and lovingly You wake in my heart,  Where in secret You dwell alone;   And in Your sweet breathing,         Filled with good and glory, How tenderly You swell my heart with love.  I understand what he means about explaining poetry.  I don't think that I could really fully explain any of my poems to anyone.  I wrote them for the very reason that I could not articulate what I was feeling or thinking at the moment in prosaic language. I write for myself more than anyone, so I know that a lot of times people might read my poetry page and wonder what the heck I am talking about.....oh well. It's a form of expression for me, not necessarily communication.  Of course, if it does communicate anything to anyone, then that gives me pleasure too.   But I  get  his poem.  To me, it is brilliant. While I was reading it, along with his much longer poem "The Spiritual Canticle,"  my heart began to beat faster as the magnificence of the love of God washed over me....especially in the dulcet tones of Spanish...  Oh llama de amor viva, Que tiernamente hieres, De mi alma en el mas profundo centro! Pues ya no eres esquiva, Acaba ya, si quieres; Rompe la tela de este dulce encuentro.  Oh cauterio suave! Oh regalada llaga!                   Oh mano blanda! Oh toque delicado, Que a vida eterna sabe, Y toda deuda paga!  Matando, muerte en vida la has trocado.   Oh lamparas de fuego,   En cuyos resplandores   Las profundas cavernas del sentido,  Que estaba oscuro y ciego, Con extranos primores Calor y luz dan junto a su Querido!  Cuan manso y amoroso Recuerdas en mi seno Donde secretamente solo moras; Y en tu aspirar sabroso De bien y gloria lleno Cuan delicadamente me enamoras!

      This past weekend was a long weekend because Children's Day was on Monday.  Ro, Joyce, Joanne, and I went to Seoul and stayed in a nice motel for three nights.  We had a blast just shopping, going to the movies, eating out, etc.  It was great fun! My only regret is that we didn't get to go swing dancing or to the jazz club that I went to with Yohan. Next time, I guess. Jess did mention to me today that she found out about some happening salsa scenes in Busan and Daegoo, which are only a couple of hours away by bus.  I might be taggin along with her and her Pohang dancing buddies for some salsa shakin. :)  The best part of my trip to Seoul were the times in the evenings before we would go to sleep.  We would pray together, read Scripture aloud, and sing praise songs in such a natural, organic way.  The beauty of sisters in Christ.  It was such a pleasant way of ending a full day of rompin around the big city-- settling down in utmost comfort, and letting the peace of God reign in our hearts.  I still prefer Handong though.  We arrived here last night, and as we made our way around the bends of the narrow highway that leads to our school in the coastal mountains, the vision of the vast ocean at night, the silouettes of trees against the moonlight, the scent of pine and salt and rice fields mingling and filling my soul as I breathed it all in....all of it called out home to me.    What do I mean by home?  Well, when I was young I had always dreamed of living in nature.  I loved to read books set in the eighteenth or nineteenth century British (Austen, the Brontes) or American (Louisa May Alcott) or Canadian (LM Montgomery) countryside.  When I would draw pictures, I would always envision a woman walking through the woods, the wind blowing her hair and ruffling her light dress, only to be sorely disappointed with what I actually produced on paper.  When I was in middle school, I would gaze out the window at the sky past the hill just behind our house, wondering what land met it on the other side of the summit.  I would imagine fields stretching across for miles, with big trees for me to climb, and bubbling creeks for me to dip my feet in.  Little did I know that Los Angeles did not cradle such idyllic scenery! :)  When I finally reached the top of the hill in junior high, I was monumentally disappointed to find that all there was were just more identical urban condos, just like mine.  :(  My brother and I would play around our "Great Wall of China," though, which was this random slab of broken wall on the hill on which we could sit and watch a fantastic LA sundown.    I would love it when my family would go camping.  We would make these two to three week treks up the west coast with another family, stopping at camp grounds along the way, sleeping in tents, and making Korean food on portable burners.  The smell of burning firewood outside and the sound of zipping tents remind me of those camping trips to this day.  We stopped camping in the summers once the oldest child of the two families went away to college-- at the time I was just entering high school.  I never told anyone this, but I was really really sad about it.  For some reason I associated the end of camping with the end of my childhood, most likely because my summers thereafter were filled with pre-college-application activities. But once, just once, when I was in college, my family resurrected the camping tradition and we went by ourselves to a nearby campsite on a night with no moon.  After the rest had gone to sleep, I laid outside on a rock for hours, just watching the dozens of shooting stars and getting eaten by mosquitoes.    Even senior year at Stanford, when I discovered my passion for English lit, the period and genre in literature that captivated me the most was British Romantic poetry, which in essence celebrates the beautiful and the sublime in Nature with a capital N.  And everyday I would retreat to the Stanford foothills in the crisp of the morning, where I had discovered for myself special nooks and crannies that nearly satisfied my quest for solitude in nature.  There were eroded crevices that became bubbling brooks during the rainy season, and even huge, strong trees which I could climb up and sit in for hours.    The dreams I had as a child of communing with nature did not by any means fade away with time; no, the more I experienced it, the more it whetted my appetite.  Handong is the zenith so far.  I really can find genuine stretches of nature here.  I have the woods at my backdoor, the ocean within view and a hike's reach, rice paddy fields to stroll in, and a beautiful natural lake just a short walk from the edge of campus.  For a long time I hated the city, especially Los Angeles.  But living in San Francisco last year won me over.  I fell in love with that city, and as a result, have come to appreciate cities in general.  I thought that I could never live in an urban area, but now I think that I can, as long as I have nature within reach for an occasional breath of fresh air.  I recently wrote this in an email to jan, but it's worth repeating here since it's on the same train of thought. For me, nature is the beauty of God's pure creation, whereas the city holds the beauty and frailty of man's creativity. I love nature more because in nature I can see more clearly who God is in His majesty and holiness, and I can be with Him in a more intimate and focused solitude (this is just me, of course...God touches each person uniquely). But I do love the city too, because it is the place of man's creation, which is beautiful and ugly at the same time.   How did this blog get so long? All I wanted to say was that it is nice to be home. :) It rained today, but I hope that the sun comes out tomorrow so that I can take a nice, long, peaceful walk.  Tonight was the second Seeker's Cafe, and I was glad to see two non-Christians come this time.  We had a great time talking about freedom in our personal relationship with God, centering the discussion around His infinite unchanging love toward us.  We discussed in detail the passage in John 20 where Jesus appears to Mary after His resurrection, as well as the Trinitarian moment of Jesus' baptism in Luke 3, and it was powerful.  From those two passages we exegeted the doctrine of the Trinity and the necessity of love in God's nature, as well as the absolute personalness of that love toward us.  As Brenning Manning once said, "Being loved by God is far more important than loving God."  It's the difference between grace and works.  Both are important, but there is a proper sequence of what comes first so that the other might follow.  Of first importance is simply being, not doing.  Please pray for the non Christians who came today.  While the students were discussing the questions and passages in pairs, I was praying for them.  They are genuinely seeking...they both regularly attend the bible study labs on Thursdays as well.  Please pray that God would speak the truth to their hearts, and that the truth will set them free.

      I am in the United States.  It has been at once wonderful and strange.  Wonderful seeing my great friends, catching up with them, and talking until the wee hours of the morning.  Wonderful eating Mexican and Vietnamese food, wonderful cruising around the neighborhood of my college years, wonderful experiencing the flood of memories that each familiar nook and cranny resurrects.    But strange too.  Strange readjusting myself to American culture, strange realizing how much people have changed, even stranger vaguely sensing how much I have changed since I was here last.  I haven't had the chance to really sit down and reflect since I have arrived but there seems to be much substrate slowly accruing.

      In Seoul right now.  Kinda spontaneous.  I have piles of grading to do, and I just didn't want to be holed up at Handong while doing it.   For some reason the thought of going to Seoul and sitting in a cafe to grade seemed much more palatable. haha, well, I guess that wasn't the only reason.  Two other motivating factors for the actualization of such a capricious impulse were 1) the thought of seeing my aunt again (and eating her good food), and 2) the opportunity of dancing all night long at the swing festival here on Sunday night.  Those three elements were enough for me to spend 60,000 won on a round trip train ticket that would keep me in Seoul for only two days and three nights, not to mention 5 hours of sitting on a train at either end.  Estoy loca, me dices? Well, no, it's perfect actually.  I found myself grading like a mad woman on the train ride here, so that if I do the same thing on the train ride back, I can actually finish what I brought without actually having to grade much while I am in Seoul.  Today I am going to go to a cafe in Myung Dong, grade for just an hour, and spend a few more hours reading my own books and studying Korean.  Too bad I didn't bring Spanish to study, I probably could have fit that in too...  I have noticed that I have an idiosyncratic method of time management.  I really guard my non-working time, so I try to maximize it as much as possible.  For example, I don't teach until 1:30 pm everyday (since I sometimes teach until 11 pm at night), so I usually leave my prepping until just before I teach (between 11:30am and 12pm, eating my lunch while I am doing it) so that it doesn't impinge on my morning free time.  Or I'll stay up late the night before, right after 6 hours of teaching, so that I don't have to come in at all until 1:20 the next day.  I also rarely work on weekends.  I'd rather stress myself out like crazy and work for 12 hours straight on Mondays than have work encroach on my precious weekends.  My working/non-working times have to be discretely partitioned for me to feel like I am both working and relaxing most productively.  Otherwise, if I mix up work and play throughout a day, I am neither efficiently working nor fully relaxed while playing.    That's why I think Seoul was a good idea this weekend.  It would have driven me nuts to be working throughout the weekend.  It would have also taken me much longer to get things done, because it's hard for me to focus when my work/free time borders get hazy.  But this way, I am working, but mostly on the train, which means that I am getting somewhere and doing something at the same time.  I like that. :)  It totally focuses me, because I know that upon arrival I have "my" time.  By going to Seoul, I was able to re-apportion a space of personal time that had been despoiled by the necessity to work.  Consequently, I am thrilled to find that I now still have some  pure  free time to look forward to this weekend!  Too bad it had to be a little costly. ^^  This is going to be a problem next semester that I will have to find a way to adapt to.  I am going back to a split schedule in which, within a week, I have morning, afternoon, and night classes.  My first semester was like that and I felt like I was working all the time...    Well, not the time to worry about that now.  I'll leave that for Monday.

      Yesterday was a good day.  In the morning I had a sweet time with the Lord.  In the afternoon I held my last classes, so touching that I cried in two of my sections.  In the evening my fourth and sixth period classes played a soccer game against each other, and then a bunch of us went out afterwards to eat and go bowling and to the norebang.  It was such a great time.  I feel like I was laughing all night long, and that was really refreshing.  I'll put up pics once my students send them to me.  In my last classes I shared with them the song I left KCPC with almost exactly one year ago, "He's Always Been Faithful" by Sara Groves.  I didn't have anything to teach them from our textbook, since we were done with the material for the semester, so I had to think of what I wanted to leave them with.  That song immediately came to mind, because the lyrics so beautifully remind us of God's love and sovereignty in our lives.  I mean, that's what faithfulness in perfection is, isn't it? Perfect love mingled with awesome sovereignty.  It is such a powerful message...I think the students were really touched. hehe, usually I would make them photocopies of the song, but this time I wrote the lyrics on the board and made them copy it down for themselves.  It was my trick to make them really pay attention to each word.    We went over vocabulary questions of course, ^^ and then I shared with them the meaning of the song in my life, as well as my favorite line "I can't remember a trial or a pain He did not recycle to bring me gain."  I told them that that song marked the end of 5 years in the Bay Area to travel across the world, not knowing what my life would be like so far from home.  But as I looked at their faces, it brought tears to my eyes to realize in that moment, after a year of teaching at Handong, that God really does know me intimately, that He really does love me perfectly, and that He really is wonderfully sovereign over my life.     He's Always Been Faithful   Morning by morning, I wake up to find  the power and comfort of God's hand in mine. Season by season, I watch Him amazed,  in awe of the mystery of His perfect ways. All I have need of, His hand will provide.  He's always been faithful to me. I can't remember a trial or a pain  He did not recycle to bring me gain.  I can't remember one single regret  in serving God only and trusting His hand. All I have need of, His hand will provide.  He's always been faithful to me. This is my anthem, this is my song,  the theme of the stories I've heard for so long. God has been faithful, He will be again.  His loving compassion, it knows no end. All I have need of, His hand will provide,  He's always been faithful to me.  I asked my students to remember this message for those inevitable moments when life is difficult or just doesn't make sense.  I hope they do.  I'm really really going to miss these classes.  With all the Bible Study labs and Seeker's Cafe's this semester, there is a tremendous feeling of rapport that is going to be hard to let go of and ever recreate again.  I know that last semester I said that my one day class was special to me, but this semester even moreso, because I had the opportunity get to know my students at a deeper level.  I was able to share so much more with them than just English.  It was strange.  I took the CD and my stereo with me to my classes to play the song for them, but whenever I tried, the CD would skip horribly.  In between classes, in my office, the song would play perfectly smoothly.  Uncanny.  So what kept happening was that I would play the first part through before the CD went nuts, fiddle with the CD for a few minutes, trying to get it to work properly, and then I'd end up singing the second verse and on by myself, acappella.  That happened in all three classes! Maybe God wanted me to sing for them, I don't know.  I thought it was pretty funny though.

      How  much I listen might very well be more of an indication of my heart's posture before God than what I say to Him.  Lately I have been dissatisfied with my prayer life...it feels parched of depth, of dynamism.  It's not that I don't care about what I am praying for.  I pray for my friends, my family, my students, Handong, my future, my husband, the world, etc., and I honestly and sincerely care about all of those things.    When I was writing to my friend yesterday, I realized that the problem is not that I don't care enough about the things I am praying for.  It's that I don't care enough about God.  I am focusing on people, things, me, and not on Him.  I've been a Martha in my prayer life.  Martha would probably sit down to pray with an elaborate prayer list, starting immediately and efficiently spewing out prayer items, undoubtedly waxing eloquent when need be.  She would focus on doing her best in prayer for the Lord.    Mary, on the other hand, would just focus on being with Him-- listening to Him, asking questions, wanting to be subsumed by His words and His character.    So now I am trying to be a better listener.  It is incredibly difficult to have enough patience and focus.  I get so easily distracted... I always used to think that discipline in prayer life just meant being consistent, praying everyday.  But that's not enough.  Now I see that it is also about  how  I pray, and that the easier thing to do is just do do do.  The more difficult thing is to actually focus on God Himself, to the point where I become nothing in comparison to His sublime beauty, and He becomes the All in all.   How long have I been praying like this?  I remember that there used to be a time when it was just natural for me to have a Mary-like posture in prayer.  That might have been as far back as when I was a freshmen in college.  Somewhere down the line I forgot that prayer is supposed to influence and change me to conform to God's will, rather than me trying to influence God to conform to my will.  While it is still difficult at this point to focus and have patience, there is nevertheless a breath of release with the resurgence of this simple truth.  Prayer should be a two-way conversation, not a confrontation in which I attempt to accomplish the goals for some pre-established agenda.   When I meet God in prayer, He just wants me to meet Him.  Just to be  with  Him.   It seems that I have been carrying a great weight that's just been lifted off.  Maybe I can fly now.

      This is pretty much the last teaching week, since next week is dead week, and finals is the week after.  This semester went by so fast!!!!!!!!!!!  Tuesday was the last seeker's cafe, and it went really well.  Because of my frustration with the last study a couple of weeks ago, I really thought hard about how to structure this one so that the students would be talking more.  What I did was present them with a few philosophical puzzles and exercises in logic in order to counter the atheistic statement,"Evil exists, therefore God does not exist."  They really got into it, and they made some great insights and asked good questions.  Then we went on to look at Scripture and to discuss the role of suffering in the life of a Christian, as well as the answer to the problem of evil in the cross of Christ.  I kind of wish that we had another study altogether for the latter part, because as it was we couldn't get as deeply into it as I would have liked.  I do think that we all came away from the study having learned something though.    15 students were crammed into my apartment, all from different sections, and afterwards we devoured some ice cream together.  As I watched them take pictures and laughingly jostle each other to get near the little tubs of ice cream, I felt happy and sad at the same time-- happy that I had this great opportunity to teach and learn from these students, sad that I could've done more and that the time was already up.  I want to remember that moment as a source of motivation and inspiration at the beginning of next semester.  After ice cream, we all headed out to the basketball courts. Since 13 of us wanted to play, we had a quasi-tournament with 2 teams of 4 and one team of 5.  My team won! 3 out of 4 games, aw yeah. :)  That was the highlight of this week, to be sure.  It's been up and down for different reasons, but I thank God that He is the one constant in my life.  Yesterday I spent half the day with the Lord, just trying to sit and be with Him, listening to Him. A friend wrote me about desiring to hear God, and her email made me realize that I have been such a Martha in my prayer life.  More on that later.

      What a whirlwind of a weekend.  The most salient moment, however, was Saturday night, when I saw spoken word poet Dennis Kim perform at the Grand Star in Chinatown.    It was absolutely mind-shaking and heart-trembling.  Most of the evening had been loud music, dancing, and hip-hop freestyle units.  But  when he started reading, this heavy hush blanketed over the room, and he just soared with words, words, piercing words.  His poetry is about the beauty and uniqueness of all that is Korean, what it means to be Korean American, what it means to be American, about social justice and spiritual truth.   Twice, or three times, he broke out into the refrains of traditional Korean folk songs that were weaved into his poems.  Whenever he did that, it was such a mesmerizing space of time in which the husky, deep,  true  quality of his voice and the slight american accent with which he sang those refrains that encapsulate the quintessential  maht  of Korea, somehow resonated profoundly, and painfully, with  who I  am  .  During those spells, a vague part of me, which I am not fully in touch with yet but which is deep within my center, just wanted to weep and weep.  I found out that he was also born in '78,  na-rang dong-gap .  That fact somehow struck me as inexplicably warming.  With an unspoken and spiritual  jeong , I feel that he is a brother.  His artistry and passion remind me of how powerful, how beautiful, how  real  poetry can be.    The hungry scent of sorrow on the skin of my people, Han.  The muddy face of my unborn children. Han.  My crooked foot searching for the footprints of my grandfather.  My Han.

      I've been sitting here, wondering what  I should write about.  I feel so numb.  I was talking to a couple of friends last night, and I was sharing with them that being home makes me feel inert, sluggish, and lazy.  There were so many goals and projects I had been planning on working on while I was here, but it seems like I am barely accomplishing anything right now.  What's wrong with me? It's some sorta funk.  So yeah, I've been down on myself.  I am wondering if it's home, or if it's LA.  If it's LA, then that's a problem if I want to go to UCLA for grad school, or any other school in a big city.  Is it something about ultra-urbanness that strips me of all inspiration and energy?  When I am at a place like Handong, my beautiful surroundings alone are enough to get me really excited about the truly important things in life.  But here, in this consumer-driven madness, all I want is immediate gratification for everything that stimulates my superficial desires: trendy clothes, good food, nifty appliances, quick image fixes (infomercials can get tempting), cute boys, the list goes on.  Call it the Faustian Orgy of Materialistic and Hollow Distractions.  But maybe it's not the big city.  Maybe it's home, and all the childhood ghosts that lurk in the corners of rooms that over the years have accumulated a whole lot of junk-- "junk" in both the physical and emotional/spiritual sense.  Physically, there is just a lot of stuff in my room and in the garage that is part of a general chaotic mess.....I can't sort through anything, I can't find anything that I need to find.  I don't quite feel at home because I am still living out of a suitcase for fear that if I begin to organize and settle down, the task will be too involved and never-ending.  To put it simply, there is no SPACE.  I feel claustrophobic in my house.  More abstractly, I find myself slipping back into roles that I played in my family and in friendships when I was young, that I thought I had grown out of.   These roles cramp...stifle...pigeonhole me.  They perpetuate negative reinforcements about my character and my abilities that I thought I had resolved and worked through.  But it almost feels like I have no choice but to give into them.  There is no SPACE for me to be who I have become away from home, because the majority of the people I know here have no idea how much I've changed in recent years.  Or how much I have changed even in this past year.  I mean, even  I  had no idea how much I'd changed until this summer; here, I keep running into the ghost of my old self, and I want to yell at her, "Go away!"  The sad effect of this phenomenon is a huge dearth of quality conversations.  Honestly, I think I've had like two all summer.  Somehow I can't get myself to share deeply about what is really important, partially because of my own vacuous frame of mind right now, and partially because it would take too much energy to catch the other person up with what has happened to me in the past six, or four, or two years.  Most conversations circle around the infamous FOMHD (see above paragraph for acronym), and it's really....sad.  I suppose it's a mixture of all these things, this funk.  The only "productive" thing I have been doing is getting ready for grad school apps-- researching schools, reading up on relevant material in the field, tackling logistics.  But it leaves me with an empty feeling when spiritually, I feel far from God, and this whole grad school thing is about Him.  On top of that, I haven't gotten to any of my other "projects," like studying my languages, writing poetry, and brainstorming for the courses I am teaching next semester.   A year and a half ago, when I was reading Jonathan Edwards'  Religious Affections , I was brought out of a serious depression as Edwards helped me meditate on the Beauty of God in His Holiness.  It forever changed how I would perceive God and what it means to love Him: Loving God for God's own sake, not loving God because of what He's done for me.  Loving God devoid of self-interest.  Dwelling on His character, then, and being swept away by who He is.  I think that I need to go through that book again, but, as expected, I can't seem to find it in this mess.

      There's something about being home that makes me spiritually sluggish.  I am trying to be more disciplined, but it's so hard when I have a zillion other things on my mind, like preparing for grad school apps, or getting ready for Eunice's wedding, or hanging out with people whom I haven't hung out with in a long time.  Yesterday morning I spent some time reading the Word and playing praises at the piano, and it was refreshing....I thought, why haven't I done this more since I've gotten back? Am I really too busy for God? That's ridiculous.  (hey slim! shoutouts aren't working, but yeah, I'm in LA. you're up north though right? I'll be here until 8/15 :))

      I took a lil quiz today that suggested what book in the Bible expresses who I am the most.  The results:    You are Psalms.    urlLink   Which book of the Bible are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Interesting.  I think that's about right on.  What about you?   hehe, I wonder if anyone ever gets...like, Zephaniah haha

      To my dear chicitas all over the world (Joyce in Korea, soon to be in Uzbek, Joanne in Australia, Ro in the middle of her five countries): sorry that I have been so delinquent in contributing to our blogger ring. ^^ Thank you so much for your sweet shout-outs.  I miss you girls dearly.  When I think of Korea, my chest cramps a bit missing Handong and you.  Honestly, I think that I have been avoiding updating.  That sometimes happens to me when I feel overwhelmed with things to share...  haha, but I am laughing at my last entry.  I used the word "substrate."  What a science-y word.  And "accrue" is oh-so-quantitative.  I was hanging out with all my science-y friends at the time: Esther the epidemiologist, Tina the biologist, Tamara the ecologist, and Carmen the physiologist.  kkk  They were my Stanford drawmmates, and I met them in my dorm sophomore year, when I was still "only" a Hum Bio major.  They were all in the Hum Bio core with me, save Tina, who opted instead to go straight Bio.  Anyway, they all stayed science-y, whereas I eventually made an insurgent about-face into what stanfordites call "fuzziness"-- the humanities. :) I'm fuzzy all over now, but I still love my drawies, and I am still interested in techieness believe it or not....when it comes up. ;) When I'm with these girls, and it is a normal thing while drinking coffee to speculate on why caffiene helps allergy symptoms, or have an innocent question like "Why is it that the enjoyment of anything can't last forever?" while suntanning on the beach turn into a spiel about stress endocrinology, I thoroughly and veritably enjoy myself (to be fair though, the latter thread did eventually turn theological ^^).  It's refreshing to see that side of life again.  It's like putting on a pair of yellow-tinted glasses that makes the whole world seem clearer and brighter...no joke! Miss you girls!  As for me,  I am still wide-eyed with being in the States again.  These past couple of weeks have begun a new journey into who I am with respect to my history, my heritage.  Little did I know that a year in the motherland would forever change the way I look at Koreans in America, and in particular how I see my family.  On the drive down to LA, I ended up trying to tell Tam about my father's amazing story of how his family fled from North to South Korea when he was a child, of his life as an orphan after his mother died when he was only 13 (his father had died just before he was born), and his eventual immigration to the States with my mother just before having my sister, their first child.  But when I tried, I was frustrated to find that there were huge gaps and cloudy details in the story....which makes sense, since when my dad first told it to me, the language barrier kept my memory of it hazy at best.  So I took the opportunity of our Fourth of July family reunion to get it right, now that my korean is vastly improved.  I had my dad tell me the story, and then I had my uncle, his elder brother, tell me his version.  It struck me as even more of a heart-wrenching and incredible story then I remembered.  My mother also took the occasion to tell me about my favorite aunt, who is actually my mom's cousin by blood and sister by adoption, and the depressing story of how and why her parents abandoned her as a child.  I still need to sit down and piece it all together in light of Korean history, since both stories are deeply entangled in the heated political situation at the time.    These stories, along with living in Korea and coming to understand how Koreans view America, have given me a new perspective on Koreans in America.  Driving through Koreatown with a friend the other day was very much a climactic experience for me.  All of a sudden it was clear why there was a place like Koreatown in LA at all, the kinds of dreams and motivations that brought thousands of Korean immigrants to a land where prestigious degrees became bunk and everyone had to start at ground zero. I also understand more clearly the misfortunes the expatriots were fleeing from even though, in this "Land of Gold" as they called it,  their muddled tongues could not produce the language of power.  Attending my church again, the biggest Korean church in all of California, possibly in all of the US, illumined for me more than ever the generational divide, and the role of the church in both reconciling and perpetuating it.  The differing ideologies buttressing these generational conflicts are clearer now as well, not to mention the penetrating impact of the language barrier.  Hybrid: I am a child of two lands, of two tongues.  My own life links two countries across the Pacific Ocean; in me east meets west, in me fiery independence mingles with an incorrigible communal identity, in me one country's history overlaps another's, an alloyed history self-embattled in many ways.    I've always wondered why my family has its yearly, very Korean reunion on Independence Day, arguably the most "American" of holidays.  Now I wonder how it could have ever been unclear: it's a celebration of the children, of the hybrids.  We are American, but they don't want us to forget that we are Korean.  I am a legacy of the American dream, but I am also a triumph of Korea.  What I mean by that can be distilled in something my uncle said to me at the reunion: "One day one of our future children will become the president of the United States.  A Korean, American president."  Ironically, or should I say perforce, he said this in korean.  That's his dream, and his sentiments do not differ much from the other first generationers.  Our successes not only bring prestige to our family-- they are also symbolic of redeeming and healing Korea's broken past.  I don't have time to do it right now at this point in my life, but it has become a secret wish of mine to eventually write a memoir or collection of short stories about my family history.  My uncle, who is functionally the patriarch of our family, since my paternal grandparents are dead and he is the oldest male known to be alive (an older brother might still be alive in North Korea), was thrilled that I showed interest in our family history.  He kept saying that it would take him days to sit down and say everything he wanted to say about it, but he told me that he would put me in touch with a distant relative in Korea who is a Chi and who has been piecing together the different historical threads of our family for most of his life.  I would love to go to North Korea someday and go to my father's hometown and research our ancestry.  It might already be too late...our familial memory is already quite elusive since my father and uncle left North Korea so early on in their lives, and haven't been back due to the hateful 38th parallel.  But when North Korea finally opens its borders to the world, I hope someday to go in.

      What a week! The first week of classes was quite a whirlwind, but I am really excited about the Reading and Discussion class that I am teaching.  I am excited about integrating worldview, faith, and maybe even philosophy into the discussions of literary pieces in their reader.  This is amazing, because I am actually training for the very kind of thing I will be doing as a comparative literature professor in the future.  I've only been teaching communication classes up until this point, so this is a most refreshing and appropriate change.  My goal this semester is not so much about making the classroom fun, as it is about making my students really think.  I want them to encounter their own culture with a new perspective by being confronted with a foreign one; I want them to engage in the process of discovering their own presuppositions, many of which they might not be aware.    But tomorrow morning I am off again to the States for Eunice's wedding.  It's crazy, because I am only going to be there for a day and a half before I have to fly back!  I am so happy to be able to witness one of my dearest friends get married though.  She is "the first to go" from my inner circle of girlfriends.  It's going to be very weird to see her plunge into marriagedom....

      I'm in Korea again and it feels soooooooooo good.  I didn't realize just how much I missed it until I landed in Incheon and the sound of Korean being spoken all around me made me feel all warm inside.  And then, that beautiful stretch on the narrow road through the rice fields just before reaching Handong, and the first glimpse of the Handong Global University sign....words can't do justice to the happiness those sights bring me.  Yesterday morning, my first morning back at Handong, I woke up at 5 am due to jet lag.  I couldn't go back to sleep, so I decided to take a walk.  Oh my goodness, when I walked outside, I was taken aback by the beauty before me.  The sky was a gorgeous dawn rose, the air balmy, the landscape lush and green.  There was not a single soul out, it seemed, and it was silent save for the chorus of chirping birds and crickets.  It was a pleasant, peaceful ramble, and by the end of it I felt like a new person.  I walked up the back steps of the church to the highest point in Handong, from where you can see a magnificent view of rice fields and woods and mountains, all the way out to the distant, still ocean.    I sat there and prayed like I haven't prayed in a really really long time.  And I repented.  I've been so sinful....not so much in outward action, but fatally so in my heart.  I haven't been a very nice person lately.  Just really self-focused.  Ok, self-centered.  I asked God to renew my passion for Him and to inspire me again with who HE IS.  I unknowingly was harboring and repressing several hidden fears, and they all surfaced violently like a volcano.  Fears about grad school, about friendship, about marriage, about missions, but at the center was the greatest fear of all: a fear of myself.  It was this terrifying suspicion that I was a counterfeit and a wimp, and that I would never follow through with living my life fully for Christ.  That I would just cop out and settle for living for myself instead.    I felt all ALONE and hopeless....and then God hit me with the simple yet profound truth: That's right, if it was just you, you wouldn't be able to do it, but  My grace is sufficient for you.....     With that, I left the bleak summer of apathy and defeat behind me.  It is yet another new beginning, and I feel like I am just learning for the first time the meaning of the word  trust .     I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

      Ok, so I gave in and joined Friendster at Jan's request. :) She is the only friend on my friends list right now, but as I tried to add some people that I know, I quickly found out that it takes forever! I think that I contacted like 5 people before I gave up.  So I thought that this way would be quicker: if you are reading this page, and you are on Friendster, and I know you, please add me! Hm....I wonder if  this will work.  Those I consider friends enough for Friendster: if I ever hung out with you and we had fun. :)

      Last night I had one of those weird moments when you, all of a sudden and for a fleeting moment, realize how dreamlike and ephemeral this life is.  I had the bedside lamp on, and I was reading Henri Nowen's  The Return of the Prodigal Son .  Something he wrote must have triggered the presentiment, but somehow in an instant I wasn't sure if I was dreaming or if I was real.  I laid the book down on my stomach, stared up at the blank ceiling, and felt slightly sick to the stomach.  My future flashed before my eyes and then I was dead.  Dead, that's it.  The question creeped into my head, what if this  is  all there is? My existence just a blip in time, meaningless, and therefore, hardly existent?  I remember the first time I had this feeling, and it was powerfully gripping.  I was in the 4th grade, and my family was taking a road trip/camping trip up the west coast.  We used to own a station wagon back then, and I was sitting alone in the backseat that faced out, toward the rear window.  The scene is still clear in my mind's eye: the sun was setting, and the sky was all ablaze with an eerie glow.  We were on a winding road, the kind that diminishes into the horizon, and the landscape of mountains and plains was breathtaking.  It was quiet in the car; I think my brother and sister were sleeping.  In that silence and beauty, I was compelled by the questions, "Is this real?"  "Am I real?"  "What happens when I die?" When I tried to imagine heaven, it terrified me.  The concept of living eternally, even if it were in a perfect place, shook me to my bones.  But when I reasoned that perhaps nothing was after this life, I felt immensely desolate inside.  I wept silently until I fell asleep, but I couldn't understand why I was crying.  Since then I have had other similar twinklings of existential panic, but none quite so intense and prolonged as that first time.  As I grew in Christ, I think, the truth of the matter quelled the fear too.  My concept of heaven and of God matured, and when I actually began to  desire  Christ, the metaphysical was no longer so frightful.  And of course, as my intellect matured, it became no longer  logically  viable that there could  not   be a transcendent, yet immanent, God in the universe.     But I still have those moments once in a long while, and I don't think that there is anything in this life that could be as deeply disturbing and lonely and depressing.  For some odd reason, I tried to hold onto that moment last night.  I really wanted to prolong it, and do some mental exercises with it.  But I couldn't.  As soon as I thought of Christ, the illusion disintegrated and the shining truth would not let me deceive myself for very long.    That was grace of course.  Oddly enough, I slept very well last night.

      This week seemed like a month.  It's Sunday night and the cycle starts all over again tomorrow.  Although, it'll be infinitely better this week since its festival time again, which means that I have Wednesday through Sunday off.  Jess and I are going to Jeju Island to relax for those precious few days.  I say "precious", because we have no vacation after that for the rest of the semester.  I have been overworking, so I am banning myself from bringing work along.  Sunbathing, leisure reading, and sightseeing, here I come!  This past week however, despite the busyness, was fulfilling.  I had some really great classes, had a reunion with one of my classes from last semester, and gave a major presentation for the Department of Language Ed on Wednesday.  I've never given such a professional presentation before, and it was quite stressful preparing for it, but in the end the hard work paid off.  Jessica and I presented on practical ways to integrate faith and language learning into the English Reading and Discussion course.  We went all the way, with a powerpoint presentation and diagrams and quotes and handouts and tagteaming.  I think what I liked most about it was organizing and synthesizing elements of my teaching experience that I am passionate about into a coherent and fluid unit of expression.  Our department responded warmly, and it looks like there will be a lot of dialogue about this subject in the future.  In my spare moments I have been working on my statement of purpose, and this weekend was pretty much dedicated to it.  I don't know how I feel about this whole process.  On the one hand, I find it strange to have to boast about myself, but on the other hand, I have been enjoying reflecting on the past few years of my life and how God has brought me to where I am today.  What I really need now is inspiration from God to give the ideas a dynamic structure and a force of eloquence that can only come from deep sincerity.  I'm not there yet.  I keep getting into this mode where I want to "sell" myself, but I don't think that's the best way.  I end up sounding gimmicky and affectedly intellectual.  I know that there must be a mode in which my passion could come through,  resplendently and profoundly honest.  I'm going to keep editing until I reach that epiphany.

      Today, reading my brother's  urlLink blog  , I realized that he has entered the same stage of life as me.  Weird.  The things he is thinking about are the things that have been weighing on my mind for some time now:  the desire to meet someone special, and settle down in marriage.....and yet the desire to do so many things before marriage, and take full advantage of the gift of singlehood by living uninhibitedly for God.  I have come to a place where I am now afraid of dating.  Someone asked me out on a date the other day, and I said no to him!  He is Korean-Korean, a real sweetheart, someone who loves the Lord.  And he couldn't have been more direct....no one has EVER been this direct with me so early on in our friendship (I've known him for only like 3 weeks):   "Would you go out with me?"     "On a date you mean?" "Yes! Of course." "Um...no...I'm sorry...I 'm not ready....I'm not interested...we can be friends but..."  I couldn't do it.  I had seen it coming actually, so it wasn't like he had taken me totally by surprise, except that he was so direct (very unKorean).  I respected his directness though.  It was very honest, and quite manly.  I prefer that to sneakiness.  But why the rejection?  Part of it was that I didn't feel any attraction whatsoever...I should say  yet  since I don't know him very well... part of it was a fear of doing something that has become quite unfamiliar to me...but the biggest part of it was the fact that I am now of "marriageable age" and any decision I make regarding guys seems to be infinitely weightier.  So I just freaked out I guess.  I mean, what harm could one date have done? Since we don't know each other very well, it would have just been a chance to talk and get to know each other, for better or for worse.  But I just couldn't.  I guess I fear dating because in my mind dating=marriage.  Now I know that that equation is quite silly, but I guess I can't help feeling it.  Case in point, my mother called me the other day and told me that all of a sudden people are asking her to set me up with their sons!  You KNOW those parents are thinking dating=marriage.  That weirded me out completely.  I said no to her, too.  I just want to live all-out for God, no-holds barred.  I guess a part of me thinks that a man would inhibit me in some way?  I truly wonder if it is possible that there could be someone out there who could love me, and whom I could love, and yet not distract me from God (past experiences of broken relationships can do that to you I guess).    Like John said, this special phase in life, in which I am both independent and single, is a gift from God.  But it is also such a confusing phase!!! Do women have it harder than men? For some reason, I think so.  Most guys are conditioned to think that the women they marry will just follow them in whatever they do.  So it seems that women have to be more careful of who WE choose.  Maybe I'm wrong.    Anyway, all I can say is that this is a very WEIRD stage in life.

      I read an interesting blog by a random person that I don't know on Danny's jack.html.  He was talking about "God's complete lack of empathy" and was claiming that "[God] cannot reason with man, nor can they achieve mutual understanding. Empathy between man and God is  impossible ." He goes on to talk about the implications of this as a believer, and that like God, empathy is "contrary to the nature of the believer" since it is often linked to the "communal toleration and glorification of what it is to be human--to sin."  This guy had a very compelling  urlLink argument , but I have to disagree completely.    I found a couple of contradictions in his argument.  First of all, if we are made in the image of God (which he does discuss earlier in a different context), then how could we not have empathy with God? The ways in which we bear resemblance to our Creator evince His COMMUNICABLE (a word that implies connection, empathy) attributes, like intelligence, love, creativity, happiness, etc.  Granted, there are aspects of God's character that the human mind can not grasp, such as His omniscience or eternality or timelessness, but this does not make Him completely inscrutable.  This person further contradicts himself in that, if humans can't have empathy  with  God, than how could believers be  like  God in His so-called lack of empathy?  The truth of the matter is actually quite glaring: JESUS IS THE EPITOME OF GOD'S EMPATHY WITH HUMANKIND.  He didn't sin, but He "was tempted in every way...":    Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted.  Hebrews 2:17-18   For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we areyet was without sin.  Hebrews 4:15  The blogger made the point that "empathy is the basis of [human] justice,"  but I would argue that if that's true,  divine  empathy is the basis of grace, and the kind of  holy  justice that mingles love, righteousness, and mercy.  If Christ's death and resurrection within us is not the supreme and most perfect example of empathy, then I don't know what is.  Now how does this look in the real world as a believer? I agree with the blogger that we must reject sin because it is contrary to the nature of regeneration to live in the flesh.  But that is not to say that we do not struggle with sin, and it is the very struggle with sin that allows us to understand and reach out to the unsaved in HUMILITY.  We don't condone sin, but we understand it, or else we wouldn't understand the profundity of grace.  The guy cites Paul as an example of one who lost the faculty of empathy once saved, but I beg to differ.  Paul sees his sin all the more clearly (Romans 7!!!), to the point of despair, but what could follow such a face-off with sin, except the glorious truth of Romans 8?     Those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?...Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?...For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.    Could there be anyone in the Bible who understood the love of God more than Paul?  Did not this deep understanding of God's love, and the godly empathy with humankind which such understanding produced, compel Paul to devote his life to reaching the world with the radical, life-changing truth that is the gospel?        The end of the gospel is not to eliminate sin, which I believe is the fulcrum of this guy's argument.  No, the end of the gospel is to bring unworthy people into an inconceivable  relationship   with a most holy and loving God, through Jesus, who is the quintessential expression of perfect, divine empathy.

      I was going to take the time today to reply to a bunch of emails that have been stacking up in my inbox, but my stanford account is temporarily closed for maintenance.  Sorry about that.  I'll write back to you all soon....blogging will have to do for now.  School is back in full swing and I feel like I barely have time to sit down and catch my breath.  My schedule is actually pretty light, with only two Reading and Discussion sections, one Public Speaking class, and 2 continuing ed classes which are not assessed or graded.  But I am still running around all over the place.  Hopefully things will settle down soon.  I really need to focus on grad school apps, and at this rate that's never going to happen.  I was supposed to get a bulk of grad school stuff done this week during the Chusok break, but I haven't been very successful.  Thursday was a Chusok potluck with all the foreign faculty, after which some of us played basketball in the rain.  Super fun and super wet.  Then we had a women's Bible study that night, and when I got home I went straight to bed.    Yesterday was also unproductive. Some of us went out for a yummy lunch at Tofu Village, then went to watch Pirates of the Caribbean at the brand new theater, after which we hurried home to spend the rest of the evening scared and in the dark because of the havoc the crazy typhoon was wreaking outside.  It was seriously crazy!  The wind was so strong that it actually shook our building all night.  I thought the roof was going to fly off.  Outside you could hear things breaking and flying against the buildings.  Jessica and I tried to distract ourselves by lighting candles (the electricity was out of course), and singing praise songs really loudly.  It worked pretty well.  By 1 am I was so tired that I actually somehow fell asleep, but Jess told me that she couldn't sleep until around 3:00, when the typhoon finally started winding down.  When I woke up this morning, I couldn't believe how sunny and beautiful it was.  It's almost like the night before had been a mere dream.  But when I went out for a walk, hard evidence of the typhoon was strewn all over the place.  Trees, baskteball hoop stands, trash cans, motorcycles, benches, you name it...everything had fallen to the ground.  Everywhere lay debris from the roof tops and buildings (the architecture on campus is obviously not very sturdy).  Huge panels from God knows where were in the most random places.  And when I got to the chapel, I found the front glass door shattered and in pieces.  Wow, what a sight.  Workmen have been out since morning cleaning up, and now the campus looks nearly normal again.    But walking around outside made me realize that I could have been in serious danger if I didn't have a place to go last night.  It's a blessing to have shelter, food to eat, and people who care about me.  It made me feel ashamed that I have been so caught up in my own preoccupation with getting into grad school that I failed to stop and appreciate the fact that God provides for me every single day of my life.  Here I was, disappointed in myself that I hadn't gotten more "done" this week, when really, I had "done" a lot.  I had spent good, quality time with people.  That's what's most important.  So even though I know that I still have a lot to do, I had a dose of proper perspective today.  I want to hold onto that, especially when I start getting stressed out again.

      It's been a long time.  School has been crazy busy, as it always is the first few weeks of the semester.  This week is Chusok week though, so I have a few days off to gather myself and focus on my statement of purpose for grad school.  The "things to do" list just never seems to approach completion.  I'll try to write a more thorough update later this week....

      What a good workout.  California Fitness in Apgujeongdong is niiiiiice.  I am super sore. In all the right places, though, so it feels good. :)    We saw a famous actor there with a hottie friend who is probably famous too.  Funny, I never know the names of these people, though I can recognize them.   They both walked right in front of me, and the hottie friend of the famous actor hovered around looking at the athletic shoes on display while I waited for John.  I got so nervous and self-conscious that I just pulled out my phone and pretended to be absorbed with it.  Haha, as if he would have tried to talk to me or something!  He did turn his head as he walked by when he heard us speaking in English though.  Maybe he was impressed. :)

      So I am sitting in John's brand new apartment in Seoul, using his brand spankin new laptop.  Gee, it sure seems tough being a hakwon teacher in Apgujeongdong.   He makes more money than me! My lil brother makes more money than me!  Life just isn't fair sometimes!  Anyway, he and Charles usually stay up until 3 or 4 am, but I'm already fading after a long long train ride.  Gonna sleep in John's brand new queen-sized bed, though, so that should be cool. ;)

      I wish that my blog entries were more lighthearted.  They are always so dang serious, aren't they? Guess that's my style? Let's see....was there anything funny that happened today?   Hm...nope, no. Nothin funny. Except funny grammatical mistakes in my classes, but I won't bore yall with those. hehe  Hm...if I can't write about anything funny, I'll settle with writing about the good ol' mundane....  I went hiking in Kyung Ju last Saturday with some friends, and it was really beautiful! The leaves are changing colors, and I noticed for the first time that the color schema of the Bulguksa temples match the colors of the surrounding trees at autumn.       What else? Well, I played basketball for three freakin hours on Sunday after lunch with a bunch of guys...we played three games.  I was incredibly sore on Monday.    Ro dyed her hair red! She looks soooooo sexy.  I finished the first complete draft of my statement! I was ecstatic, though I guess it's not a big deal.  My friends are reading it right now, but if anyone else would like to help me edit it, please write me a shoutout.  I'll send you the second draft.    My Korean tutor was laughing at me yesterday during our lesson.  I was reading my part of a dialogue out loud, and he kept chuckling over how stiff I sounded.  He kept showing me how to read it naturally, but it just made me so self-conscious that I was butchering syllables all over the place.  I was blushing like crazy.  Man, I'm going to practice that dialogue until I sound like a native-speaker, and boy, am I going to show HIM! ha!  From now on, I am going to try to notice the amusing things in life more.

      Check out the pictures of my trip to Jeju with Jess and Charles.  They're on Jess's  urlLink picture page .  Wow, it was just so gorgeous there! You'll notice that the weather was absolutely perfect....sunny, breezy, cloudless.  The two other older men (well, ok, ahjuhshees) you see in the pictures are Professor Ma and Reverend Yoon from Handong...we randomly ran into them on the plane, and ended up hanging out with them the whole time.  It was quite an unlikely group of people, really, but it was far more interesting that way.  We had some awesome conversations.

      crawling through a day is no way to live.  that's what i did today.  just crawled on through.  on all fours, tummy brushing the floor. really low. i blamed it on a headache but it was more than that. it was a crawling attitude. just get through the day just get through this hour just get through this one minute. staring at the ground is no way to live. i could have looked up at the striking autumn sky. but i didn't-- just noticed the light spit of rain when i walked out the door in the morning and the heavy spat of rain that lasted for 10 minutes at dinner time.  my roommate said that it was beautiful today.  "oh yes, isn't it?" was my flat reply.  but it did make me think.

      Inspired by a conversation with Jess and Joyce...   to dream...   to live is to dream.  a dream is hope and life  embracing with the strong arms  of passion. hope is wrapped up in the invisible life flows from beauty and truth and both are boundlessly real, relentlessly spiritual. so are dreams. dreams are real even before they become true. they grip us with the stuff of living that churns in our  guts, in our fists, in our teeth, in our thoughts, in our gaze, in our laughter, in our sighs, in our silence, in our words. dreams belong to the holy ether  too, spanning the distance of the divine and the mortal, a bridge for truth, a key into the image of something  beyond us,  yet in us. dreams persuade. dreams sustain. dreams ignite. dreams breathe meaning into us and out of us.  our dreams make us.

      I want to dance again.  I miss it.  I was talking to some friends the other day about the kind of performance dance I used to do, and it just made me sad again that I quit dancing after high school.  I have often felt sad about it, and I need to let this out once and for all, so here I go a-bloggin....  I had a traumatic audition experience for a performance arts college during my senior year in high school, and that's when it all stopped.  The audition was an absolute flop, and I lost all confidence after that.  I was convinced that I sucked and decided that if I wasn't going to be good, I wasn't going to try anymore.    Once I entered Stanford, I couldn't do much beyond a couple classes here and there, and even those classes made me nervous every single time.   The only type of dance I had done was "dance theater" (in the vein of Alvin Ailey, Ron Brown, and Dance Theater of Harlem), which in itself is a hybrid genre, on top of which my dance director choreographed in a very unique style that blended the traditional technique of ballet with the free movement and energy of modern and jazz.  Stanford however, neatly separated everything into discrete categories, none of which I felt comfortable or confident in.    Besides that, that traumatic audition had done something to my psychology that still affects me whenever I enter a dance studio.  I used to walk in excited and comfortable and confident, whereas now it takes everything in me to get myself to even attend a class, and once I do get there, my first impulse is to hide in the back and not talk to anyone.  It's really strange.  Of course, I didn't dare audition for any of the performance groups on campus.   So let's see, now it's been over 6 years since I last danced.  I mean,  really  danced.  And this is now one of my biggest regrets.  I can't express how much I miss preparing for a show, slowly adding music to steps, feeling the parts become a whole, dancing in thrilling interaction with other dancers, infusing my own soul into the movement as the choreography becomes second nature to my body.  See, it's not just dancing that I miss; I miss performing.  I miss the grueling training, I miss the high of  the night .   When I go home to LA, I still pull out videotapes of my high school performances and watch them alone in the living room.  I particularly like watching the dance concert of my senior year, because pathetically enough, it was the height of my short-lived dance career.  I can't fully explain what I feel when I watch that video.  A part of me marvels that that was me, that my body could actually move like that and do those things.  A part of me gets angry that I had been such a quitter.  And of course, a part of me gets depressed, because more than any of those other emotions,  all I want is to dance again .      I could start again, but already my dance muscles are a lot weaker, and my flexibility is nowhere near what it used to be.  I couldn't start again right now anyway, since I am in the mountains and half an hour away from the nearest dance studio.  But I was thinking, grad school might be the second chance.  I wonder if I could get past this stupid psychological wall though...I think that it is possible, since I've long since gotten over my terrible speech fright, and very recently (within the last year), my stage fright with singing in front of an audience.  I think this is the last "fright" I have to get over...

      Hahahaha, sometimes my brother surprises me with his sweetness.  Usually he just treats me like a guy, and sometimes I wonder if he even likes me. :) He grunts at me on the phone and forgets my birthday every year.  And then he goes and mentions me in  urlLink his blog  and I'm like, wow!     I was laughing so hard at the little bit about my dad calling all of us by one hybrid name.  Makes me miss home like you wouldn't believe.   I'm looking forward to seeing my brother again so soon. I just went to Seoul like three weekends ago, but I am going again this weekend for the SWING FESTIVAL....yippeeeeee!  Too bad for John that I am bringing like FOUR of my girlfriends! HA!  Oh and John, I thought that you had called me "sand" this whole time.  Didn't know you dropped the d.

      Oh God, I need to release, so I came here.  Grad app stuff again...  Berkeley has a specialist in modern Korean poetry who just started this fall! I had no idea! When I was researching schools this summer, Berkeley to my dismay had no Korean lit people, and so I had to cross it off my list.    And today, through a Cornell guy, I found out that a certain Jiwon Shin is there now. She is one of a handful of modern Korean poetry specialists in all of the continental US.  This is both good and bad news.  It's good news because I love Northern California and would love for a chance to go to Berkeley.  It's bad news because the application is due December 10th!  All of a sudden, there is SO much that I have to do, right away.  This is probably the only time I have regretted being on the other side of the Pacific.

      A beautiful winter day.  Not a cloud in the sky, the sun shining brilliantly.  Cold, crisp air.  Elegant leafless trees.  Frosty puddles that take you by surprise.      I am happy today.  I was walking down the hill from my apartment this afternoon, when all of a sudden I realized that I had this stupid grin on my face.  That struck me as unbelievably funny, which then made me laugh aloud!   This week was refreshing and fulfilling.  As I mentioned in the shout-out to James, the sermon last Sunday made me realize how self-centered I've been.  So this past week I have made a deliberate effort to pray more, and to pray more for  others .  Praying has been hard for me for awhile now, but it hit me how urgent it is to pray for the world and for the people in my life.  I also made time in my day to just worship God with my voice and my guitar, something that I used to do so regularly, not out of duty, but out of a sheer overflow from my heart.  Somehow I have lost that, and for the past few days I have tried to recapture the intangible unspeakable in my soul by focusing on who HE IS again.      And now I feel a quiet, fundamental difference.  But it happened all at once, unexpectedly, today.  Walking down that hill.  It's the feeling of changing the lens in an old pair of glasses...you don't quite realize how long you've been seeing things unclearly until you are able to see crystal clear again.  It was as if the video of my life had suddenly zoomed out, almost out-of-body-like, and for a brief moment I saw my life for what it is.  And, in the same astounding and breathtaking moment, I saw God for who HE IS.  An instant.  Gone.    But it was enough.  I feel strangely filled, and maybe I'm in love again.

      I'm a little disillusioned right now.  If you follow my page, you know by now that I want to study Comp lit with a focus on Korean poetry. However, since most Comp lit faculties don't have Koreanists, this means that I am going to have to find an advisor outside of the department.    So last week I emailed a UCLA Korean lit prof about the possibilty of working with him should I attend UCLA, attached my statement of purpose, and guess what he said?  He told me that he'd be happy to, as long as I fulfilled the same language requirements as the  Korean  majors. That would mean one year of classical Chinese and three years of Japanese!!!!! The thing is, because I would be a  Complit  major, I would also be studying Spanish, Korean, and a little French too! I don't think that this is possible....I am not sure if this guy realized what he was asking for...I mean, I was planning on studying some Chinese and Japanese anyway, as a background for Korean, but there's no way I could fit all those languages into two years.  So it makes me wonder, who would be my advisor if I attended UCLA? UCLA has a great Korean program, but there is only one Korean lit guy....  Or maybe I'd have to take a year (or two) off during the PhD program to study intensively in Korea...which means a grand total of 8 years in grad school...  Or maybe I should just go to grad school in Korea first, get a masters in Korean lit here, and then go to the States for a PhD in Comp Lit?  gggggrrrrr  The Harvard Korean lit prof was much more encouraging.  His email was warm, and he said that he would be "delighted to" work with me.  He seemed to like the fact that I would be a Koreanist with a  comparative approach.  But yeah right, he'd be "delighted to" work with me if I got IN to Harvard. HA.  That's my reach-school.  Hey, but it does help that I can now drop his name in my application.  Wow, if I got into Harvard, then I wouldn't have to worry about all of the above so much.    Or maybe I SHOULD get a strong background in classical Chinese and Japanese if I want to do quality work as a Koreanist in Comparative Literature.  Which takes me back to the extra two years in Korea thing. ugh.   I'll be an overeducated heptalingual old maid by the time I'm out of grad school.    Ok, I'm being melodramatic, I know.  It's been a long day.  I fell down the last three steps of the staircase on the way to class and badly butchered my shins.  And this, in front of a bunch of my students.  I felt like laughing and crying hysterically at the same time, but since a lot of people were surrounding me, I didn't do either.  I just smiled and whimpered a little and limped my way to the classroom.  Anyway, the prospect of grad school is really affecting my psyche, I think.  Last night I had a strange dream about it, and mind you, I rarely even remember my dreams.  I dreamt that I was in grad school, and that I was living in a dormitory with a bunch of random people who were supposedly my friends.  All white, for some reason, among whom two or three of the girls were quite ditzy and annoying.  And for some reason there were loaves and loaves of fresh homemade bread always available in the lounge.    Throughout the dream, I felt very detached, wandering around, observing people and things, not saying much. The dormitory had a small backyard, where the dining hall "chef" had his own garden of exotic vegetables and fruits.  The only time I remember speaking is when I asked the cook the names of the exotic vegetables (one being something called, "Belouse Pomegranate," which looked like a weird cross between a giant pear and an eggplant on the outside, with huge red pomegranate seeds on the inside).  The garden of vegetables and fruits in the back was the one thing that I was fascinated by: everything was large and mysterious, in shades of orange, green, purple, and red, mostly.  The people around me did not interest me in the least.    That's all I remember of the dream, but it seems significant for some reason.  Any interpretations?

      I just wrote an email to the woman who was my mentor teacher at Menlo School, where I was an intern my first year out of college.    She recently had a miscarriage.  Another  miscarriage.  She had her first miscarriage when I was working at Menlo, and I took over for her full-time for about two months while she was out recovering both physically and emotionally.    The last email I got from her was news that she was pregnant again.  She had sounded so hopeful, so happy.  Her doctor basically required that she stay in bed for nine months, just to be on the safe side the second time around.  I couldn't believe it when I heard that she had lost the second baby.  It was devastating, and I had not been able to write her right away.  But today, almost three months later, I finally sent the email.  I feel desolate inside.  I wrote that email feeling like there was nothing I could offer her, not even true sympathy, because doesn't true sympathy require some empathy? What do I know about what it feels like to lose a baby -- twice???  All I could offer her in all sincerity were my prayers.  And a poem.  I don't know why I felt like sending her the "to dream" poem, but I did.    I did write  Keep dreaming , which might end up seeming trite and like a non sequitur to her.  But in the moment, that was all I could come up with from the deepest part of my heart.  To me, the most tragic thing that could happen was not so much the loss of the child, but the loss of hope.  Life without hope is empty, and when I try to imagine the  emptiness  she must be feeling, I feel immensely sad.     Keep dreaming , what else could I say?

      woohoo! A 1000 word limit, and my essay is now EXACTLY at 1000 words! VICTORY! muahahahahahahahahahahaha  AGH! I am obsessed with my personal statement.  I can't stop fiddling with it.  I work on it before school, in between classes, after school, and I think about it constantly.  I have to STOP.  This is what I am turning in for the first app, which is due on December 1st.  This is it! No more fiddling.   Hehe, unless of course you write me a shout-out telling me that I should change something.^^    Honestly, I think that all I am looking for right now is affirmation though.  My friends have beat up my statement so much (constructively of course), and I've read it so many times now, that it's beginning to seem monumentally mediocre and boring!  Please tell me it's not.  Please tell me that I am going to get into grad school! :(  I know, I know, it's all in the Lord's hands.  IT'S ALL IN THE LORD'S HANDS.     __________________________________ I was an avid reader of my older sisters bookshelf throughout my youth.  By high school, I was reading Fyodor Dostoyevskys  Crime and Punishment , Leo Tolstoys  Anna Karenina , Ayn Rands  The Fountainhead , and the  Holy Bible  for leisure, outside of any school curriculum.  Through such books, I began thinking about the intricate relationships between literature, religion, politics, social mores, and philosophy.  What has always intrigued me about the written word is its power to ignite the imagination, and to allow the mind to experience phenomena beyond the corporeal limitations of its physical surroundings.  The process epitomizes the phenomenon of the connective human experience.    At Stanford University, this fascination with the human experience led me to major in Human Biology, an interdisciplinary field that integrates the sciences and social sciences concerning humans.  For the first three years of my undergraduate education, I studied subjects ranging from biology to psychology to sociology to ethics, with a concentration in anthropology.  These disciplines allowed me to explore a broad intellectual landscape spanning sundry modes of critical thought.  However, after three years of detached objectivity, I longed to explore the face-to-face encounter with human truth that I experienced in reading while growing up, and so began my first academic steps into the realm of literature.    I chose to study English Literature exclusively during my last year at Stanford.  While this complete about-face was one of the greatest intellectual challenges I had ever confronted, it was the best academic decision I had ever made.  Though I enjoyed and learned much in my Human Biology classes, I relished and thrived in the 11 English classes I completed in my senior year and its adjoining summers. Never had I excelled so much; never had I felt so passionate about my studies.  My intellectual journey came to full fruition as I moved from studying human biology, to studying human intra-action (e.g. psychology) and interaction (e.g. sociology, anthropology, etc.), to studying the creative powers of human thought in literature.         Through my teaching experiences at Menlo School in California and Handong Global University in South Korea, I have discovered that teaching is the place where my intellectual passion and my love of human interaction merge in a most invigorating way.  At Handong, my favorite course is  English Reading and Discussion , in which students read literary pieces by essayists and short story writers like Farley Mowat and Edgar Allen Poe.  This course has been the perfect grounds for formulating my personal thoughts on literature and culture, as well as for honing teaching skills specific to the comparative literature classroom.  My students are reading literary works in another languageexactly what I will be doing in graduate school.  Moreover, as their teacher, I have been developing pedagogical methods that focus on how cultures can encounter one another in the classroom, with literature as the vehicle.  When exploring graduate school options, it became clear that studying Comparative Literature would be the organic outcome of my experiences.  The idea that the written word can alter individual lives, affect ones identity, and perhaps even shape national consciousness is fascinating to me.  However, studying only one national literature would offer too narrow a perspective on such themes.  Studying several national literatures would give me more freedom to explore interdisciplinary angles.   My current interests for graduate study focus on Korean poetry in relation to the representation of nature in British Romanticism and Latin-American modern poetry.  The ancient Korean philosopher, Po-U, taught that nature is an extension of the soul, while Yi-Ih taught that the reason for reading is to put into practice what one had learned.  I am interested in looking at the combination of these ideas as a possible framework for the poetry that would deal with the horrors and sorrows of imperialism, war, and national division centuries later.  Like Romanticism, Korean poetry about nature often suggests a radical political subtext.  Chon Sang-Byung, for example, depicts a landscape that seems to transcend history, producing an effect that liberates historys destructive aspect into an imaginative sense of future.      In addition, the Korean we ubiquitously woven throughout the poetry seems to encapsulate the collective memory of a cruel historical reality and provides a rich perspective that I would like to investigate.  Starting with the Japanese occupation, in which the Korean language was anathema to Japanese imperialism, the very act of writing in the Korean language became an act of defiance and expression of hope.  Many patriots expressed themselves in literary creation.  The trends of this literature have yet to be analyzed sufficiently to link its spirit with the spirit of social and political movements.  Ko-Uns poetry has a wealth of riches to uncover along the themes of political resistance and collective memory.    It would be fascinating to look at such Korean themes alongside Latin-American poetry.  Latin-American consciousness also has been deeply affected by the cruelty of a colonial history.  In Pablo Nerudas  The Heights of Machu Picchu  ( Las Alturas de Machu Picchu ), the poets self-identification with a past people, the Incas, demands the finding of a historically resonant and indestructible place.  Indeed, Nerudas  Canto General , the larger work encompassing  The Heights of Machu Picchu , begins by conflating human history and natural landscape. Such imagery suggests that culture lives on as nature, an idea resonant with the ancient Korean idea of nature as an extension of the soul.  My professional aspirations include becoming an inspiring teacher of literature at the university level, publishing as a thoughtful and compelling literary critic, and disseminating the long-neglected literature of Korea as an innovative and culturally astute translator.  With all that is happening in current events, the country of Korea is squarely on the world map.  A page is turning in history, and the global community needs more than ever an understanding between the East and the West.  As a bicultural Korean-American, I am cognizant that east meets west within me.  My knowledge of Korean, Spanish, French, and Latin only enhances the unique perspective that I can offer to academia.

      Spent the whole day with appa.  Sure, we were running around all over LA doing errands, but that's what we always do.  I love it.    First he took me to eat sushi at the K-town Galleria.  While we were eating, he described the benefits of alkaline foods in balancing nutrition, and why our new alkaline water dispenser at home is going to do wonders for our health. He's a chemist, you see.  Later I brought up North Korea...because he's also a North Korean.  It was just so easy to talk to him.  I asked him how he would feel if NK opened up, and then asked him how he would feel if I eventually went there to teach. He didn't even blink an eye. If I went there, I'd set up churches, he stated.  I replied, if I went there I'd set up churches too, appa, but my vocation and my degree are what would get me in easily.  He thought about that for a moment, and nodded his head in agreement.  I love my dad.   Then we went to Dongdaemun, AKA Olympic Swapmeet, then to Costco, then to Sears, then to my mom's drycleaners, then to the video store, then to the Korean supermarket, and finally came home.  I was pooped.  Two incidents touched me today.  As we were walking through the Costco parking lot, I linked arms with him and said, Appa, don't you miss me when I am in Korea?  Again, he didn't even blink an eye, and slowly said,  Yes...I....do . It was the way he said it; I almost teared up.  But instead of crying, I joked with him and asked why he never talked to me on the phone then.  Because when you call you want to talk to umma, he replied.  No appa, I want to talk to you too.  This time it was his thoughtful silence that almost brought tears to my eyes.    The other moment was at Sears.  As we were paying for a vaccuum belt replacement at the register, I noticed something when my dad opened his wallet.  There was a teeny picture of me, which I had taken half-jokingly on my little niece's sticky-pic camera on New Year's two years ago.  I had given it to my dad laughingly then; little did I know that he kept it so close to himself all this time.      My dad's special.  I am still coming to grips with what an outstanding person he is.  Orphaned as a child in a war-torn country, separated from his place of birth and four brothers by the 38th parallel, poor and hungry for most of his youth, he worked with an indomitable Confucian work ethic, putting himself through university and getting himself a good job in Seoul, where he met my mother.  Eventually they made their way to Mi-gook (The Beautiful Country), where my father had to start from scratch.  His first job was in janitorial work.  Three decades later, he enjoys working as a senior chemist for the City of Los Angeles.  Here in the Land of Opportunity, our parents have managed to carve out a bright little existence for all of us.    My dad is a man of very few words, but not in the traditional authoritorian manner.  He is gentle, unassuming, humble, and generous.  He loves the Lord more than anything else in this world. Appa always enters my mind's eye whenever I read the verse, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."  Here's something my brother wrote about my dad in August 2002. I love this entry:   You see, my father was part of the wealthy Ji family in North Korea. he tells me stories of his rich childhood, of how wealthy he remembers his family was, of the box of jewels his mother had to hide from the North Korean soldiers (jewels they would later use to purchase a house in war torn Seoul)... of how his grandparents tried to fight back the troops who came to take away my father's land... of how he, along with his brothers and his mother, were forced to flee to South Korea due to religious persecution... of how he had to survive after all his brothers (save one) and mother died by the time he turned 12.   sigh.  my father's life story is the most amazing story of anyone that i know who is alive.   its amazing how much history shapes who we are. sometimes i think.... man, i most likely would not have been born unless Kim Il Sung came to power in North Korea. If the United States did not win World War II or if the Soviet Union never intervened in the latter stages of the war in the Pacific, then Korea most likely would never have been partitioned by the two superpowers. Korea would have never been divided. My father would never have been exiled from his country, he would have never met my mother, and ultimately, i would never have been born.  i think God works through history in such crazy insane ways. did you know that if you look at the Bible, God uses someone powerfully through each empire? here are some examples: Abraham in the civilization of Mesopotamia, Moses in the empire of Egypt, Queen Esther of Xerxes' Persia, Ezra in the time of Cyrus of Persia, Daniel in the kingdom of Babylon, Isaiah in the kingdom of Assyria, Jesus in the empire of Rome. Its craziness to just fathom the way God has been using people (not to mention his own Son) throughout the course of history....  which brings me back to my original point. God uses people to change the world. ordinary everyday people who are obedient and who love Him.   i believe that there is a reason why i come from a Christian background that expelled my father's family from his land, a reason why my father met my mother in South Korea, and a reason why they came over to America-- ultimately, a reason why i live.   i live to be a testimony of grace through Jesus Christ -- living proof that God works in mysterious and wonderful ways.   and when it all comes down to it, i live to glorify the God whom my father introduced me to.   so to my loving appa~  thank you for showing me what it means to love God and obey Him. there is nothing more precious i can learn in life than what you have already taught me with your wise words and shown me through you constant actions.   amen to that brotha.

      We went to a restaurant by the ocean today. Oh, it was gorgeous.  I sat right next to the window, and had a silent moment to myself when the sun went down, glimmering and watery and sad, at exactly 4:55.  I think the most special moment of a sunset, though, is after the sun has sunken just below the horizon, leaving the sky with a mysterious glow without the source of its light in sight.  There's something so melancholy and tender about it-- I think it has to do with being in the presence of absence.    Right then, I jumped up and ran outside for a brief stroll before it became completely dark.  I like watching the fleeting and gentle metamorphosis of a sky at dusk. And to breathe in that ocean air...it reminded me of home.   The ocean has changed symbolically for me over the years.  I remember having this discussion with Jan when we lived in SF; she had grown up on the beach, so the ocean had always reminded her of her home in Palos Verdes.  For me, having grown up inland, the ocean had always reminded me of the vast world out there and how much I didn't know or hadn't experienced.    Now that I live by the ocean in Pohang, it has come to remind me of heaven.  Perhaps it's strange, but I marvel at feeling overwhelmingly insignificant when the wind is thrashing and the waves are crashing mightily. I revel in feeling so tiny when a magnificent calm sweeps over the ocean and the horizon seems to stretch on forever and just the sheer volume of water blows my mind.  It helps me understand who I am, and who my Creator is; it helps me get in touch with how desperately I want to be with Him.      It has also come to remind me of love.  That someone is my soulmate, and that he is living and breathing somewhere right now.  Neruda's poem,  Here I Love You  explains it all by the sea.  And today, the ocean reminded me of Pohang.  In many ways Pohang is more like home to me than LA, because Pohang is where my life is; it's where I feel aligned with my passion and purpose for now.    What is home after all? Home is not a place; it's people, it's life, it's warmth.  I realize now that my view of the ocean was not essentially different from Jan's.  Home to me is all those things: the world, heaven, love, Pohang.  Pohang is home because it is where I am now, and I love it because it's the place where God has first merged my passions and shown me what it means to live life to the fullest.  The whole world is my home because it is my arena; I want to go out there and see and experience and love new places and people.  And love, love will be the feeling of home when I am one with the one I love.  But heaven is my real home, where my citizenship ultimately lies, and where the lonely, gaping hole in my soul finally will be absolutely satisfied.  I want to go home.

      My korean skills are going down the drain.  I better start practicing with my parents.  It's so easy just to speak English with them. Plus, my mother is constantly correcting my grammar or my pronunciation if I try to speak with her; it's annoying. :) I got her back yesterday though.  She said mehn-doo-ruh, instead of mahn-dooruh.  I kidded her about her country dialect and for teaching me improper korean all my life. hehe    I guess I should be studying languages but I'd much rather be reading books when I am at leisure. I did finish the Little Prince in Korean though.  That was good. If only I was good enough in French to read it in French without looking up every other word.

      Wow, I won't have time to do even half of the things I had wanted to do in LA.  At breakfast yesterday morning, my mom says to me, "Why don't you go visit your sister in D.C. before she leaves in June?"   I'm like, "Are you serious? I have no money umma; I'm going to Costa Rica, remember?"  She quickly offers to pay for the plane ticket as my birthday/Christmas present, leaving me wide-eyed.    My first impulse was to say, no way, I'll be too tired from traveling so much. But then, after a moment's thought, it suddenly seemed like a good idea.  I mean, I'm completely done with apps, so there's nothing hanging over my head.  I haven't been east in ages, and I would love to check out where my cool sister works (she works with the FBI). I could go see Carm in Maryland.  I could see Harold preach in Virginia and finally meet his wife and newborn baby.  So after scouring the internet for flight deals, I bought the ticket tonight. I'm going! Crazy, isn't it?  My sister was sitting in my room as I was confirming the purchase, and I said,"I can't believe I am doing this." I don't know, as I motioned to click the "purchase this flight" button, I felt all giddy about being so spontaneous, about totally changing my plans in one day.  I had been so completely  un -spontaneous and  super -responsible since June because of grad school stuff, that doing this was like a breath of release.  It hit me, I can do  whatever I want !  For now, I don't have any responsibilities or deadlines looming in the horizon, and it feels GOOD.  Life is good. Wish me fun.  Another highlight: I'll still get to eat prime rib before going back to Korea.  Mon's taking me to a Ruth Chris's by her place! yummmmyum.

      I took my family to the movies tonight.  Pre-bought tickets and everything.  Merry Christmas, I said. ^^    Cold Mountain.  It was a gorgeous movie, to say the least.  I would talk about it more, except that I don't want to spoil it for anyone...but I could swear that the story, adapted from a book by Charles Frazier, is based loosely around Homer's Odyssey.  The scale is definitely epic, the themes touching upon universals woven throughout humanity.  Actually, just last night I read James Joyce's short story again,  The Dead , and I think that it shaded the way I saw the movie.  I fell asleep last night with the beautiful final image reverberating in my mind,      ...It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight.  The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland.  It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried.  It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns.  His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.     Both the movie and Joyce's story tug at this feeling of... vacancy , immense vacancy...at the specter of death, in the contours of unconsummated love.  Both stories unearth and expose the fragmentary nature of relationships, and the faith required to trust in the unknowable-- the transcendent-- that characterizes all forms of love.  Taken to its spiritual core, this of course resonates with the story of mankind, and God's love.  I read some reviews that said that Ada and Inman's love for each other doesn't seem convincing; I am convinced that that's Hollywood's conditioning for easy sex and complex infatuations.  There is something about their love that strikes me as pure and passionate at the same time.  Pure  and  passionate.  I'm still reeling from the ending.

      AAAAGH! I am all set.  Going to Samara Beach in Costa Rica for a language program, Jan. 10 to Feb. 8.  The trip altogether costs less than 2 grand, so I think that I got a good deal.  The best thing about the program: daily latin dance classes included in the tuition! It can't get any better than that. ;)    As for outreach/missions programs in L. America, when I was researching I found out that it's too late to apply.  They all require apps two months in advance, but two months ago I was in the thick of grad apps.  There was no way.  I am sad about it, because it seems like I won't have the chance to go on any mission trips in the near future.  But then again, Allen said something last night that made my calling seem so real: I have a lifetime ahead of me.  True, true.  He also said that being in Korea is something like missions, at least in giving me a taste of what it's like to live overseas, doing God's work, for an extended period of time.  That's true too.      Still, maybe I can go somewhere next summer....although, I have to do a korean language program before entering grad school.  And I am going to Thailand with Inna.  Oh oh oh where are my priorities! :)   Well, Merry Christmas everyone!

      Great prayer meeting today.  Not many people came after all, but that's ok. It was still enlightening as to what is going on in NK and how I can pray.  New idea: start a NK prayer group next semester.  Surprisingly enough, I don't know of any groups praying for NK at Handong.  But I am realizing that, in general, the Korean-American community seems much more aware of what is going on in NK than the South Korean community.  There could be several theories as to why this is so, but my suspicion is that a part of it has to do with SK's old Sunshine Policy. It has trivialized the issue to one of "peaceful" (passive) relations=eventual unification.  It's a paradox, really.  In the name of "One Korea," depictions of NK seem to have been uniformly softened to accomodate feelings of friendliness.  I have noticed that discussion of NK's human rights atrocities is oddly absent in SK media.  Rather than actually leading to reunification, years of this policy's inculcation on SK society has resulted in general apathy toward any form of real action.    If you ask most university students about reunification, they will answer that SK is not ready for it! This is a generation of young people who did not experience the war, who have never met any NKans.  For them, all they see within purview of reunification is the certainty of economic decline and political instability.  They'd much rather be passionate in their anti-Americanism; the patriotic call for "One Korea" is more often than not a veiled epithet against American intervention than it is an outcry against the injustices of the North Korean administration.  It is a sad state of affairs.    Anyways, as I was praying today, I noticed something different about myself.  I am at a special place in my life right now where, if God called me to go to NK, it wouldn't be difficult for me to say yes.  That struck me as surprising for some reason.  I found myself sincerely praying, "Is that where you want me to go, Lord? I'll go."  I know that I have quite a few years ahead of me, since I have to finish grad school first, but I hope that I don't lose this flexibility--this willingness-- in that time period.  It's one of my GREATEST fears about grad school...that somewhere along the way I'll forget, or outright reject, the reason I wanted to get the degree in the first place.  Part of it has to do with being single, I know.  It would be different if I were dating because then I'd have to consider  his  experiences,  his  gifts,  his  options,  his  inclinations.  I remember how hard it was for me to make any decisions when I was dating in college, because I was so darn serious about a guy whose life ambitions ultimately ended up being too different from my own.         Despite my recent entries, I actually thoroughly enjoy being single.  Sometimes I feel like I could live like this forever-- really.  And then I get hit with a memory of what it was like to be loved, and to love someone deeply, and then I think,  I could do that again.  It'd be so beautiful.   But, most of the time, I am just thankful that my singleness lends me so much mobility to travel and do everything I've always wanted to do.  And it focuses me, like today.  It was just so clear: if God calls me to go, I'll go.  That's it.  What's there to consider?   I am not saying that God called me to NK tonight. No, no, I really don't know that yet.  But I am definitely interested enough to start researching ministry options and to start that prayer group next semester.  One step at a time, and the important thing to nurture is this willingness.  Willingness to go wherever.

      OH OH OH! I am so excited.  Just got an email that there is going to be a big North Korea prayer gathering at Young Nak THIS Sunday! Perfect timing.  Hope to see some of you there!  Here's the info:  Young Nak Church in Los Angeles, Celebration Chapel  Sunday, 12/21, 3-5 pm  Check out www.ynem.org for directions  BTW, in other related exciting news, Handong is launching a joint project with Yanbian University in China to set up the second university in all of North Korea (the only university that exists there at the moment is Kim Il Sung University).  It has been approved, and three professors from my department will be going to teach there NEXT YEAR...AND, they are going to continue sending willing professors from our department there on a semesterly rotation.  Can you believe it? I wish I could go.  Maybe after grad school.

      Leaving for LA tomorrow morning! I am way more excited this time than I was in June.    For one thing, none of my college friends were around in the summer...they were all working in different places. But everyone seems to be coming home for Christmas, so I'll be seeing friends that I haven't seen in a long time.   Also, last winter was a bummer because I spent Christmas and New Year's doing almost nothing in Seoul.  These holidays are just not the same in Korea.  I am looking forward to spending them this year with the family!  Umma has been really sweet lately and I think that she misses me a lot, even though she would never say it.    Some things I am looking forward to doing, in no particular order:  1) going out for cocktails and clubbing with Inna, hopefully more than once ^^ 2) going swinging at the Derby with Jan 3) going to the Ghetty and the Norton Simon by myself 4) eating Mexican food, Thai food, prime rib, and salads salads salads (they pickle everything in Korea, which is fine, but sometimes I just crave a fresh salad with all the fixins) with my YN girlfriends. 5) assembling what I can of the old "SF Monday Crew" (Al, Susan, Alice, Mateo...Munch? Ifang we'll miss ya) and doing something crazy fun in LA     6) visiting Eunice and her new hubby in their new home 7) playing our piano at home 8) seeing my relatives, marveling over how much my nieces and nephews have grown, and asking kuhn-ah-buh-jhee again about North Korea. 9) going to Borders and buying all the books that I've been wanting to read 10) getting involved at Young Nak somehow 11) going to Costco with appa on a father-daughter run and eating our customary fill of aisle samples  12) cooking a korean meal for my parents (didn't do this last time, but I want to do it this time) 13) watching korean dramas with umma 14) seeing my sister and going to a hot springs resort with the fam (we'll miss ya John). 15) chatting for hours with my lovely drawmmates, Esther, Tina, and Tam. 16) catching up with whoever else is in town.  CALL ME!   Hmm....there is probably more that I want to do, but the list is beginning to overwhelm me.  I only have about three weeks at home before I take off for Latin America!  The nice thing is that, now that I am done with applications (OHMYGOSHAMIREALLYREALLYDONEYESIAM!!!!!!!), I will have some genuine, carefree, FREE TIME.  Ok, I'm procrastinating though.  I've gotta finish these translations first!

      I am taking a break from translation.  Actually, I'll probably be going home soon since it's so late.  I think that I am going to have to call umma in the morn to fill in the gaps.  Song translation is fun.  It resembles what I will be doing in the future, when I translate Korean poetry.  This project is interesting because it not only involves the translation of lyrics from Korean to English, but also the adaptation of the translation to the original music while remaining faithful to the natural cadences of English.  In fact, song translation is perhaps even more rigorous in the sense that I must adhere to a strict musical score.      I am learning some Korean biblical language and Christianese, which I hope to put to use somehow later.   Anyways, just thought I'd post.  Felt lonely all of a sudden, sitting here late at night in the office. For some reason writing here to you guys makes me feel better.  Now I have to walk home in the freezing cold.  nite.

      Wow. Saddam looks so pathetic.  CNN images reveal just how human he is, more than anything.  Humiliated and broken, isn't that a picture of all of us to some extent?  What confounds me is that human nature can get  that  bad...which means that  I  could have been just as capable of such evil.  Man, this is when you know that everyone needs a savior.  Could God save Saddam? I believe so....if someone shared the story of Jesus with him right now...would it make a difference? Who knows.

      OK, poetry overload, sorry.  But now that school's over and the pace of life noticeably slower, I've found leisure to read again.  Last night I went through all my favorite poetry books.  And this one especially jumped out at me with new meaning:   Here I Love You  by Pablo Neruda  Here I love you. In the dark pines the wind disentangles itself. The moon glows like phosphorous on the vagrant waters. Days, all one kind, go chasing each other.  The snow unfurls in dancing figures. A silver gull slips down from the west. Sometimes a sail.  High, high stars.  Oh the black cross of a ship. Alone. Sometimes I get up early and even my soul is wet. Far away the sea sounds and resounds. This is a port. Here I love you.  Here I love you and the horizon hides you in vain. I love you still among these cold things. Sometimes my kisses go on those heavy vessels that cross the sea towards no arrival. I see myself forgotten like those old anchors. The piers sadden when the afternoon moors there. My life grows tired, hungry to no purpose. I love what I do not have. You are so far. My loathing wrestles with the slow twilights. But night comes and starts to sing to me.  The moon turns its clockwork dream. The biggest stars look at me with your eyes. And as I love you, the pines in the wind want to sing your name with their leaves of wire.    I bought  Pablo Neruda's Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair  last winter, when I was in Madrid, and this poem had such a different meaning for me then.  I had believed myself to be in love, and this poem resonated with the part of me that missed him.  Nothing ever came of that one-sided episode, but a year later, the poem has an entirely different, more precise meaning.  I live in the mountains by the ocean, so the setting for this poem is uncannily accurate.  Pines, wind, high stars, a port, the sea.  The "you" at this point is unknown to me, but I do believe that I love him already since he actually does exist right at this moment...and God has chosen him for me.  Being in Korea, the "you" in this poem seems far far away.  Only the stars and the pines in the wind seem to know his name.   Having turned 25 just a few days ago, I've been praying more about my husband...and I feel a special kind of loneliness.  It's not a depressing, pathetic kind of loneliness.  It's just the kind that makes my heart stretch, the kind that colors everything with poetry.  Call me a romantic, but don't call me hopeless.

       Heir to All  by Li-Young Lee  What I spill in a dream runs under my door, ahead of my arrival and the year's wide round,  to meet me in the color of hills at dawn, or else collected  in a flower's name I trace with my finger  in a book.  Proving  only this: Listening is the ground below my sleep, where decision is born, and  whoever's heard the title autumn knows him by is heir to all those unfurnished rooms inside the roses.

      What a good week.  Thanks everyone for the sweet messages and prayers.    I spent my birthday at a really nice jjheemjjheel bang (Korean-style sauna and bathhouse) with one of my adult students and his wife.  Su and his wife are both older than my parents, and have only one son, so they treat me like a daughter.  Lucky me. :)  The jjheemjjheel bang was better than most-- the gardening was charming and the views from the windows overlooked the Korean winter landscape of rice fields and mountains.  It was superb relaxation.  I released all the stress of the entire semester in those few hours of detoxification: reflecting on life as I sweated out all the poison, scrubbing scrubbing scrubbing with vigor until I was sparkling fresh and new, and finally dipping into a fountain of fancy vitamin-and-mineral-treated water that seemed to infuse me with fresh verve.    In the evening I had dinner with one of my undergrad classes from last semester; it was good to see them again, to see how much they've matured over just one semester.  They made me a cake out of cookies and yogurt and gummy bears, which was kind of gross, but hey, it was touching.  After that, four of us climbed up to the lighthouse at Sunrise Park, where we sang some Christmas carols.  Then we headed to a cozy little restaurant by the brilliantly moonlit beach, and talked for hours about life.  I've never heard Korean university students speak that deeply, maybe because most of the time they are limited by English.  But that night we freely joked and talked in Korean, and I saw a completely different side to them.  It was a poignant moment for me to be part of a deep and meaningful conversation in another language.  There was a space of time in which I stayed quiet while they were heatedly talking about something, just to soak it in.  God was giving me a glimpse into the future.  I had been a little sad that day that I wasn't going to be hanging out with any of my good friends, but it turned out to be good...maybe even better.  I only say that because while I spent the entire day with people, it seemed more like a day by myself.  And I needed that.  Sometimes God gifts us with times for quiet observation, reflection, ablution.  Unexpectedly that was what my 25th birthday turned out to be.

      25...that sounds strangely weighty.  Maybe that's because in math class we always rounded up.  25 seems closer to 30, while 24 seems closer to 20.  25 is half of 50.  A quarter of 100.    A quarter of a century.  Have I really lived that long?  Can I say that I've done all that I had wanted to do by 25?  Surprisingly, yes.  But that's because I had no idea what I wanted for my life until three years ago.  Almost exactly three years ago, I went to Urbana little knowing that it would forever change my life trajectory.  Life is so different when you have a dream.    So let's see.  Let's start there.  In those three years, I graduated from college, broke up with someone whom I had thought I would marry, worked as a teacher at a California high school for a year, and moved out to Korea to teach at a university for two years. Along the way, I've said goodbye to and have met some spectacular people who've inspired me to live life to the fullest.  I'd say that I don't regret one thing about the past three years.        I'm looking ahead to the next 25 years though.  There is now much that I would like to accomplish in that time: - Finish grad school and be well-equipped for overseas ministry. - Become fully trilingual (I have a long way to go, but hey, I have 25 years, right?!), if not quadralingual (depending on the country God leads me to), with an adequate knowledge of French and Latin in addition. - Go overseas as a tentmaker. - Publish articles/books that point to Truth, redeeming in at least a small way ideas that have been corrupted by the world, and trusting my Christian worldview to help me see art, beauty, philosophy, and humanity more clearly.  - Continue to develop pedagogical methods that somehow reveal the image of God in man, and man's need for God, in my teaching of literature.  This will most likely have to be an indirect approach that prods students to think about their own presuppositions and values and worldview, in which a relational follow-up would open doors for me to share the gospel on a personal level, outside the classroom. - Marry an awesome man who thinks integratively and artistically and who loves the Lord, and have a few babies. :) - Love people and see them come to know and love the Lord.  By the time I am 50, I want to be able to look back and say, "Christ Jesus has been and is and always will be the LORD of my life."  What is important in this life?  I love the verse in Psalm 42:    Deep calls unto deep at the noise of Your waterfalls; all your waves and billows have gone over me.     That to me crystallizes what life is about.  The hollow depths of man calling out to the ineffable and beautiful depths of God.  God longing to fill the depth of man's emptiness with the depth of His perfect love.  The "noise of [His] waterfalls" is the abundance of evidence of Him in all the world; "[His] waves and billows [going] over me" is the overwhelming and breathtaking nature of His bewildering grace.    The material world is only the backdrop for a spiritual reality.  The spirit world is what will remain when all else passes away, so that's what I want live for.    Happy birthday to me!   Nevertheless I am continually with You;  You hold me by my right hand.  You will guide me with Your counsel,  And afterward receive me to glory.   Whom have I in heaven but You?  And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You.  My flesh and my heart fail;  But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.   For indeed, those who are far from You shall perish;  You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry.  But it is good for me to draw near to God;  I have put my trust in the Lord GOD,  That I may declare all Your works.   Psalm 73:23-28

      Sunday was the last Handong English Ministry service for the semester.  I love this church.  I am going to miss it over the break.  The praise team is so international....students from Africa, Indonesia, South America, Thailand, Uzbekistan, China, Fiji...I joined the team halfway through the semester, and every time I meet them I am reminded of the vast world out there that I have yet to explore.  So here are my plans for the winter:   - Fly home on the 20th - Stay in LA until January 10th or so, get involved with outreach programs at Young Nak - Go to Latin America for a language/outreach program - Come back to LA by February 10, fly out on the 14th  I can't believe I'll be home again so soon.  I spent Christmas and New Year's in Seoul last year, and it kinda sucked, so I am happy to be going home for the holidays!   For now, I am madly trying to get my office in order (we just moved into our brand new building), finish up grades, complete a translation project (my first ever! I'm translating three songs for Park Jong Ho, a Korean CCM artist), and finish up my grad apps. Hahaha, realistic? OF COURSE!   But now...*yawwwwn*...time for a nap.  sleeeeeeepy.

      The swing festival this past weekend was amazing!    Highlight of the evening:  Dancing with Japan's "father of swing,"  who came as a guest.  Incredible! You know that a lead is darn good when he makes YOU feel like a pro.  Charles had videotaped me dancing with some other guys, but he missed this one! What I would have given to get that on tape!  Lowlight of the evening:  Dancing with this one dude and not knowing what THE HECK he was doing and feeling really stupid.  He seemed really good when dancing with other girls, so it must've been me. :(  All in all though, it was a high.  I got over my complex about asking guys to dance and was asking people left and right(guys are especially a minority at swing or salsa events in Korea).  Often it's a "hit or miss" kind of thing....like sometimes the guy dances super well and is an awesome lead, and other times the guy is a beginner who can't keep rhythm.  And sometimes their level is way over my head and I can't follow.  Or sometimes they are so sweaty that it's gross.  I was telling Jean in the car that I couldn't GET swing for the longest time.  And then, one day, swinging at a club in SF, something  clicked .  It was like a moment of epiphany when the movements I had learned and memorized actually made sense with the music.  Once that happened, it was like I could improvise to no end.  The same thing happened to me with salsa.  It just  clicked  one night at CoCoMo.    I still feel really nervous before swing or salsa dancing, especially because in Korea I can go about twice a year at the most.  I always feel like I must've forgotten how to dance, and usually the first dance  is  mediocre. But then it  clicks  again, and I'm seriously flying.    *sigh* I LOVE dancing.

      Horrible, horrible dream last night.  I dreamt that I was meeting Scott for the first time all over again, but that it went all wrong.  First of all, the meeting place was all mixed up, and we couldn't find each other for a while.  I remember wandering by myself on some busy, noisy street, feeling anxious and helpless.  Then, when I finally found him, he wasn't who he is, and in fact we didn't like each other at all.   I woke up this morning feeling like weeping.  The grief immediately turned into terror. Which first meeting was the dream? Which Scott was the real Scott?  And, then, all of a sudden, waves of immense relief washed over me, and I felt like crying for joy.  I looked out the window at the blue sky, and the sound of roosters crowing and frogs croaking reminded me of where I was.  I'm in Costa Rica, I told myself, and I'm going to talk to Scott over a broken connection this afternoon.  Funny how such simple facts could suddenly strike you as utterly amazing.  Scott is quite literally the man of my dreams.  About 5 months ago, before we even started corresponding over email, I had a dream about him. It was a mundane dream, so mundane that I can't even remember what it was about.  When I woke up, though, I was astonished that I had actually seen phillylo, in the flesh, living and breathing and existing. When I finally met Scott in person, I told him that he was taller than I had expected.  It was only two days later that I told him that it was because he was shorter in my dream. :)  John once told me about a philosopher who speculated that life is one big hallucination, and that our nocturnal dreams might actually be more "real" than our daily lives.  How do we know which side of consciousness is the dream? Now, I don't believe in such a worldview, but for one moment this morning, I had an existential crisis in which I wasn't sure what reality was.  It was frightening.    But then, God reached down from the heavens and caressed my cheek with the assurance of His blessings.  I  know  what is true, and what peace, what comfort, what joy there is where my Lord is!   Just two more weeks before I see him again, living and breathing and existing.  The man of my dreams.

      Hola from Costa Rica! I don't have much time to update-- internet rates are astronomical  here.  My first week here was amazing.  I am learning a lot of Spanish and meeting lots of people from different places like Canada, Holland, Brazil, and Switzerland.  Already I've gone mountain horsebackriding and surfing, and I plan on visiting a couple volcanoes and rainforests soon.  Playa Samara is unbelievably beautiful. Everyday I swim in the blue, temperate ocean, and read while sunbathing on the grey sand.  At night I stargaze and get lost in dreams about the future.    I'm reading Chesterton's  Orthodoxy , and have discovered that I am in love with this obese, witty,  brilliant  theologian.  This book is radical.  Who would've thunk? Radical orthodoxy.  Gotta update friendster with a new favorite book.  I had a mystical moment at the beach the first night I was here.  I could only describe it best through a poem, so I'll be updating my poetry page soon.  PURA VIDA!

      One of these days I am going to write about the whole story, here on blogger, since the thoughts-page-world is where it all began.  It might be better to commission Scott, since he's a better writer than I am....but we'll see.  I didn't even think about doing such a thing before, but now that I've told the story over and over again to close friends, I'm realizing that it blesses people tremendously.  Hm, I'm tired right now, but maybe tomorrow.  If not tomorrow, then I don't know when, because I am leaving for Costa Rica early Saturday morning, and won't be back for four weeks.

      I didn't know that Mark Wang read my page, until I got that shout-out from him a couple entries back. Hi Mark. :)  Anyway, I went to his page, and was struck by the entry:  urlLink "US immigration-- With friends like these, who needs enemies?"    My response to him, which I thought was too long to post on his comments page: _______________________________________________  Oh my gosh Mark! The same thing happened to me, just a few weeks ago when I came in from Korea! Can you imagine the culture shock? In Korea, they always assume that I am Korean unless I open my mouth and speak, or I tell them that I am American.  And then I come "home,"  where they assume I am some foreigner trying to get into the States with a fake passport.  I got the barrage of rude questions at the immigration checkpoint, too, but the lady even went so far as to take me over to the Immigration and Naturalization Services Desk for further "investigation." gr.   She went behind the counter, whispering to her superior, all of which I could plainly hear.  "Her passport looks two-toned to me, I've never seen anything like it. . . she  seems  to speak English fluently but . . . she says she's from Pasadena . . . etc."  After five minutes of this, I got so angry that I got up out of the designated seat to which I had been relegated, and stomped up to a pair of surprised faces at the counter.  "I can hear everything you are saying, and I think that this is ridiculous!  I was BORN HERE, do you understand??? I have other forms of evidence for you...here's my CA license, my STANFORD ID, my credit cards," one by one throwing the cards emphatically on the counter. "Go ahead, ask me anything.  I don't know what it's going to take to convince you."  They were definitely taken aback by such aggressive behavior coming out of such a "passive"- looking Asian girl who was clearly trying to sneak oh-so-quietly into America.  The male immigration officer coolly asked me a few more idiotic questions (What's the Stanford mascot?  Cardinal . Who's the point guard of the basketball team?  I have NO idea.  What's the nearest freeway to your house?  110.   Who's playing at the Rose Bowl?  I don't KNOW .) and then nodded at his coworker to stamp me in.  "Happy Holidays!" he said cheerily as I left. gr.  I was in such a state of shock for the next hour or two that I couldn't even have a decent conversation with my dad in the car for fear that I'd burst out crying. ____________________________________________________  I can understand that they need to be viligant during Orange Alert, but do they have to demean you and treat you as if you're guilty just because you don't look the part?  Like Mark, I also saw the blatant racial discrimination, whites or other clearly "American"-looking men and women being waved on right through.  What does it mean to look "American"???? For crying out loud! And what happened to "innocent until proven guilty" anyway?  Sure, the immigration checkpoint at the airport is not necessarily the court of law requiring due process, but it's the principle of the thing.  Just treat me like I'm innocent, with respect and civility, UNTIL you've proven that I'm guilty. Geez.    Sorry, got all fired up about that one. But, I did learn a profound lesson from the whole thing: it just made me realize that  I'm a stranger anywhere I go .  Whether I'm in Costa Rica, or Korea, or the U.S., or anywhere, I won't fully fit in...but I think that I like that, because it reminds me of my true citizenship anyway.  For me, being a missionary isn't about just some duty to God, some sacrifice I need to make for Him.  It's about the fact that the whole world is my home and not one localized place.  No one place is more HOME to me than another.   I wrote about this in a previous entry, but I think that it's worth recapitulating here.  Home is people, not a place.  And people are everywhere.  I love people, I love experiencing different cultures, I love traveling, I love learning languages, I love God's world, I love God's plan, I love the gospel...you can see why I couldn't stay here, in one place, my whole life.  I was telling Inna last night that I didn't have to use the word "missionary" to describe who I want to be.  It's just the same to me as living overseas, doing what I love, and faithfully following Christ wherever I am. Ultimately, there's only one place where I BELONG, only one place that I can truly call HOME, and that's in heaven with God Himself.  So even now, while I live this life, I just want to be with HIM, following HIM, because that's the closest thing to home there is.

      It was great to hear Harold speak again.  This entry is going to be mostly my notes on the sermon he preached this past Sunday at KCPC (in VA).  I think that you can go listen to it at kcpc.org.  "When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum.  By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.  A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.  When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the bost, walking on water; and they were terrified.  But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."  They they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading."    John 6:16-21  This passage highlights the answers to three questions about the person of Jesus: 1) Who is this Jesus? 2) Where is He? 3) What does He bring?  1.  Who is this Jesus?   Lord of the storm, Supernatural, "I AM" Himself.   At this point in the gospel narrative, everyone was confused about His identity; just before this passage, his followers had wanted to "take him by force and make Him king."  This incident shows that Jesus is the Lord of the storm, and that He is supernatural.  He doesn't fit into our normal categories.  He clearly evinces himself as King here, but of an entirely different sort of kingdom.  By walking on the water, He reveals His divinity and other-worldliness.  He also clearly chooses to whom He will reveal Himself.   Jesus reenacts Moses in chapter 6 of the gospel of John.  First, he feeds the multitudes, just as God provided manna for Moses and his people in the wilderness.  Then, He walks through the water here, just as Moses and the Israelites had miraculously crossed the Red Sea.  He was conveying to his disciples that He was greater than Moses, that He was the bread of life and lord over even nature.  God said to Moses that His name was "I AM."  Here, Jesus reveals that He is God Himself when He essentially says the same thing: "It is I."    When you see Jesus as He is, there's more than just liking Him.  He provokes us to worship, with holy awe and even dread.  The disciples fell down in worship.  Do I know Him?  The acid test of whether or not I know Christ is worship and obedience.  If I demand reasons for things or situations that I don't understand, then He isn't  Lord  of my life.  2.  Where is He?  In the storm, which is part of His loving plan.   Jesus is visible, or at other times,  visibly absent  (Harold used those words, I love it).  For instance, in John 6, there was a "lack" of food for the great multitude and yet somehow they were all fed; Jesus was not there when the disciples got on their boat, yet somehow He had  always been with them.  In Psalm 77, the psalmist writes,"The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook.  Your way was in the sea, Your path in the great waters, and Your footsteps were not seen."  Real love gets grieved and troubled by you, and it takes time to bother you. STORMS, whether the kinds that are disciplinary consequences of sin or the kinds that are sharpening tests, ARE A PART OF GOD'S LOVING PLAN.   Children need to learn how to associate discipline with love.  Otherwise, you have children growing up only knowing storms of discipline, not understanding its purpose, and rebelling in resentment and anger.  Or, if parents do not discipline at all, children end up being spoiled because everything they do is "understandable" or "natural".  And spiritually, if a storm comes their way, they get angry and resent God, demanding reasons.     The perfect balance of discipline and love is in Jesus.  Storms are given by God; in the midst of the wind and fury, someone is right in the middle of it wanting to meet you.  Jesus wanted His disciples to see Him in a fresh new light, and could only do that by meeting them in the storm.  3.  What does He bring?  Heaven to earth.   This incident is a brief glimpse of our final rest, our final destination, the "shores" to which we are heading.  It's not for everyone, because there are people who put all their energy into making a perfect world here.  Our hope is in a brand new place, the world that God is bringing.  Every miracle in the Bible, according to covenant theology, is an "eschatalogical intrusion."  The miracles of Jesus show us what heaven is like.  Storms of chaos and judgment can threaten to overwhelm us, but Jesus walking on the water shows us that in heaven, the water is forever calm, that it is a whole new world altogether.  If you take Jesus on board, the gates of heaven begin to open in front of you.    Jesus went through the worst storm imaginable in order to absorb all evil and injustice.  He is the Lord who doesn't crush you, but asks you to "take Him into the boat."  For believers, there is going to be a day coming when there won't be any more storms; we anticipate unhindered, ineffable intimacy with God Himself.  Someone once asked Mother Theresa, "How do you deal with all the suffering and injustice that you see everyday in India?" To which she answered, "It's like one bad night at a motel compared to where we're headed."

      It's amazing how one night can change your entire life: past, present, and future.    ...What I thought the string of pivotal events in my past meant wasn't even close to the full story.    ...When I woke up this morning, my first thoughts made joy leap into my heart and I wanted to cry out to God in thanksgiving, praise, and worship.    ...What I imagine to be my future has suddenly become far clearer; the fulfillment of my dreams suddenly seems so close it's palpable.   Love is a strange and wonderful thing.  It is a mystery that can not be captured with mere words. It's more than a feeling... it's unwavering commitment... it's giving life... it's an awe-struck faith in someone, in the beauty of who they are... it's a redemption of past pain... it's an experience in the profound depths of grace... it's the resurrection of Christ in me drawn out and accentuated by the one I love...    It's all coming together for me now, how love between two people could be the closest thing to heaven on earth.

      So I'm feeling calmer now.  It's been a productive day and things for my classes are pretty set.  I could always do more, but I figure that stressing myself out is not a good idea.    I am really really REALLY excited about this semester.  I'll be busier than ever, but doing things that I love.  Besides teaching classes I'll be:  - Leading a small group on apologetics. - Singing on the praise team for the international service. - Practicing swing-dancing with a partner using some videos, and maybe even performing at the Festival. - Organizing a North Korea prayer group.  - Training with a missions group on campus that focuses on spreading the gospel through the arts, and helping them prepare for the summer trip.  Lately I've been feeling a little sad that I'll be leaving all of this in just a few months.  I've come to adore Handong, and Pohang feels like home.  I am appreciating every single day, and all the little details that I had taken for granted are striking me as precious.  And yet, a long-distance relationship is not ideal, and I have A LOT to look forward to once I get back to the States.  When it comes down to it, I know that it is time to move on.  This semester feels markedly different; it is very special because of the very fact that it is the very last.    God's timing is truly amazing.  At the end of last semester, I was asking myself, "How on earth am I going to leave this place!?" absolutely horrified at the thought.  But during the three months that I was gone, my life changed completely, and all of a sudden, I am already saying goodbye with my foot halfway out the door.  It'll still be hard to leave, but that my heart has found its home makes it much easier.  These next few months will be a time of savoring and remembering, letting go and passing on, hoping and dreaming.  I really wouldn't have my last semester here any other way, and I guess God knew that before I did.

      I've been listening to this song obsessively for the past week.  It's old, but I rediscovered it when I was in Costa Rica with only my dinky CD player and all my old CD's (my cd collection has been spoiled by the advent of mp3s).     OBSESSION by Delirious?  What can I do with my obsession With the things I cannot see Is there madness in my being Is it wind that blows the trees  Sometimes you're further than the moon Sometimes you're closer than my skin And you surround me like a winter fog You've come and burned me with a kiss  And my heart burns for you And my heart burns  And I'm so filthy with my sin I carry pride like a disease You know I'm stubborn God and I'm longing to be close You burn me deeper than I know  I feel lonely without hope I feel desperate without vision You wrap around me like a winter coat You come and free me like a bird  And my heart burns for you And my heart burns for you    There's something about the intensity of this song that grabs me and makes me look at myself honestly. I love the acoustics too; that one simple guitar refrain just carries me away. I would listen to this song when I was on the beach, under the shade of a palm tree, looking at the ocean, and I would experience a powerful, acute longing for God.    It's interesting how morbid I can be at times; sometimes I just wish that God would snatch me up in His arms and take me away in a chariot of fire like He did with Elijah.  In such moments, I feel as if I could leave everything that I've stored up in this life, because it's just so lucid how much greater, immeasurably greater, it would be to be WITH HIM.  It also strikes me that this desire to leave the liminal world seems to surface most saliently when I am full of satisfaction and joy.  I don't think that I have ever been happier in my entire life.  I love my friends and family. I love living in Korea and traveling as much as I can. I love teaching at Handong, and I love what I am studying. I love being in love like I've never been in love before with someone who completely blows me away.  But I am a pure hedonist, in the sense of Piper, and all of this only whets my appetite.  If all that is good in my life is merely a taste of heaven, then by all means, give me heaven Lord!     But Paul made that profound statement in his letter to the Philippians, that to die is gain, but  to live  is  Christ .  I think that I've gotten to a point in my life where I deeply understand the concept that  to die is gain .  Looking back at my journal for the past couple of years, my longing for heaven has been a persistent, throbbing theme, constantly hovering around my soul.  But to understand that  to live  is  Christ -- that's the secret to the abundant life, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface of its significance.  Strangely enough, it is in witnessing and experiencing suffering that Christ's life in me seems to become clearer.  With time will come maturity in this respect, I'm sure.  Lord, to die is easy, but what does it mean to  live ?

      Today is my last full day in Playa Samara.  What an experience.  It's been amazing. Things that I will miss:  - waking up to the sound of roosters and a blue sky - passing by the pretty horse pasture on the way to school, the ocean sparkling in the distance behind it - all the people i 've met here, sunbathing with them on the beach, hanging out with them in the bars at night, getting past superficial layers and having meaningful conversations  - walking home along the beach at dusk - the sound of costa rican spanish - mi familia tica, especially playing with my little sister here - the brilliant stars at night - swimming in the ocean everyday -  batidos , blended drinks made of fresh local fruit in water or milk -  gallo pinto , a traditional costa rican breakfast dish that i've eaten nearly every morning for the past four weeks - the feeling of wonder every time i realize that my spanish has indeed improved  - my cute little bug-infested room - the plastic rocking chairs on our porch, in which i like to sit in the cool of morning or at twilight - taking cold showers at the end of a dusty, hot day, and feeling unbelievably fresh  - talking to scott over a broken connection and feeling overwhelming grateful that i can even hear his voice, because it's affirmation that he exists.

      I made the big decision yesterday.  After a lot of prayer, thinking, re-thinking, searching the Word, and talking to Scott,   I've decided not to go to graduate school this fall.   I will re-apply to comp lit programs once Scott and I have gotten married and settled down.  This will mean having to change from a Ko lit focus to a Latin American lit focus (with Ko lit as my minor), so that wherever we end up, I'll have more options in terms of schools.  The problem with wanting to focus on Ko Lit was that I could literally only apply to 4 schools in the entire nation.  For the past couple of weeks, I was seriously considering going to the University of British Columbia in Canada, because it just so happens that their masters portion is terminal, unlike the US PhD programs I had applied to.  That would have given me the opportunity to at least get a masters in comp lit with a korean focus, which made the prospect of having to apply later for a PhD with a latin am focus seem much more enticing.  The costs involved ultimately made it unfeasible however.  As an international student, I was only eligible for a partial tuition scholarship.  Sure, the tuition would've amounted to only a little over a couple thousand dollars with the scholarship, but then there were living costs.  And Vancouver's expensive.  I still would've incurred at least a $12k debt by the end of 9 months.  It also didn't sit right with me that, since I'm going to be a student for awhile, the money to pay off that debt would've been coming solely from Scott's income after we got married.  Since I could get a PhD in the US without incurring  any  debt, following such a "great opportunity" seemed extravagant.     On top of that, and more importantly, I would have been too busy, and too far, and too poor, to maintain a healthy relationship with Scott.  I just wrote that sentence very easily, but it took me a couple of weeks to realize this.    So this week, I had to turn down offers to two schools.  Admittedly, it wasn't the easiest thing to do.  Right now I feel incredibly happy though.  I almost cried telling Scott my decision, I was so happy.  God has done a lot in my heart through all of this.  I now have a proper fear and awe of marriage, and the process involved in dying to myself that I might be joined with the man I love.  I also realized just how committed I am to Scott, and just how much I really do love him.    Grad school, despite my love of studying and teaching literature, is subordinate to my desire to go overseas as a missionary.  It has always been, in my mind, a means to an end.  I am passionate about both the end as well as the means, but the priority has always been clear.  When Scott entered my life, there was radical paradigm shift, because all of a sudden, I was going to be a missionary regardless of whether or not I went to grad school.  I will still go to grad school, I'm sure, but it won't be in the way or in the places I had originally planned.  Am I ok with that? Completely.  The past three weeks have been about clarifying and solidifying the order of my priorities: God, Scott, me.  Gosh, to write these things now makes it all seem so simple, but what feelings of uncertainty, doubt, fear, and insecurity had been flooding my heart these past few weeks!    So what will I be doing this fall?  Studying my butt off in Spanish, taking classes at a community college, working part-time, concentrating on growing with Scott, and planning for the wedding.  Geez, and we're not even officially engaged. :)    But I'm already married to him in my heart.

      I just gave my blog address, as well as Scott's, to one of my students! This is my first time doing that.  Michael, you better feel special. ^^    Michael came to visit me during office hours, and we were conferencing about his essay, which is due on Tuesday.  The essay topic is "three characteristics you look for in a spouse."  After working through his draft and finding ways in which he could improve his writing, we just started chatting about how he met his girlfriend and whether or not he was old enough to be thinking about marriage (he's a sophomore).  Of course, he ended up asking me if I was thinking about marriage, and I went ahead and told him all about Scott.  hehe.    It was a different experience from the other zillion times that I've told the story however, because this student actually studied one of Scott's stories, "Garlic," in my class last semester, and wrote an in-class essay on his poem, "Moon in the Trees"!  He was completely shocked when I told him that the author of those works is the person I met and fell in love with just this past January.  It amazed him that I hardly knew Scott at the time we were studying his material in November.  It tickled him that I had met the mother who is the subject of "Moon in the Trees,"  that indeed she is going to be my mother-in-law. hahahahahahahahaha!  I promised Michael that someday I'd show Scott what he wrote about the poem in his in-class essay.    I definitely need to write my own version of our story one of these days.

      These quotes about marriage are straight from  urlLink Joyce's blog , but I liked them a lot so I'm posting them too.   "Keep your eyes wide open before marriage, half shut afterwards." Benjamin Franklin  "The difficulty with marriage is that we fall in love with a personality, but we must live with a character." Peter Devries  "You come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by seeing an imperfect person perfectly."  I like the last one the best.  I always tell Scott that he's perfect, which of course he resists.   Perfect to me, perfect for me , is what I reply.  In the Song of Solomon, the Beloved calls his bride "perfect" too--  "perfect" not by some static definition, but "perfect" in the sense of God's grace and divine love and deep knowledge of us.

      i swear, t.s. eliot is a kindred spirit.  excerpted from  East Coker  (No.2 of   urlLink Four Quartets  , first and last stanzas)  In my beginning is my end. In succession Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended, Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass. Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires, Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth Which is already flesh, fur and faeces, Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf. Houses live and die: there is a time for building And a time for living and for generation And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.  ...  Home is where one starts from. As we grow older The world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated Of dead and living. Not the intense moment Isolated, with no before and after, But a lifetime burning in every moment And not the lifetime of one man only But of old stones that cannot be deciphered. There is a time for the evening under starlight, A time for the evening under lamplight (The evening with the photograph album). Love is most nearly itself When here and now cease to matter. Old men ought to be explorers Here or there does not matter We must be still and still moving Into another intensity For a further union, a deeper communion Through the dark cold and the empty desolation, The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.

      um, i had a really disturbing dream last night.  i was in the passenger seat of a car, driving somewhere with my friends.   it's broad daylight.  all of a sudden, out of nowhere, someone shows up outside the passenger seat window, and is trying to climb through.  he is obviously trying to kill us, so i grab the nearest object to use as a weapon.  it's a long, thick chopstick, the kind my father used to use to punish us when we were young.  somehow i am able to pin the guy down, and i stab him over and over again with the chopstick.    i  killed  him. :Z it was incredibly disturbing. just before i woke up, i was being questioned by the police, crying and saying that i did it in self-defense...  i woke up and felt terrible.  what the heck is going on in me???? the violent parts of my dream have been flashing through my mind all day, oddly pricking my conscience, even though it wasn't real.

      I've been thinking about my mom recently and how things have changed between us.  When she was here a couple of weeks ago, I think that I saw her in a new light.  Consequently that meant seeing our relationship with new eyes as well.    When I was younger, umma was very controlling.  She would force me to do extracurricular activity after extracurricular activity, to excel at my studies, to always be the best.  I resented her because I thought that she was using me for her own glory.  And, in my own subtle way, I ended up rebelling fiercely when I was in high school.  I snuck around with a boy that she despised, and lied all the time to see him.  She lost all trust in me after awhile.  I don't blame her; she knew better than I did how much I was hurting myself.    Once I got to college I regretted the way I had behaved, and immediately tried to start afresh both with myself and with God.  Since this began away from home, however, my mom did not witness the change and continued to regard herself as the better authority on how I should live my life.  She always questioned my decisions as well as my motives.  She tried to control me over the distance, but it wasn't working.  It tired me out to talk to her, and I stopped telling her about my life.  Our phone calls eventually amounted to merely superficial exchanges of pleasantries and basic information.  We drifted apart even more.  Discovering my passion for literature and my calling to mission during my senior year set me on a trajectory toward quite a transformation.  I used to be aimless; now I'm ambitious.  I used to be happy-go-lucky; now I'm more serious.  I used to be afraid of change; now I thrive on it.  I used to wait for opportunities; now I make them.  I used to be self-centered; now I'm more aware of the world around me.    By the time I graduated from college, my mother became routinely shocked at the decisions I was making.  To her it seemed like I was making rash decisions based on unfounded confidence.  I had made the mistake of not letting her see me reinvent myself, and to her, I was just being impulsive.  If there was one refrain that I kept hearing from her at that time, it was,  Use your head Sandy.  Think before you say things that you can't follow through on.  Oh, it irritated me so much at the time. But again, looking back, I really can't blame her.  It was when I broke up with James that I made a conscious decision to open my life to her again.  The most honest conversation I have ever had with her was when I told her, in tears, why I could no longer remain with him and live out my dreams.  She was uncharacteristically quiet the whole time I talked.  When I was finished, she acknowledged that I had thought through things well, and that it was the right decision.  To hear her say that to me was a huge breakthrough, a defining moment for our future relationship.  Eventually, umma caught on that I was no longer the rebellious, wishy-washy, discontented teenager that gave her so much heartache ten years ago.  Since then, our relationship has been going through a process of healing and growth.  Once in awhile we'd revert to our old patterns- in which she would doubt me, and I would be annoyed.  I think we've come to a point, though, in which we've finally broken out of our habitual, mutual self-confinement.  It's hard to pinpoint when it exactly happened, but I am now able to listen to her criticisms as potentially constructive, and she is able to trust my judgment in most decisions.  At some point, she stopped saying, "That's not the way you should do it" and instead started asking, "So that's what you want to do?"  When she was here a couple of weeks ago, we slept in the same bed, and she'd keep me up late at night and wake me up early in the morning just to talk.   How many more opportunities will I have to talk to you like this?  she would respond to my sleepy grumbling.  We talked about Scott, we talked about my future, we talked about wedding plans.  Those were such peaceful conversations.  There was a day when I went with her to Umsung, the country village in which she grew up.  The entire extended family was there, some 25 people squished into my uncle's tiny little house.  She was very animated that day; I just spent a lot of time watching her interact with everyone.  I found myself admiring her charisma, her good looks, her quick mind.  Sadly enough, I can't recall ever consciously admiring her before that moment.  I saw her with new eyes.   We have a deeper connection now.  Sometimes I just crave talking to her, because she is often able to diffuse the riot in my brain when things seem over-complicated in my life.  When I was in high school, I would never have believed it if anyone told me that I'd be friends with my mom someday.  But here we are, and what we have is beyond friendship.  I am a version of her, and my whole life has been, in a sense, a process of differentiation from her.  But in the end, that differentiation seems to have revealed just how much I am actually  like  her more than anything.  For me, this is the profound, astonishing discovery of an obvious truth:  I am my mother's daughter.

      do i really trust God? what does it mean to trust Him?   following through on a conviction vs. trying to control the circumstances.  these two actions could potentially be confused.  one is good and the other isn't.   i'm trying to make a hard decision right now, and i am totally shaken up because i find myself second-guessing everything that i am thinking.  more disturbingly, i find myself second-guessing God.  something just occurred to me: can you follow through on a conviction BY controlling the circumstances? i suppose so.  does that mean that i won't regret it later? could you still end up regretting aspects of a decision that you  knew  was the right thing to do at the time?

      The Korean Parliament voting to impeach President Ro. Bombings in Madrid. The crazy US elections. The crisis in the Middle East. People starving and dying in North Korea. The HIV epidemic in Africa. The list goes on.  What a world, and here I am going crazy in my own world.    My mind has been running in circles and swinging wildly on a pendulum as I try to figure out what's going on after I leave Korea.  Yesterday I was getting married in October and putting off grad school for a couple of years.  This morning I was going to USC in the fall, dropping out at the end of one academic year, and getting married next May.  Now it looks like I might be in Vancouver for a year instead, getting a Masters instead of a PhD, and getting married next July.  Who knows what tomorrow will bring?    I want to take things "one step at a time," but that's not so easy when you feel like there are twenty possible steps you could take for that  next  step, you know what I mean?    Am I any closer to the right decision? Oops, I meant  we .  I keep talking to Scott in the first person.     Lord help me.  I feel so self-centered when I think about the world  out there , and how little I am actually making a difference.  I need to pray.

      My swing partner and I had our first practice tonight.  It was really fun.  Both of us are learning, but we strike a good balance because I can think more in terms of creativity and musicality, while he's into form and technique.  Today we just showed each other what we knew, and practiced with music, but by next week we should have some videos to work with.  I'm excited.   There have been so many things on my mind lately that it was nice just to relax and dance for a couple of hours.   I don't know what this world would be like without art and music and dance and literature.  Just think about it.  How maddeningly insipid.

      the snow was falling today, the wind howling furiously.  while my students were writing essays, i looked out the window at the thrashing pines, the distant rice fields powdered in white, and the zillions of monster snowflakes that came hurling at me on the other side of the windowpane, from the other side of the white sky. and i felt far far away.  later in the evening i crossed a patch of fresh snow underneath some dimly lit lampstands, and my feet sank in softly with each step. i looked back; i had made a lonely, unadulterated trail of my own footsteps from the front doors of my building.  and i felt so far far away.  is it snowing anywhere else in the world? of course it is, but not in the places where i've sprinkled my soul over the course of my life.  outside korea, in all the places that hold people i love, people who have left indelible marks upon my life, the snow is not falling.  do they know that i am thinking of them? do they know that i remember them? do they know that i love them? do they know that i can never never never never ever forget them? how can they know? i hope they know.  but i am so far far away.  as i keep following God, to wherever He points me on the globe, this will be my life.  i will always be starting over in new places and saying goodbye once they've become old.  i will always be meeting new, special people to love and cherish, and eventually saying goodbye to them once they've been engraven on my heart.  i will always be a long-distance friend to most of my friends for most of our lives.  and the places, the memories, the people, the histories-- they are all slowly amassing into something large, noble, beautiful-- but the relentless distance makes it poignant, subtle, and elusive.     when the world is your playground, sometimes the snow falls and you find yourself all alone.  but then you look up, and every snowflake that falls from the sky and clings to your coat is a dear dear friend-- and you watch-- as each one melts slowly into your fabric.

       warning: this entry might make sense only to a very few people. it is extremely vague, because what i am feeling is difficult to articulate.   The human spirit is so much more complex than we could ever imagine.  Who would have thought that the life-changing discovery of love, accompanied by such amazing joy, would also inevitably involve a deeply painful process of grieving?  With Scott, an exciting, beautiful new world has opened up before me.  But that also means the loss of the old world, the old life.    I fell in love, and knew that my life had changed drastically, but could not anticipate how thoroughly this change would affect every part of me.  My life is slowly catching up to this truth, and it is all new to me.  In a sense, it is like a new wineskin.  I can't do things the way I used to do them.  Preparing myself to become one with the man I love means a whole new way of living, a whole new vision of the world.  At the same time that I have never been happier in my life, I am mourning the loss of singlehood.  Every major decision from this point on must factor in  his  life, which I want to do most willingly, but am not sure how to do just yet.     My heart is fully committed to him, and this commitment is making every decision an experience in... wedded-ness , for lack of a better word.  The fact that he is not here, however, creates the disturbing psychological lag of being in between two worlds.  It is a sort of unsettling disconnect that the devil has seized upon, trying to flood the gap with insecurities, doubts, and fears about  myself .  Because of my strong conviction that God has brought Scott into my life so that we would be together for the rest of our lives, living out His calling for us, Satan is trying to make me doubt everything else.  Right now, my greatest spiritual battle is letting go of my old self-- indeed, my old vision of my future self.  And yet, I would not change my situation for the world.  I have never been more filled, more certain about the future, more aware of the amazing grace of God and His grand love for me.  Paradoxical as it may seem, I am  joyfully  mourning.  I could never have anticipated this.  On the one hand, it feels completely foreign to me, and is quite frightening.  But on the other hand, I have no greater desire than to be with the man whom God has chosen to be my life-partner in bringing Him glory, and to love him the way he deserves to be loved.    In time, being one with him will become as natural as breathing.  I  know  this, and it gives me immense strength and comfort that this process is a necessary one.  God has begun teaching me to be a wife.

      Now that Scott's written our story, the poem he wrote for me as a Valentine's gift will make sense to you.  It's the best gift I've ever received, and it's now up on my poetry page.

      Winter in Pohang is striking.  On a day like today, the sky is pale blue, without a cloud in the sky.  The air is bitingly cold, the wind mercilessly whipping your skin.  The paradox is that somehow, the sun is shining so brightly that at times you even fancy yourself warm when the wind isn't blowing.  It is shining so glaringly that you have to squint to look afar.  sun, wind.  coldness, warmth.  winter, brightness.  clear, glaring.   This is my life at this moment in time. I have taken a step back, just to see it all at once, and I find it striking indeed.  Whether I want to laugh or cry I do not know.

      it's spring, and i'm suffering. i can't believe that i still have to get through almost two more months before i see scott again. it's crazy-- i've seen his precious face for only SIX freakin days of my entire life.  unreal.  his face is starting to get hazy in my mind.  i can't remember what it's like to  be  with him, to experience him with all my senses.    the phone is both comforting and infuriating at the same time.  it's comforting, because i love the sound of his voice. i adore hearing about what's on his mind and what he's feeling and what he's doing and what he has experienced on any given day.  it's infuriating because the time difference and the ever-present annoying buzz of a bad connection remind me of how far away he is, and of how much more time i have to wait before i see him again.  when i was in seoul, i saw jean and john interact for the first time as a couple. so sweet.  total pda.  gotta love my bro. :)  on sunday night, we were all watching tv when i commented that the actress on this one commercial was really beautiful.  john responded, "she's ok." i couldn't believe it, but before he could go on, i finished his sentence: "but jean's better."  "yup," was my brother's reply, to which jean smiled shyly. so cute.    gr, i miss scott.  we'll double date in la. it'll be fun.  i can't handle it! i'm dying over here.  54 days.     in other news, the dressmaker forgot  the train  of all things.  she assures us that everything is under control though, that she'll just make an attachable one. hm, we'll see how that turns out. i'm going to check it out in may.  other than that slip of a  major  detail, the dress is beautiful.  i'm not sure if i'm making a mistake by going slightly unconventional with both the color and the design, though.  i'm no designer, and i'm wondering if it was a mistake to let myself semi-design it...thank goodness for the four girlfriends who came along with me! ro, joyce, jo, and sang hwa-- you were all so patient and helpful.  i'd have been a neurotic mess without your impeccable taste and sound advice.   thankfully my mom is bridezilla, so i don't have to be. when i got to the boutique, the dressmaker commented that my mother was very, um,  fastidious .  apparently umma had called her several times in the days preceding my first fitting, often more than once a day, to remind her of everything we wanted.  so when i finally had the dress on, trying to explain to her my preferences for the design, she said more than once, "tell me exactly what you want.  i'm going to make it exactly the way you want it, because i don't want to hear it from your mother." :) hahahahahahaha.  gotta love my mom. as you can imagine, when umma heard about the train, she called the dressmaker (even though it was 11 pm) and gave her a piece of her mind.  :)    anyway, as for wedding planning, i've given up.  umma and i were disagreeing about everything (ceremony site, reception site, number of guests, time of year, food, etc.), when at some point i realized that it wasn't worth the stress.  so i told her that she can plan it and just ask me for input once in awhile. hehe  *sigh* i just want to  see  scott.  i just want to marry him.

      I watched a special program on CNN the other day about the West Bank barrier, and it just made me sad and angry about the situation over there.  It's not just a wall surrounding the West Bank, but a system of cages, entrapping Palestinians so that they can neither leave nor enter their own lands freely.  Qalqilya is a city that has been affected acutely; what was once a thriving city built upon the free flow of market and culture between Israelis and Palestinians is now a veritable ghost town, completely surrounded by the barrier.  The Israelis say that they built the wall to preempt Palestinian suicide bombers; Palestinians say that they resort to violence because the Israelis left them with nothing to lose, and all they want is their freedom.  When will this crazy cycle of violence end?! I can't help but think that this approach to Israeli occupation of Palestinian land is all wrong. It does not promote peace in the least.  The wall is poisoning the atmosphere on both sides.  The program pointed out an interesting irony that is possibly developing around the West Bank barrier, however.  It was built to divide, but more and more Palestinians are beginning to favor a one-state solution because of it.  Some 28% of Palestinians in a recent poll favored a one-state solution, which is very high considering that there is not an Israeli or Palestinian party that espouses a one-state solution as its platform.  The Palestinians have been so stripped of everything, that now many only want one thing: freedom.  One man, one vote.  This has interesting implications, because as the wall drives more and more Palestinians to an overriding thirst for freedom at all costs, even at the cost of their dream for an independent Palestinian state, Israel might end up in a sticky situation.  Should the Palestinians favor a one-state solution, would Israel concede to it at the risk of losing power to the sheer number of Palestinians in a true democracy?  If they don't, they will risk invoking censure from the international community, and even losing some of their most ardent advocates.  Will the cycle of violence surrounding Jerusalem ever end?  I don't know. A deep part of me believes that it won't end until Christ comes back.  Osama Bin Laden said after 9/11 that America will not live in peace before peace reigns in Palestine. His words were meant to spite, but there is a grain of prophecy in them.  It seems to me that the world will not live in peace until peace reigns in the New Jerusalem.   Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.    Revelation 21:1-4

       urlLink Jo's  in Korea, and she came to visit us yesterday.  It was enlightening to hear about her past few months back in Australia.  She left before Ro, Joyce, and me, and everything she said was, in a sense, giving us a glimpse of what it will be like to be on the other side of this huge transition as we leave Handong.  It all sounds quite difficult, painful, and strangely close to home.  As she described her everyday routine, I pictured myself doing the very same things, going through the very same struggles.  I've had fears creep into my mind when I think about what it will be like to be married and living in Baltimore...I can imagine it being a struggle everyday to get up, not knowing a single person in the city besides my husband, having to be pro-active in seeking out opportunities for study, work, and friendships, searching for a sense of purpose to motivate each day.  It occurred to me yesterday that I'm leaving everything I know to enter into a world that is foreign both literally and figuratively; literally, because I'll be in an unfamiliar place starting from scratch, and figuratively, because I know absolutely nothing about what it means to be a wife, or to be married.    I can imagine what it would be like to start in a new place if I were  alone , since I've done that more than a few times, but at this point it's very difficult to imagine living  with a man,  even if I love him more than anyone else in the world.  Will the fact that the man I love is by my side make starting over in a new place not only easier, but exciting and enjoyable?  Or will it be torturous counting down the hours and minutes, just waiting for him to come home from work, while I sit at home, unavailingly making meager attempts at productivity? The latter possibility shakes me up.  The reality will probably be a mysterious mixture of both.  Umma unintentionally educed another fear of mine when we were talking on the phone a couple of days ago.  "You should apply to grad school this year, before you get married, so that you can get full financial support as an independent," she encouraged.  I told her that I couldn't, that since I am changing my focus to Latin American lit, I need at least a year or two of classes to educate myself in the field.  "Well, then when are you going to apply?" Next fall, or the year after.  She was quiet.   Well, it looks like you won't end up going at all then.  You never know what could happen in those two years...are you ok with that?   Of course, I don't care, whatever, was my flippant reply. A surge of deep misgivings resurfaced, however, and dread filled my heart at the possibility that she might be right...  *sigh* I thought that I had let go of it all, but it looks like these fears are going to keep returning to haunt me.  Why do I always think a gazillion steps ahead of time, somehow trying to take into account all possible alternatives and options for any given decision that I might have to make?!  It's ridiculous.  Just when I think that I am finally trusting in the Lord with all my heart, I find that I am still leaning on my own understanding.

        Good Friday     ...A video aired on the Arabic-language news channel Al-Jazeera showed three Japanese hostages held at gunpoint and threatened with knives.   The video was delivered to Al-Jazeera with a written demand: Withdraw Japanese troops from Iraq within three days or the hostages would be burned alive.   ...Video of the three Japanese hostages showed them being manhandled, humiliated and threatened with guns and knives -- at times, the knives pressed to their throats.  The names of the three were seen on passports in news footage. They are Koriyama Soichiro, who has a press card issued in Jordan for Weekly Asahi, and Imai Noriaki -- both men. The third is Takato Nahoko, a woman.    . . .  Do not go gentle into that good night,  Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  Because their words had forked no lightning they  Do not go gentle into that good night.   Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,  And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,  Do not go gentle into that good night.   Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   And you, my father, there on the sad height,  Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.  Do not go gentle into that good night.  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.    (written by Thomas on the eve of his father's death)  . . .    Now when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" Some of those who stood by, when they heard that, said, "Look, He is calling for Elijah!" Then someone ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink, saying, "Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down."   And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last.    Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.  So when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly this Man was the Son of God!"

      I am teaching mostly writing this semester.  Two sections of  Grammar and Composition , four sessions a week in the Writing Lab.  It's ok, but I really miss teaching lit.  Looking back at last semester, my job was my life because it just lit me up to see the minds and souls of my students unravel before me as we plumbed the human condition through literary art.  And because this is Korea, each class was not only a lesson in reading and discussion, but often also a trenchant cultural encounter.    Compared to that, teaching writing is much too technical, methodical, precise, and dry for my taste.  We are going through the process of writing reaction essays at the moment, and I was pleased to find that the textbook unit includes Dylan Thomas'  Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night.   In the book, it's merely presented as an example of a written prompt that can incite a deep and thoughtful reaction from the reader, but I seized upon it to teach a poetry lesson.    I have always loved that particular poem, but I love it more now after having taught it to my classes.  The students absolutely blew me away with their interpretations of Thomas' obscure images and conflicted, passionate elocution.  There was this one girl who took the image of    Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay Rage, rage against the dying of the light.   and interlaced the sounds and dynamism of the ocean's waves splashing into a bay with its likeness to human frailty and the psychological journey toward death.  She even got up and drew a visual representation on the whiteboard.  It's for moments like that that I dream of becoming a comp lit prof.     Do Not Go Gentle into that Good Night  is a decisively difficult poem, but I find that sometimes advanced ESL students are forced to be more analytical with literature than native speakers.  Without even being aware of the conventions of the "close-reading" method in literary analysis, they end up close-reading a poem just because they have to deal with the multiple definitions of words to even understand the poem at a basic level.  This involved analytical process sometimes comes to a thrilling fruition of layered, complex interpretations that are often far more sophisticated than you'd expect from ESL students.  I always seem to learn so much more from my students than they learn from me. . .*sigh* when I'm teaching lit.             Joyce told me today that it seems like I am not fully  here .  "Other-worldly" is the euphemism she used.  She was saying that for her and Ro, their world is as big as Handong, and whereas that  used  to be true for me, it's no longer so.  She's right, half the time my head is in the clouds, dreaming of what is to come.  Half of my heart feels like it is beating on the other side of the planet.  I wish that I could be  here  as passionately and as committedly as I was last semester.  But it's time to go, and everything seems to be signalling that imminent departure.  From the timely life-changing discovery of love in the winter, to my dry teaching schedule this semester, to the fact that all my good friends here are also leaving Handong in June...it's just all one long, drawn-out goodbye.

      I have been meditating on the names of God this week.  The book  Experiencing God  has a great list in its appendix that surveys all the names and titles of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit in the Bible.  That, coupled with a stimulating conversation I had with Scott at the beginning of the week about theological issues, really had me dwelling on the  nature  of God as revealed through  history .  It occurred to me that God had to take all of history to clarify His Holy, Triune nature for rebellious, ungrateful, depraved, blind, yet  beloved  mankind.  The people of God only understood Him as God the Righteous Judge, the Provider, the great I AM in the Old Testament, and it wasn't until Jesus' life that they began to understand Him as God the Father  and  God the Son. "I and My Father are one," was Jesus' special message.  And it was only after Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, that the people of God received the penetrating ministry of the Holy Spirit.     We now have the full revelation of God, and His Spirit  dwells within us .  The people of the Old Testament were also saved by faith, but the difference was that the yearly sacrifices performed by the priests were only "a matter of...  external  regulations applied until the time of the new order" (Heb 9:10).  The first tabernacle was an illustration for "the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the  conscience  of the worshipper" (vs 9).  In other words, the sacrifices were a constant reminder of man's slavery to his sinful nature, since they had to be performed annually.  The law laid the groundwork for the new convenant by revealing the seriousness of sin in God's sight,  the necessity of atonement for sin against the holiness of God, and the necessity of a mediator between God and man.  It was with this indispensable backdrop that Jesus entered the world's stage as the bright Lamb of God, and it was through the offering of His own body that "we have been sanctified once and for all" (Heb 10:10), forever freed from our bondage to sin and death.  It was so that He could "perfect" (vs 14) us in His image by a complete internal revolution that Jesus died and was resurrected.  We are now free to be slaves to God, inextricably bound to Him, which He achieved not by chains, but by making  us  His "temple" (1 Cor 3:16), His "building" (1 Cor 3:9), His "field" (1 Cor 3:9), His "home" (Jn 14:23), His own BODY.  This He could only accomplish by becoming fully human, living a sinless life, dying for the world, and being raised again to life, effectively undoing the cursed Fall of man once and for all.  Jesus had to die because He was fully human.  Jesus had to be resurrected because He was fully divine and completely sinless.  He CONQUERED sin and death by virtue of Himself because there was  no other way .  Love required human free will, and that free will led to sin, but even free will and sin couldn't stop the invincible loving will of God.  He is the ultimate author and finisher of our faith because we couldn't have been saved any other way and still experience True Love.    If He were still walking among us, He wouldn't be living  within  us.                Meditating on the wonderful array of names that reveal who He is, it is evident that the Father's characteristics are distinct from the Son's characteristics, both of which are distinct from the Holy Spirit's characteristics.  Is this to say that God is not One but three? Certainly not! It reveals the immaculate, blinding beauty of holy diversity within unity, the glorious multi-dimensionality and infinite  depth  of God.  Our puny minds could  not  have been able to comprehend God at all, if He had chosen to reveal Himself  all at once .  He is so infinitely and beautifully deep and wide and layered and complex in His Holy, Triune nature, that to know Him in full revelation required its outworking in finite time for finite beings.  So He made it into the greatest story of all, weaving it throughout the history of the world, that we might know Him  intimately .    God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit has always been both transcendent and immanent, but took the necessary time for the full revelation of His Beauty.  He drew closer and closer to man, until finally the day would come when He'd offer up His own life to save us from ourselves.  That God would  die  is profound, but that He would be raised again to life in order to  make His home with us  is utterly amazing.  This is the essence of, as Chesterton so perfectly described it,  the reckless, raging fury of the love of God  that has been relentlessly pursuing us since the beginning of time.    "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance...Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation." (2 Peter 3)  "On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you." (Jn 14:20)

      * a new skin for a new life.  saturday was a gorgeous day. it was the first time in a long time that i just spent some leisurely time with God, not having been beleaguered by the usual onslaught of appointments to keep and errands to run.  i went for a run in the woods in late afternoon and released a lot of pent-up, frustrated energy that had been building up all week.  it was in college that i had gotten into the habit of praying outdoors. i would wake up when the sun was just rising and run to the foothills, throwing off all my baggage with every step toward my destination. i'd find a good tree to climb, a snug branch to sit on, and pray to God as i witnessed His glory arise around me.  i felt hidden in the tree, hidden in an obscure nook of nature-- knowing that the only one who saw me and heard me was God. i've never quite shaken off the quaint notion that the best place to pray is in a tree.  i didn't climb a tree that saturday afternoon in the woods, but i did sit down with God and talk. i tried to listen. and while i didn't quite hear any "words," i did hear the soft hush of the occasional breeze sweeping through the thicket, the sound of students playing a game in the distance, the far-off barking of a dog. what i heard the loudest, however, were the moments of absolute silence, when there was no breeze, no voices, no barking. it was so evident then that God saw me, and that He loved me. it was just me and Him.  all semester i have been counting down the days to my departure, but that day, my heart ached at the thought of leaving. God took me on a long, emotional mental journey; we retraced how He had led me to Handong; we revisited all that He has led me to experience and learn and love here.  handong has spread its roots into the very earth of my being. it has been like a sheltered womb, a resting place, in which God has reknit who I am.  when I think about leaving Handong and going to the States, i realize that i am not "going back" at all. the "place" to which I am going is uncharted, formless, and mysterious; it's the real world in which the person i've become here will finally have the chance to reveal her mettle.

      i feel sick.  i've been sitting in front of this computer in my office for hours, trying to figure what i'm going to do with my life once i move to baltimore. at first i was looking at comp lit programs in the baltimore/dc area, after which i began to surf through job postings (which was incredibly depressing since there wasn't a single job that interested me in the least).  in the last hour i came back to looking at schools again, and have finally decided on something feasible.   the university of maryland has this incredible non-degree graduate program. i'd have the opportunity to take graduate level courses in spanish, latin-american lit, comp lit, and even korean, before re-applying to programs next year. it's pretty ideal, actually. it's more expensive than the city college option, but having the resources and connections of a university at my disposal is probably worth the extra cost.    *sigh* poor scott. i'm going to have to get a part-time job tutoring or something...not that it'll make much of a difference. it depresses me to think that i might be the source of financial strain on his life. it troubles me to think of depending on him for full support, not only in putting me through school, but also in paying off my undergrad debt.  what a burden i bring into the marriage! at least for the next decade, it's just going to be me, food, water, my books, and my scott. i can afford nothing extraneous; i must settle for simply the essentials. i don't think that my conscience would allow otherwise.   being at a crossroads is not easy.

      Grrr...there's something about trying on a wedding dress that makes you feel fat; you feel as if you have to go run ten miles and begin a diet of vegetables and water immediately.  *sigh* I hate being caught up in superficial things. Wedding planning seems to encourage one to obsess over inane things.   Meeting and hanging out with Paul Min last night was very refreshing.  I came away from the conversation reminded of what this life is all about.   We need to enjoy God , he kept saying. He spoke so earnestly, so thoughtfully, that I couldn't help but be as completely absorbed as he was in the beauty of Christ.  When the waiter came by to tell us that they were closing up, we were both surprised. The time had passed by that quickly.  I heard a missionary speak the other day, and his words have been haunting me...  Pray that the established, powerful places of this world be broken down.   Pray that to the hopeless, powerless places of ruin come the kingdom of God.

       From Blossoms  Li-Young Lee  From blossoms comes this brown paper bag of peaches we bought from the boy  at the bend in the road where we turned toward  signs painted Peaches.  From laden boughs, from hands,  from sweet fellowship in the bins,  comes nectar at the roadside, succulent peaches we devour, dusty skin and all,  comes the familiar dust of summer, dust we eat.  O, to take what we love inside,  to carry within us an orchard, to eat not only the skin, but the shade, not only the sugar, but the days, to hold the fruit in our hands, adore it, then bite into  the round jubilance of peach.  There are days we live  as if death were nowhere in the background; from joy  to joy to joy, from wing to wing, from blossom to blossom to  impossible blossom, to sweet impossible blossom.

      Ok, the date is set. 11/6!   Veeeerry soon.   I feel perfectly delighted, but at the same time, I feel some need to curb the excitement...with Scott's father in the condition that he is...I don't know, I guess that there are two completely dissonant cadences of anticipation pulsating under the surface.  Preparing for the wedding, bracing for his passing...  happy, sad, expectant, lonely, in love, worried, hopeful, anxious, excited, scared.

      i don't know what to write...but if i could just ask for your prayers for Scott and his family...his father is in critical care right now, fighting the cancer that has been breaking down his body for the past seven years.    i talked with him on the phone for the first time last night, and it was a surreal experience.  i haven't even met scott's dad, and here i was talking with him for ten minutes straight, without a single pause, totally omitting platitudes and pleasantries, talking about the real stuff. the deep stuff.  actually, i was pretty quiet most of the time, letting him say everything he's been meaning to say to me for a long time. it was as if his words were all there, carefully chosen, specially crafted for the day when he would meet me.  last night's conversation was not premature though; i knew that as soon as i heard his voice.   i can't take a single day for granted, mr. kim.  everyday  is a day that i could have spent with scott, a day that i could have spent with you.    what struck me as we were talking was that it was as if we knew each other. what strikes me now is the strange reality that we  do   in fact know each other.  we know each other through scott's eyes, through his heart, through his words. that both he and i are two of the people scott loves most in this world makes him our best advocate. scott has ultimately given us a picture of the other far more accurate than any first impression could have done.  it was the strangest thing listening to him: it constantly felt like i was anticipating the very next thought that came out of his mouth.  if i had the chance, i think that i could have talked to him for hours. i had a world of things to say in response to everything he had said.  i  heard  scott in his father. the patterns of thought, the strength of feeling, the careful articulation, the passionate, determined character-- all of these powerfully resonated with the deepest part of me that has already been burrowed by scott's essence...  he told me something in tears, something that i'll never forget:  scott is a different man now that he has met you. i like you because you make him happy, and i want nothing more than for my son to be happy.   i can't stop thinking about him.  his words have been echoing in my mind, bouncing back and forth between the walls of my heart, weaving their marks into my steady subconscious.  oh Lord, please  save  him. please.

      yes, i am alive and well.   and i'm finally with scott.  it's hard to describe what's it's like to be with him again. there are moments when i look over at him while we're in the car, and i still find myself astonished that he is  next  to me.  when i saw him at the airport, i realized that i had forgotten what he really looked like.  looking at a picture of scott is so different from seeing him in person, animated. it was like seeing him for the first time all over again, which wasn't so bad at all. :)  scott met my entire family in LA on Sunday, and they loved him of course.  i thought that he might be overwhelmed by them (uh...i have like 25+ relatives in LA), but he was as charming and winsome as usual.   yesterday afternoon we watched  Billy Elliot  at my aunt's house.  all we did was watch the movie and talk, but it was like finally drinking water after being thirsty for months. the sun made its way across the dome of the sky, and we didn't even notice until darkness crept into the room and we were looking at each other in the twilight. i don't ever want to take for granted that it's a special thing to be able to look at the man i love when i talk to him.  i don't ever want to forget that it's a precious thing to have the leisure of being silent together- just listening to him breathe, hearing his heart beat.

       My Last Sunday at Handong.   I was asked to give a testimony today about my experience at Handong.  It was a perfect way to reflect on this leg of the journey, and to come to a real sense of closure just as I am about to move on.  This blog was really helpful in writing the testimony; I spent a lot of time just reading old entries, and ended up copying and pasting a lot. But wow, I was very blessed while preparing for this. God showed me that He really has me in the palm of His hand.  ------------------------------------------------------------   There is a song that I particularly associate with my experience at Handong.  I sang it almost everyday when I came here alone, as a summer student, for a Korean language program in 1998.  The refrain goes like this:  I am your beloved, your creation And you love me as I am You have called me chosen for your kingdom  Unashamed to call me your own I am your beloved    Handong University was only 4 years old at the time, but it struck me even then as a very special, anointed place of God.  The students, the professors, the vision, the beauty of the campuseverything and everyone seemed to be saturated with the Holy Spirit.  During the three weeks I was here, I had never felt closer to God in my life though I was farther than I had ever been from all my friends and family.  Everyday I would go to the chapel, my heart nearly bursting with deep longing for God, and sit at the piano by myself.  As I sang my heart out to Him, I felt the pleasure and love of the Lord like never before.  I read the Word voraciously and prayed passionately, and by the end of my stay, I found myself promising God that I would follow wherever He led, no matter where in the world it was.  My first experience at Handong, you see, made me realize that God was working in and through the Body of Christ all over the world, and that as a beloved child of God, home was wherever He was.   Two years later, in the winter of 2000, I felt called to overseas missions at the Urbana Missions Conference.  A certain seminar that I attended there made me realize that I could merge my passion for studying literature with missions.  The particular vision that captured me was to strategically reach a nations future leaders by bringing the light of Christ to one of the darkest, most unreached places in the world: the university classroom.  That particular seminar set me on a trajectory toward investigating how I could fully integrate my academic field with my desire to go and make disciples of all nations.    Who wouldve known that God would bring me back to Handong, not as a student, but as a teacher, four years after my first experience here?  But He did, and in a grand full circle, He brought me back to the very place where I first pledged to follow Him wherever He led.  I sensed that coming here would somehow be a stepping-stone for me, a training ground to equip me for the ministry, but little did I know to what extent that would be true.  In the past two years, I have not only focused and honed ideas for integrating faith and learning, but I have also discovered what a joy it is to teach and to build relationships with students.    I have also experienced fellowship like I have never experienced before.  Never in my life have I met such amazing, like-minded colleagues, friends, and coworkers in Christ who have sharpened me both intellectually and spiritually.  I have had countless edifying conversations with Joyce, my officemate, and Jessica my roommate, for instance.  I have also had the privilege of seeing this Body grow from being a mere English service to being a full-on international church with covenanted members and powerful budding ministries.  I cant describe what an amazing blessing it has been to serve with the praise team, and to have prayed for this church with them and the ushers every Saturday night, for the past two semesters.  This semester, Ive been tremendously blessed by the Experiencing God Bible study as well as my accountability group, Hyo Gyung and Gloria.  And recently, Ive had the privilege of seeing one of my closest friends, Ro Potter, follow Gods calling to be the urban missionary for this church.  There are a couple specific realizations that I am taking away with me as I leave Handong and go on toward the next step.  In the next three decades or so, I want to continue to develop pedagogical methods that somehow reveal the image of God in man, and man's need for God, in my teaching of literature. This will most likely have to be an indirect approach that prods students to think about their own presuppositions and values and worldviews, in which a relational follow-up would open doors for me to share the gospel on a personal level, outside the classroom.  I would like to pursue scholarship in my field that points to Truth, redeeming in at least a small way ideas that have been corrupted by the world, trusting my Christian worldview to help me see art, beauty, philosophy, and humanity more clearly.  I am not sure to which country/ies God will lead me and my family, but please pray that wherever He leads we will follow.  When I retrace how God had led me to Handong, when I revisit all that He has led me to experience and learn and love here, I realize that Handong has indeed spread its roots into the very earth of my being. It has been like a sheltered womb, a resting place, in which God has reknit who I am.  Only time will tell the fruit that will be born of all the seeds planted here.  When I think about leaving Handong and going to the States, I realize that I am not "going back" at all. I go a changed person, and the "place" to which I am going seems uncharted and mysterious-- but thats ok, because I go forward from this place, reminded again that He has called me chosen for His kingdom, that I am not my own, that I am HIS beloved.  You are His beloved as well, and I trust that God is working in You, and that He will continue working in You, to will and to do according to His good pleasure.  God bless you!  I will be praying for you.

      "A community is never there for itself. It belongs to something greater: to the poor, to humanity, to the church, to the universe. It is a gift, a witness to offer to all. The community, those with whom we live, is only a starting point, to enable our hearts to open to this universal dimension. Community has no sense unless it is seen with its roots, its branches and its fruit.  Community can appear to be a marvelously welcoming and sharing place. But in another way, community is a terrible place. It is the place where our limitations and our egoism's are revealed to us. While we were alone, we could believe we loved everyone. Now that we are with others, we realize how incapable we are of loving, how much we deny life to others."   Jean Vanier   "Solitude is essential to community life because in solitude we grow closer to each other. In solitude we discover each other in a way which physical presence makes difficult, if not impossible. There we recognize a bond with each other that does not depend on words, gestures or actions and that is deeper and stronger than our own efforts can create. Solitude and community belong together; each requires the other as do the center and circumference of a circle. Solitude without community hurls us into a void of words and feelings."   Henri Nowen

      i am feeling so mellow today.  today is my last day of class. next week is finals, and the following week is grading/packing.  i have exactly two weeks left in beloved korea.    yesterday my students threw me a surprise party after their test.  i came in to pick up the exams at the end of the period, when lo and behold, i was suddenly greeted with a  shower of confetti and laughter and song.  as they sang me the korean "blessing song,"  i looked at the face of each and every student, realizing that, indeed, these were my last students at handong.  some of them had taken classes with me two or three times, and i was remembering what it was like when they were freshmen, or my first impressions when i had first met them.  i blew out the candles on the cake in utter amazement.  i couldn't believe that this class was throwing me a party. me, their writing teacher who doesn't even like teaching writing and who abhors grading essays.  me, the distracted person who has been so out of it and apathetic about my classes all semester. why would they want to show me appreciation? i couldn't help feeling guilty. in past semesters i had tried so hard to serve my students; i would invite them over to my place and cook for them, i would go out with them, i would bring my guitar to class and teach them songs, i would offer them multiple bible studies in english, i would counsel them when they sought advice. i was more than a teacher then.  this semester, i was simply a teacher and that's all.   later when i read the cards they had written, however, i realized that the role of a teacher in the classroom is more influential than I thought. their words told me that it was enough that I had taught them how to write and that they had improved; it was enough that i had prayed at the beginning of every class; it was enough that i came prepared to class and taught them to the best of my ability; it was enough that i showed that i cared whenever i saw them. i feel so humbled. i'm definitely no superstar, but it's God's grace that He takes pleasure in using even weak vessels.  two of the girls went out and got a gift for me on behalf of the class. i opened it in front of everyone, even though they warned me that i might not want to open it until i got home.  i told them not to be silly, that whatever they got me was worth letting everyone else see.   it was  lingerie ! pretty conservative, innocently pink, and a tad frilly, but  lingerie  nonetheless.  i was a little embarrassed at first, but ended up laughing it off when it struck me how hilarious the situation was.  everyone congratulated me on my upcoming wedding, and asked me a lot of questions about scott. that was fun, because it's always nice to talk about scott.   i love this place. i'm going to miss it.

      i've been on the east coast with scott for a week and a half now, and it's been fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;along the way&nbsp;i got engaged, met scott's father (a meeting which included a six-question interview),&nbsp;caroused with his adopted italian-irish&nbsp;family in new&nbsp;york, moved everything from my sister's place to our place (did i just say "our"?!), and befriended all scott's&nbsp;wonderful friends in new york, philadelphia,&nbsp;new jersey, and baltimore.&nbsp; the most significant thing on this trip, however, is how much more&nbsp;deeply i've come to know scott, and&nbsp;how much more profoundly i love him.&nbsp; it's one thing to&nbsp;experience love at first sight (or&nbsp;i suppose first "thought"&nbsp;or first "blog" would be more&nbsp;accurate),&nbsp;meet for six times, and then have a long&nbsp;distance relationship for five months; it's an entirely different thing to&nbsp;see that love&nbsp;play out in simple, everyday interaction,&nbsp;under the magnifying glass of mundanity.&nbsp; it's in the most prosaic of moments,&nbsp;however, that i look at scott and realize what&nbsp;a lucky woman i am. he might just be singing to himself, or talking to a friend, or laughing, or&nbsp;driving in silence, or eating, but all of it exudes&nbsp;his own uniqueness, and that i have the privilege&nbsp;of seeing&nbsp;it all continues to take me by surprise.  today's message at church was about spiritual battle.&nbsp; the speaker's main point seemed to be that spiritual battle does in fact exist, and that we need to be ready for it.&nbsp; his sermon revolved around a couple true stories that were sensationally supernatural, from visions&nbsp;to demon-possession, punctuated by&nbsp;biblical passages that encouraged us to put on the full armor of God and to resist temptation.&nbsp; That was all well and good, but I found myself waiting for... something.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was something missing from his message.&nbsp; I later realized what it was.&nbsp; The sermon was focused more on the enemy than on God.&nbsp; What about the power of God? What about Romans 8? What about the&nbsp;victory that we have in&nbsp;Christ once and for all?&nbsp; By the end of the message, I&nbsp;found myself discouraged, fearful, and self-doubting.&nbsp; I was reminded of the fact that there is a battle, but what&nbsp;my spirit&nbsp;yearns for is&nbsp;the dauntless battle-cry of David&nbsp;against Goliath, for the fearless march of Jericho, for the tenacious confidence in&nbsp;absolute victory that drove Jesus to the cross.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord I believe;&nbsp;help my unbelief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I was rebuked by this entry in Oswald Chamber's  My Utmost for His Highest :  "That I may know Him." Philippians 3:10  The initiative of the saint is not towards self-realization, but towards knowing Jesus Christ. The spiritual saint never believes circumstances to be haphazard, or thinks of his life as secular and sacred; he sees everything he is dumped down in as the means of securing the knowledge of Jesus Christ. There is a reckless abandonment about him. The Holy Spirit is determined that we shall realize Jesus Christ in every domain of life, and He will bring us back to the same point again and again until we do. Self-realization leads to the enthronement of work; whereas the saint enthrones Jesus Christ in his work. Whether it be eating or drinking or washing disciples feet, whatever it is, we have to take the initiative of realizing Jesus Christ in it. Every phase of our actual life has its counterpart in the life of Jesus. Our Lord realized His relationship to the Father even in the most menial work. "Jesus knowing . . . that He was come from God, and went to God . . . took a towel . . . and began to wash the disciples' feet."   The aim of the spiritual saint is "that I may know Him." Do I know Him where I am to-day? If not, I am failing Him. I am here not to realize myself, but to know Jesus. In Christian work the initiative is too often the realization that something has to be done and I must do it. That is never the attitude of the spiritual saint, his aim is to secure the realization of Jesus Christ in every set of circumstances he is in.

      oh it's nice to have internet access again! i haven't been able to get online for days and days now.  woohoo!  my other template was too serious and dark.  it fit my mood just before I left Korea, but now that i'm in LA, i want to look at something brighter when i upload my page.  this'll do for now.    it's difficult to describe how i am doing, but i'd say on the whole, not too well.  i've been struggling with the darkest parts of myself, which always seem to come out more in LA.  i wrote extensively about this  urlLink last summer , so i won't go into detail about it again.  but it's the same old story.  one frightening difference, however, is that i have to be here for four more months, the longest interval back at home since...since...high school?!  scott has been such an encouragement to me though; it's like a breath of fresh air to talk to him on the phone and hear about what God has been showing him lately.  from that fateful day when i first stumbled onto scott's blog, i've been a bit mystified by his relationship with God.  there's something so intensely intimate about it...he talks to God, God listens, and God speaks. he pleads with God, he cries with God, he laughs with God, he gets angry with God, and God always responds completely within His character. there are times when scott will recount to me entire conversations, which always ebb and flow like any conversation between two people.  as it should, since God is a Person.  in college, i came to a deeper understanding of and love for the holiness and beauty and sovereignty of God. i can thank friends like Chang and Darren for that. with the issues and cirumstances that i was going through at the time, it was perfect because what i needed more than anything was to see outside of myself and be overwhelmed by God.  there were lots of times when i would just be in prayer, praising Him for who He is, in all His wonderful attributes, and the shadow of my own troubles would evanesce in the resplendence of His light and grace.   but i've never experienced prayer the way scott experiences it.  i have  much  to learn from scott, but this is on top of the list: to truly interact with God as a Person- my best friend, my lover- and not only as the majestic, awesome, and overwhelmingly beautiful God of the universe.      i am in LA again for a reason, and i have to face the fact that there are just some things God needs to do in me here. we must grapple with the old ghosts of myself that waylay me at every corner; we must one by one throw out the old insecurities that cripple me every time they resurface; we must transform the old unhealthy relational patterns with family that spring from my self-centeredness and pride.   you and i, God, please.

      We had a date last night. First we went to the korean supermarket in the Galleria shopping center, and took our time wandering through the aisles, tasting samples, and filling our cart to the brim. Standing in line for the checkout, my dad suggests that we eat dinner in koreatown before going home. "Ok appa, what do you want to eat?" "I want to eat something that you might not like." "What is it?" I ask, curious. "G oat. "  I am always up for anything new and exotic, so I agreed to try it out. We headed over to the restaurant, and whaddya know, they call it yum-so-boh-shin-tang, which literally means "goat-dog-soup." Now don't worry, they weren't serving dog soup in the middle of Los Angeles. This restaurant specialty substitutes goat meat for dog meat in the traditional boh-shin-tang.  The soup was pretty good. Spicy, lots of vegetables, and a very strong broth. Goat meat definitely has a distinct flavor. I asked appa which one he preferred, boh-shin-tang or goat meat boh-shin-tang. "I've never tried boh-shin-tang, but I'm sure it tastes the same." This was surprising; I myself have eaten boh-shin-tang in Korea. "Appa, it doesn't taste the same at all. Dog is  much  better!"  I don't know, we just started laughing. The role reversal was kinda funny.

      Minette and I hung out tonight for the first time in five years. At first she seemed hardly changed-- she's still as beautiful and bubbly and funny and sweet as ever. But there's something about her now that is more confident, more grounded. What is it? I think it's that she knows what she wants out of life, is aware of realistic obstacles that might stand in the way, and yet is fully ready to face those obstacles head on. When we were in high school, it was hard to see beyond the immediate future, with classes, extracurricular activities, boy problems, and fights with our parents being more than enough to overwhelm us. What we both have now that we didn't-- or couldn't-- have in high school is  foresight . Foresight seems to be linked with self-realization, self-realization with maturity, maturity with  experience . We spent the evening going over all the significant experiences of these past five years, carefully drawing out the thrill of the watersheds and wincing at the recollection of the sloughs.  Minette and I have similar dispositions-- sunny, optimistic, loving-- so it was really interesting for me to witness how time has taken her disposition and . . . seasoned it. Somehow, she is even more beautiful a person now than she was ten years ago. When I opened the door tonight to her smiling face, her squeal, and her outstretched arms, I exclaimed, "You haven't changed at all!" But reflecting on it now, I realize that she has in fact changed a lot.  We talked about the laugh lines around our mouths and our eyes, and how they are indications of our getting-on in age. "Sandy, people like you and me are going to have more wrinkles because we smile too much." She facetiously demonstrated for me her new, wrinkle-free laugh, which looked more like a constipated Santa Claus' ho-ho. God forbid that Minette should ever lose that ebullient expressiveness in her face in the name of preservation! As those lines deepen with time, they will reveal a preservation far more beautiful than the plastic smoothness of an unaffected and un-affecting life.

      JOHN CHI PLAYED 8 HOURS OF PLAY STATION TODAY, NON-STOP, IN HIS BOXERS AND UNDERSHIRT. HE DID NOT BRUSH HIS TEETH, NOR DID HE EAT.  I WONDER WHETHER OR NOT HE EVEN USED THE BATHROOM.  I am in awe of my brother. I think that he deserves some reward. Maybe he can make it into the Guiness Book of World Records!

      there are some days when i feel like i can't do anything right, so i don't want to do anything at all.  there are other days, like today, when i feel like i can do so many things that i can't focus.  and then there are the good days, when i wake up and know exactly how i am going to spend the day and why i'm going to spend it that way.  it seems as if the "good" days are becoming less and less frequent, while the "some" and the "other" days are becoming standard fare.  i think that i need to volunteer my time somewhere.  i need to serve others.  this complete focus on myself and my own life is starting to seem terribly absurd.  i had been toying with the idea of making some money and getting a part-time job, but now that i think about it, i think that it would only worsen what's wrong with my state of mind right now.
