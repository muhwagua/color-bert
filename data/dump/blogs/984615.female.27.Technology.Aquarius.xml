Tomorrow is the biggest shopping day in all of America.

       'kay I have just submitted myself to a social-less life. I'm ready to give in to the wonder that is the 'net and kow-tow to it's awsomeness.   I bring it up because I've just counted and I have (at this very minute) 5 e-mail accounts; 2 blogs; 2 (or 3) on-line dating references; 3 web communities; 2 or more (some I may have neglected) BBSes that I subscribe to. 2 personal websites.   I thought that the point to technology was to make life easier and here I am making my life more complicated by not engaging in it at all. how awful is that?   stuff like "Go see my  urlLink page " end up in more than just my e-mail communications. Its getting scary.  my eyes are glazing over from the monitor glare

               you have an ominosity quotient of:  seven. you are as ominous as the creators of this quiz. which terrifies us.    find out your ominosity quotient .         Is there even such a thing as "ominosity?" 'Cause I know that I'm  urlLink ominous , Always have been, but to have an "ominosity quotient" doesn't seem right, does it?     *Laughing Manically*

      ahhh... the trails and tribulations of holiday family gatherings.   Actually its not all that stressfull. Thankfully most of the drama is reserved for the christmas tree decorations. Thank God I'm jewish. I think that if I were to do something horrible during the set-up when it comes time for the trial that I could claim instanity because of Zionism. I only mention it because I remember a few years back there was an incident of a man who had stabbed his daughter to death over the decoration of their christmas tree. lord knows I've felt that way especially when mom has wanted to shove a freakin tree into my car when I had a perfectly fine roof rack to put the F*ckin tree on.  Other than that days have been rolling on - alcohol soaked as ever. Especially when eurotrash is involved. After this is all passed on I don't know if I'm going to remember what happened or has been happening these past few month.   - There is a new bar in my flat now. Its looking more and more like a bordello every day. Either that or a speakeasy. I've been considering becoming a madam. I mean...hell! why the fuck not. I got a house of men, all of them eligible and very good looking, and I know a growing pool of girlfriends who are always complaining about how it seems like there are no good men "left."   Actually that idea is probably not something I should honestly be considering with any seriousness. Although I won't lie, the idea is enticing. If only to keep the upper-hand on all my "mens"    *Quietly giggling to herself*

        I've got such a bathroom sense of humor. Its awful - according to someone else. Personally I think that its a touch more masculine that I should enjoy, but then again the whole idea of gender roles is a false construct created to keep people miserable.   - I'm regressing and I think that its not an alltogether good thing. I find that I'm searching out all of that crap that I once rejected while growing up much too fast. Maybe that or I'm trying seriously hard to avoid the inevitability that I'm getting older. (not that I'm an old hag, not by a long shot)  Still...weddings, babies, christenings, bris-es, and other landmarks keep hurtling towards me at a lightening speed that makes even my head spin.   Am I so ego-istic that I'm sacrificing my grandness on just my self?  - Could I have a BIGGER ego?

      Actually I've still got the giggles from a most hilarious story that I heard while on the road:  Friend of a friend had several job interviews in a day. To keep his voice from cracking and his mouth from being overly dry while interviewing he had drunk lots of water. During the course of the day he was so nervous, and had timed the interviews so closely that he did not have enough time to break for the bathroom. At the end of the second interview he was desperate to go to the bathroom. There was a bathroom in the second office, but all of the stalls were in use. He couldn't wait for use of the stalls - he needed to go so bad - so the next best thing was the sink.    Without delay he whipped it out and began to relieve himself...well he was so pent up with the stress and pressure of needed to urinate for the past couple of hours that the release   made him pass out.   he was found a few moments later on the floor of the mens bathroom, passed out, pants down hand on himself and lying in a puddle.   - needless to say he didn't get that job.  It doesn't do it justice to retell it in type...it is much better told in person...Honestly I nearly lost it on Sunday past while at a resturant drinking a Freakin Huge soda, just imagining my roadies passed out on the floor from the sheer pleasure of relieving themselves.   *teehee*

       ooph. I went snowboarding for the first time in my life, and quite possibly the last. Although fun, and good for me - in true kizzy form I managed to hurt myself. I should have known better than to push myself on the first day of the ski season when the mountains are icy and not really primed for traversing.   I took an edge and the lip of my rented snowboard dug in. I "cacked" it (a british-ism for flubbing/falling/hurting onself - trust me it sounds cool with the accent) and did an amazing twisting flip midair. But when I landed I felt and heard a pop in my right knee and now I'm hurting and limping all over the place. I fear that I might need to go to the orthopedic surgeon to take care of it. Not something I'm looking forward to again, one massive reconstructed knee later and I'm limping and hurting every freaking winter. Now to only hurt my right knee as well.  The road trip was worth it. no sleep and tons of laughs...the way a road trip should be.

       I've been ranting a lot recently. Come to think of it I have very little to rant about. But that doesn't seem to stop me. Either I'm very stubborn, or just very stupid. Someday I might just get the point and see that ranting about all this hullabaloo isn't going to do me any good other than to just allow me to vent some of my many pent up frustrations at the world, and my complete lack of understanding as to why it has to all turn out this way.  I suppose that it all started when i was a little girl....

      having effectively forsworn any activities that are productive....I am still at work. futzing around online. HA. da' Man should have known better.   but then again "he" was never really that smart. Serves "him" right for creating Mosaic in the first place and trying to make money off of it. *teehee*  I am in lovely-freakin-wet Portland,OR. ("or what?" should be your question, my answer..oops don't have one 'spose thats 'cause I don't have an "or" to be at right now.) This traveling stuff sucks sometimes. I miss traveling with friends and fun people. When its me and the suits...suits are boring by nature, and I never considered myself a suit. I'm not a drinker only socially (and when I am in my room late at night with the lights down and I'm sobbing into an empty bottle of wine....oops...damn...inside my head voice...inside my head voice.) And If you haven't been on the business circut lately the people that I'm working with and seeing are far from the hang-out at a bar type. Definetly NOT the type you take out on the town to have fun.  ugh...I do not like me sometimes. So RASBERRIES to you!

      hunger is taking over...ugh. I have got a cracking headache and I know that it has to do with the fact that I haven't eaten anything since 6 am this morning. Its now 1 pm and my blood sugar is dipping dangerously low. It's about time for the bitch to come out and play. I should really shove something into my mouth. (I've really got some very strange oral fixations, don't I?) Another roommate is now contemplating leaving...our happy little dysfunctional-orgiastic-sadistic-family is falling apart. What's a girl to do? And why is it that suddenly Paris is so fucking alluring. It fuckin' 20 degrees and  uuuugggghhhhaaaleeee  in the autumn/winter. No more culture than here?!?! I'll miss him if he goes. Good 'Ol Chap that he is. must...find...sustance...girle...needs...food. *Thud*

      So much DRA-MA! more drama than is really necessary - Eurotrash is visiting...and of course I thought that all was good, but "eurotrash is as eurotrash does." but not the both of them - one of them is really cool but the other is just not having it, and so made the weekend crap. That and I was having indigestion from all that crap I shoved in my tummy. I felt really cooped up because of the weather and I spent the entire weekend inside. I did get free preview passes for the new movie " urlLink Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets " - not bad but LOOOOONNNNGGGG! clockin in at nearly 3 hours. My ass started to hurt at the 2 hour mark. But then I've read the book - not bad for a kids book. quick easy afternoon/beach read. it [the movie] does some justice to the text, but the book was relatively detailed to begin with - a little short of character development since that was for the most part covered in the first book. All the same it does make me want to read the next book in the series...if only because I'm going to be airborne myself today.   That was one of those dreams that I had when I was a kid - to be a witch or have majical powers and have the ability to make others do my willing - or rather have the natural world under my control....hmmm  Shazam!!

      Okay...inside day.and I haven't done that in awhile. Not that I wouldn't have perferred to get out and explore the great outdoors...It was a family thing, so it meant that food and food and more food was included. I hurt now. My tummy is disended. I feel so anti-ethiopian. And it's only served to make me feel lethargic and pitiful. Inside all freakin day! I live in the freakin big city, and what do I do but stay indoors on a lovely day.   This house, my house is At the very moment empty except for myself, otherwise there are now 7 people here. It feels so hyper-dramatic - so "real world-ian" that it's strange. Normally there are only 4 men and then me. The lone house-frau. Not to say that I don't enjoy having people vist, always a good experience to show-off but at the same time, I'd enjoy having the place to myself. yet at the same time I'm sorry to see one of them go - the good one. Damn!

      is it wrong to really like Justin Timberlake's music? I feel dirty, and not the good kind of dirty - sort of betrayer kind of dirty. Like I've been lying kind of dirty.   But I've gotta give the boy props...this new album....Which   have NOT purchased  but have sampled    urlLink courtesy of MTV's first listen    Heck, even Miss Janet is getting down with the boy. (I can't blame her either - if you got it go for it!!)   he's actually goin for the real grove - and lots of sounds that are obviously influenced by the greats  Stevie Wonder  in particular. Which really wants to make me take out all of  LP's  and park my butt on my carpet and rock-out in my room - like old times...  "She's a Bad-mamma-jamma"

       WHAT!?!?  I can't even check my e-mail while futzing around at a client site! Firewalls and Blocked mail sites! What in the heck do people think we're trying to do here, freakin work? Nuh-uh!! not me.   Okay, this was the plan - I was going to totally relate this great chat session that I had with a friend of mine "D-Love" but the text of it was waaayyyy too long to include here. I suggest that you read it - one of my new personal favorite stories - and TOTALLY TRUE! this Shiznit is better than fiction. (Life usually is anyway.)    So if you're cool enough to handle it - take a minute to  urlLink read this  and you'll understand why I am so  ABSOLUTELY  not cool  It gets to the nudity and the group orgys towards the middle of the story. (I always come through don't I - orgys and nudity - who could ask for more!) And I promise that I have at least 4 people to corrborate the story as absolutely true. (why would I lie!)  - chillin like a villian

      Okay - so I spent most of the afternoon trying to figure out how in the heck I would post this great - farcical image of  urlLink Bush - version 2   on this blog -only to fail miserably. I haven't done any HTML or Java for that matter in over 3 years. I am so freakin out of it anyway. My FTP situation is horrible. (read - I can't afford a good one so I'm relegated to crap free services) And on top of all of that – I’m tired and hung-over from last night.    Actually a moderately entertaining story – not worthy of a full retelling but possibly the juicy tidbits.   Birthday celebration at a campy piano bar in the big city…too much alcohol consumed by the birthday girl…obligatory outbursts by the birthday girl…a playful mauling at the table by Italian men…1 AM on a (now Thursday morning) I was ready to call it quits, but had just met a George Clooney Clone - and he was decidedly interested in me, even with the "on-me-like-a-cheap-suit" italian-mauler/man.   &mdash;Then it began to rain. not bad for a Wednesday Night/Thursday Morning.

       urlLink This  is where I started, but Here may be where I end up. I must rant: so much for civic duty. a freakin drop in the bucket and look what happens. I go and I vote and still the evil empire wins. makes it fee really futile.   Enough: the point was this; I think I'm interesting and that I have some insight to my world around me. Lord knows I've lived in my own world long enough  - Time to introduce YOU to it as well. This is the beginning of something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. (Wait I'm not married!)  Odd how an egotistical defense of  urlLink solipsism  can turn into self righteous rants for the whole world to see.   a little  urlLink tautological , no?

      I should know better than to travel with family. Oh damn was that a mistake. Matricidal impulses surged through me after the first 12 hours.    I'm actually surprized that I lasted that long. Needless to say the whole point of the trip was for me to gain a wholesome (and envying) winter suntan. Of which I did manage to get a little darker, but no thanks to the family unit of which I had to spend nearly every waking hour with. I don't know how you can spoil heaven, but it was defintely a little frayed around the edges.   there is a quote I've come across which could not have said it better:   Maybe there is no hell. Maybe hell is listening to your grandparents eat sandwiches while they breath through their noses.  truer words could not have been spoken.     And if you don't know, now you know! WHoooYahhh!

      I only mention it here, because there are times in our lives when our brains can trick us into believing in something so much that we can delude ourselves into "feeling" it. But this dream was so vivid. It was unreal how I could feel myself walking, talking, moving through space. Through a space that I have never been in before, nor likely will ever see. It is possible that it was just my mind trying to re-hash old memories, but at the same time it was more than a memory. My senses were involved to the point that I could smell the musty room, I could tell you now in explicit detail the colors of the walls, the feel of the carpet under my feet.   It was more like a premonition of what I'd like to have happen. But I'm not beyond saying that I've had dreams like this before, and they were premonitions about specific times, places and people. I normally don't subscribe to "sixth sense" BS, but it's been happening to me more and more frequently. It was especially odd when I "knew" that I'd meet one of my very best friends before I ever knew of her. It could explain how we became such good friends so quickly. hmmm.

      this past weekend was a blur. Thank god I am not an alcoholic. but If you can hand me that beer over there....   Was in Washington DC and drank, ate and was trying to be merry. Only I dont think I drank enough to be merry. Maybe I was jolly, but not merry.  Thursday night: A fishbowl of rum/gin punch started me out. I don't remember getting into bed, but I was woken up at 5 am by a very annoying alarm clock. Friday: Most of the day...pretending I wasn't drunk/hungover. Then, YAY! drinks galore! A hosted bar at my company party. Needless to say..I don't remember much of the meal, but the drinks were free. (really thats all that matters.)   Saturday: we aren't talking to each other right now. Then later...more drinking! and dancing, yay!   Dunday: flying home...drinking in business class!   what's the diffrence between alcoholics and drinkers...Drinkers aren't quitters

      I was "stream of Conciousness" writing this... Its the edited version since it is truly boring.  I am again on another airplane, and I find that I am again struck by the Seminole beauty of the passing landscape. The light glinting off of the lakes of water and the mountains rising above the clouds. For the first time I saw what it might have been like thousands of years ago when a great inland lake filled the central valley of California. Vast and terrifying. If only for its awesomeness.   - Okay so I’m waxing poetic about landscape that I know is not really a matter of great importance to many. But every once in awhile it does take my breath away just because of the pure surprise that it has. I know that I don’t every feel like saying that I am blesses. But those moments…there are moments when you don’t realize it and they come upon you and the only acceptable emotion might be to cry. And even now I find that I am tearing simply at the sight of things that I have already-often seen from afar.   - Possibly the reason why I am so emotional is because of the sense of lost opportunity? Or maybe it could be simply out of fear. Fear of that something that I don’t have any faith in…lord knows that I don’t have faith in my own abilities. Never have, and I suppose that my laziness may overtake my will to someday aspire to greatness. I suppose that I am just recently struck with the fear that I have no original ideas, and that my own desire for originality has faded into a rote daily chore or normalcy, simply because of laziness.   - Watching the air trail of the previous airplanes that have just passed by this route, I suppose that I feel unoriginal. (Maybe it could just be that we’ve passed by most of the sierra Madre and are about to pass into the Great Plains.) All that vast flatness. How could that inspire any striking images, other than its lack thereof of topography? (God I sound full of myself don’t I) In comparison to the rest of the nation…so blank but I suppose in the same vein absolutely ripe for more…the unoriginality idea…what do I have to say that has not already been said by someone more eloquent and talented? I suppose being haunted by my father’s ghost, and his terrible failures I have a right to be skeptical of my abilities to surpass him. Possibly it could be my mother’s ill health, and her constant stories of “almost” discovery. I’ve been let down too often not to expect that I cannot be all things to anyone other than myself.   But at the same time isn’t it acceptable to believe in your own abilities? I know that I’m not a fool. That it’s not easy to make anything of yourself in a modern world crushed by people who are talented and determined. More determined and lucky than me. Truthfully I don’t think that I am so much more different than others in their desire for acceptance and reward?

       Man Sentenced for 'Burning Bush' Comment  By Associated Press December 6, 2002, 2:37 PM EST SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A man who made a remark about a "burning Bush" during the president's March 2001 trip to Sioux Falls was  sentenced Friday to 37 months in prison.    Richard Humphreys, of Portland, Ore., was convicted in September of threatening to kill or harm the president and said he plans to appeal. He has said the comment was a prophecy protected under his right to free speech.   Humphreys said he got into a barroom discussion in nearby Watertown with a truck driver. A bartender who overheard the conversation realized the president was to visit Sioux Falls the next day and told police Humphreys talked about a "burning Bush" and the possibility of someone pouring a flammable liquid on Bush and lighting it.   "I said God might speak to the world through a burning Bush," Humphreys testified during his trial. "I had said that before and I thought it was funny."

      OKay, Travel has its way with me yet again.  1. I must mention that I normally love the southwest, (As I can be considered almost part of it.)  2. Arizona is a lovely state, geographically and topographically  3. Phoenix is hell.   Not to be unfair to those friends of mine who do live there, I will admit to having a cold and that my reasons for visiting Phoenix were not for pleasure. Had they been, I might most assuredly had a better time. However I was in the said "hell" for business and as such that means that my abilities to live it up are limited to what I can eek out of my time after 8 + hours in a glass and steel monolith. Needless to say...I was indoors and suffered at the hands of modern science.   *read as: I hate Air Conditioning  Aside from that Phoenix (which I do regard as a lovely town) looked more and more like the "Pure Hell Hole" that is Los Angeles. Smog and Heat only functioning to provide stunning sunsets which blaze across the setting sky.   All that said..the trip went well. I now have a head cold and skin cancer.*   just joking 'bout the skin cancer...black don't crack. and thankfully rarely burns.

      Okay, This is the deal. I have no deal. Lately it is oddly quiet. I find that I am listlessly floating about my days. This is an odd sense of.... mediocrity? I've never been here before and this is something that I am not used to. I have a day-to-day which is everything but day to day, yet I've managed to do nothing interesting. This is not my passion, this is NOT my bliss, but I have no concept of what my bliss could be. I'm lazy and I've extremely high expectations of myself yet I don't have the drive to follow through with any of the ideas that I have swirling around in my head.  -"i want to write the next great american novel' -"i want to compose the next soul-searching pop hit" -"i want to become a world famous singer/songwriter, and still have credibility for authenticity" -"i want ....." I don't have a clue of what I want. All I really know is that I don't want what i've got to the same degree that I know that I deserve more than what I have. But in the same breath I know that whatever I get as a result of ditching what I have will mean that I might regret it.   - I shouldn't live with regret. But so far I regret nothing...and I'm doing okay. does that mean that I'm narcissistic? or just stupid?

      *sniff* Raiders lost. badly. I had such high hopes that they might win. But that said I honestly wasn't paying that much attention to the game simply because I was still recovering from Friday night...whooo hooo!! It is also the main reason why I do NOT have parties at my home. Nasty-ness ground into my already funky carpet only serve to remind me of the fact that I have a very grimy and slap-shot home. Ah well. 'tis the life of a busy working girl...But so far my birthday has been very good to me...Although I do have blisters forming on my fingers...  - dirty boys....I've got the blisters because I got a guitar for my birthday. I'm learning to play solo guitar....*tisk, tisk* dirty minds all ya'll

      I smoke in dark corners. I have a favorite spot where I smoke my borrowed cigarettes with the lights off so that no one can see me. I don't relish the cigarette like others do. I hate the smell of it. I hate that smoking alone makes me feel guilty; i hate that I'm not addicted to cigarettes either so I cannot write off what I am doing to mere compulsion.   It is the spot just behind the pantry on the way down to the garbage cans. It is the one spot in the house that no one thinks to look if the lights aren't on. Yet it is near the most heavily trafficked rooms in the house.  It is a compunction that I haven't quite figured out entirely.Maybe I want to get caught so that I can find a reason to stop.   Like tonight. I had to eat. I did more than eat. I filled myself. Beyond a point when I knew I should have stopped, I kept eating simply because the food was there and no one else was.  I was full and my belly was disdended with all of the food I shoved in my mouth, but I couldn't stop. The whole time I could imagine my fathers voice in my ear. "You'd be so much prettier if you were thin."   I am the big girl. I am that pink elephant in the room. Loud, bright, and impossible to ignore, yet I am invisble. For a long time I was very used to accepting my invisibility. Now I scream for attention when I can. Big curly hair that stands on end, horned rimmed tortise-shelled glasses that accent my almond eyes, big full lips, nothing I do has hidden my features. Yet I could hear a pin drop every time; to the rest of the world I am mute. For all my screaming all I have is a sore thoat.   i want to say that I am done. This is my announcement that I am through. But I know that it isn't the case. I love who I am. I'm not a pariah, nor leper. But if I am a pink elephant then so be it. I only want you to notice that I am the pink elephant. Would that be too much to want to be acknowledged that an elephant, no matter the color or size is still a nobel and beautiful creature? Or will you only ever try to look through that elephant to see some raggedy swan entering a room with its loud honking call for attention?

      can I say that I would love to be in love with  urlLink dave eggers ... He is a giraffe amounst a sea of pathetic lemmings. I am envious and spiteful about the fact that "he" has national acclaim as an artist and writer and general former of a "new" zeigeist for the "x-generation." Thankfully though I have NO reason to be jealous. He is humble and he is  urlLink very philantropic .   of course its always easier to be nobel when you have money.   But I will say this. He is a  urlLink fucking awsome writer .   **edit...I had to edit  urlLink this dialouge . For Truth in advertising's sake...that and to prove to the world that I have to be the biggest drunken dork there is in the Bay Area.

      A good weekend. Although It was a little weak on the sleep and rest and restoration side. As a result I am still sick. This is an unfortunate consequence of not abiding by my new years resolution of "staying dry" for the month of January.  I really should learn to set more realistic goals like:   1. do not pick your nose in public.   2. Smile when you cannot think of something to say instead of babbling non stop.   3. The topic of conversation does not need to be all about you. No matter how boring the other persons story is.  4. Be kind to your elders.(at least try to be kind to your elders for at least 20 consecutive minutes. )  5. While at work, do not look at porn. Or at least wait until everyone is out of the office before you look at porn  Actually I don't think that I'd be to succesful at keeping those either.

      ugh...I have a cold. I should be home in bed, but I spent most of yesterday in my bed just sweating out this damn cold.    I hate being sick, if only because there is this feeling that I have rely on others to help me. I hate that feeling more than anything else. I know that I have control problems. No amount of time will be able to change that   I say that now  and I don't suspect that Its helping me get any better.   New Topic: Reality TV...I never thought that 12 years ago the small genre that was MTV's "Real Worls" would mushroom into the atomic disaster that it is today. As of today (January 10th, 2003) there are currently 20 reality TV shows out there (rough estimate) half of them I've never even watched (okay I have watched a good majority of them) and the other half are a guilty pleasure that I feel I shouldn't be indulging in. Its beginning to feel like bear-baiting. "Lets throw these 20  unsuspecting  women at a 28 year old man whom it posing as a millionare when really he's living at the poverty line." what the hell kinda show is that, yet I'm absolutely riveted and locked into my television.  Or there is the newest one where we move away from the "regular-joe" reality into the B stars.  urlLink The surreal life  is a horrible train wreck waiting to happen. But I can't look away. I feel like I'm going to burn out my retina's if I watch. but....I.....just.....cant......look......away

      OH MY GWAD!!!! I've managed to whittle away most of my day being stupid and reading an even sillier Bulletin board about nothing of great importance. What's happened to my drive?   On top of all that some more major changes have happened at my company. I'm a little scared. At the same time I'm confident that from here on out that I've got not that much to worry about. Hopefully. I think.   damn. Who in the hell does that fool think he is....some random in an office next to mine thinks that I'm his personal bitch. I'm fucking busy multi-taskin my lazy ass off. I Ain't doin shit fo you fool....  - to mention new items...I was listening to NPR yesterday and it turns out that Bush Jr. has managed to very serriptiously appoint a pro-life doctor to the NIH...and although he had originally wanted to appoint him the director he's still managed to get enough twists and turns into it that instead of the director (which thankfully was shot down by congress) he's appointed him to a board that has veto power and committe designation administration....Shit. Now I'm really fucked. I knew that unless I had I dick I'd be fucked after that last election debacule.  - so what If I can't spell....I'm a publik skool kid.

I was supposed to be in portland today. I went a little apeshit at breakfast ranting about how this didn't feel right. I was up much too early and was pacing about the fact that I was not in portland. shit.   I suppose that after I've got all this other shit done I'll get started on looking for work. I think I'll be calling alot of my old clients...

      What I have learned since monday; 1. NEVER EVER buy anything online with your checking debit card.  2. ALWAYS keep your recipts for the expensive items 3. trust no one.   I got e-robbed. More literally I got e-raped. Some one, we don't know who (but if I ever find you I hope and pray to god that Amnesty International never finds out what I'm going to do to you) stole all my money. ALL OF IT. I am now "Officially" piss poor. The fucked up thing about it is because I belong to a smaller bank and not one of those monster-conglomerates they're going to treat this as an ATM error and not as fraud, which it is. So that means that I don't get my money back in 3 to 4 weeks. It of course fucks up all my plans that I did have to visit the LA area so that I could stalk my favorite stars, drive drunken down Hwy 1 and get plastic sugery.  fuck. This fucking sucks. But on the bright side of it all I got some free drinks out of my friends.

She fuckin rocks....Literally. She was kickass. I cannot in words literally express how much she rocked my socks. Nevermind the fact that she played a 4 hour set with only a miniscule 15 minute break.

      oh god.  this is horrible, simply because it only reminds me of our fallability which wages war against our innate desire to move beyond the known world.   I remember the challenger.  urlLink I will remember the columbia.   It is a horrible thing that our faith in technology can only take us so far and so much rests on pure chance.   I'm sorry. I don't mean to prostletize my luddite tendencies, its just I get this feeling like we (as an organism) are pushing beyond what we are capable of doing. That technology has only provided the means to more, but we have not had the opportunity to all learn from what we have been given. I could lie and say that I wished for a simpler time, but that isn't possible. I was moved to tears when I was listening to NPR this morning.   Rick Husband was the commander of the space shuttle columbia. He had always wanted to be an astronaut. It was his dream, it was his goal, since he was 4 years old. He applied 4 times before he was accepted to NASA. Until later in life he became to realize that being an astronaut was not the ultimate goal. The day before he was to leave on his mission he recorded a video tape which was replayed at his memorial. The gist was that he had come to the realization that being an astronaut was not his goal. He was to be a good and loving father, a good and loving husband and a glowing example of what a good man could be.   Peace be with you, Columbia shuttle crew.

      Okay, This is the "big day" I'm leaving for the hospital in about a half an hour. I remember the first surgery that I had for my left knee. I don't remember much of the first week. But once the drugs wore off, and I sobered up, man. That was not fun.   I'm trying to console myself with the idea that this will bring more symmetry to the aesthetics of my legs. (So what if I can't spell, you get the drift) The last time it was really difficult, simply because I "knew" that I might never speak to my friends again. and in part I was somewhat correct. The friends that I had made such close bonds with and had expected to be there forever were not. I had invested so much into them and had expected so little. But ironically enough it was the people with whom I had not expended nearly the same amount of care and love had really wowed me. They were the ones whom gave back more than I could have ever expected and with whom I am still friends with to this day. I suppose that with hindsight the "friends" (and I use the term as loosely as possible) that I had loved and cared about were really some of the most selfish people I had met. All of the extra energy that I was using up was simply because it was so hard. I thought that all that extra work meant that I was a great friend. Now I can see that it was them and not me, otherwise when I was rehabilitating the first time I would have seen them, would have heard from them.   I suppose that I'm just thinking that I'm lucky that this time around I know that this is not going to cause such rifts. I've already had such a warm outpouring of support and love that I'm feeling okay.   -geeze. One long heck of a way to say that "I'm OK" I'll be okay. I'm a little anxious, but more about the coming home and starting the rehabilitation than anything else. Only because I know that it's going to be painful. But lucky me, I get a hottt guy to "work me good" hahahahah. To bad that it will be about two weeks before I'll probably see him again. He's really nice, but the problem lies in the fact that he's NOT interested and that he's my physical therapist. Although he'd be cool to hang around with. I suppose that I'll have to broach the subject later in the rehab, but he'd be cool....of that I'm pretty sure.  -On another note: i am scared out of my mind that I'll go under and when I get out we'll be in the midst of world war III. I'm not looking forward to it if only that since 9/11/01 there is the knowledge that "we" are vunerable and that we may be a target.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed. You should do the same.

      to try and lighten the mood because I've been down lately...  this was a picture taken more than a few months ago. Needless to say it was the result of drunken debauchery, only this time someone had a camera...that and well...this match went on for a while.       actually this picture isn't true to life. 2 seconds later I had flipped him and had "pippo" pinned and calling out for mercy.....hahahahaha. oddly enough his mercy cry was "I'm farting, I'm farting"...you had to be there.

      Okay. I got back from the doctors. It turns out that in my unflailing good sense of bad karma I managed to really fuck up my right knee. It turns out that I'll need surgery. It will be outpatient, but it will be for three procedures seeing that I managed to completely fuck up the cartilage in my knee with a "bucket tear" and a "simple" tear with both the right and left portion of the cartilage. Basically the bone from the fib-tib is sitting right on top of each other which is why I am in such terrible pain all the time. (no thanks to the drugs.)  so It'll be surgery for me. fuck. fuck. fuck, fuckety fuck.  I'll be going under the knife 3/19/03. so if you don't hear from me in two weeks...I'm probably dead.

      but now that I've Managed to fuck things up even more....damn. Life sucks and if you're lucky you get a painless death. - I dislocated/broke my right knee now. fuck.  I only had one good knee left to work with and I managed to go and fuck that shit up too.   Here's the deal: It was last thursday (2/27) when I was out with the usual suspects. Of course there was alcohol involved, but I was being good as I didn't want to get trashed. it was a good night, and I have to admit that I have never seen my roommate that shit-faced, ever. it was funny. I was happy. I was having a good time...so I was skipping, and generally being silly. so naturally I thought that it would be the perfect opportunity to do my version of Monty Python's Flying Circus' - Ministry of Silly Walks. Thats what did it. I was mid-goose step/hop and then I came down wrong. Although I never knew that there was as right way to have a silly walk, but now I do.  Fuck it hurt. And it didn't help that it sobered me up immediately. Unfortunatley it didn't sober up the rest of the crew. They were all pretty much still shitfaced as shitfaced as you can be.  so I went home, hobbled up my stairs and tried to sleep. I haven't really slept well since.

      life sucks, and then IF you're lucky you get to die a quick painless death.   - I don't suspect that I'll ever be that lucky. For those of you who care, and I doubt that there are many of you out there; I got word back from the law school that I applied to. I didn't get in. That and last night the beach bonfire I helped to host, well I had to leave BEFORE the freggin DJ's showed up unexpectedly. DAMN!!!  DAMN my god damned knees. I fucking wonder why god has it out for me sometimes. It is as if I am some real life sissiphus. I have ever only gotten so far...only to be crushed by some crap circumstance. Or maybe it could be the simple fact that I'm lazy... oh who cares. I'm bored. I think I'll go watch some TV.

       Living life is important, but it still hurts now that he's gone. I will miss him, because he made me laugh without any worries  and smile without fear. I love you Mr David Cocking of the UK.  R.I.P.  he died in an accident, not associated to alcohol but freakishly while he was busy with the work of life. I will miss him for the purely selfish reason all people do when someone dies. I will miss him simply because I do not get the chance, spark, the moment of inspiration that every person brings into your life. But I will miss him most because he made my life bright. he made it fun. he made it worthwhile. I wanted to spend so much time with him if only to see what would happen next.     My mother is going to the funeral, Unfortunately I cannot attend. I am still recouperating from the surgery of only two weeks ago. Its odd that this is the second time someone close to me has passed after a knee surgery. I want to believe that it's coincidence, but I'm to superstitious to not think that its not related. Christ. It will be awhile before I can laugh again like that.

I know that we'll keep in touch, and that there is no doubt in my mind that we'll always remain friends, its just the idea that I don't get to keep something special with him that no one else had. I got to live with him. I got to be a part of the paddy-party 24/7. damn.   I just have to keep reminding myself that I'll see him in 10 days time. 10 days time. 10 days time.

      okay. Now I'm better than I was before.   its difficult to have to re-evaluate what you've been planning for. To have that rug yanked from under. Law school/grad school/ advanced degree was the plan...now its not. I have to start over and then just step back into the rushing throng of the day to day life that I used to have. Unfortunately that day-to-day life sucks and is incredibly dreary.   Changing subjects: I just got back from a 5 day road trip with two friends, and although it was refreshing...now I'm left with the feeling like it wasn't long enough. Damn my employed friends for being responsble. This is the one time in my life when I have shit to do and the last thing on my mind is to stay put. Regardless. 5 days, 3 states, 9 national parks/monuments. Fuckin awesome. It only makes me want to go back and do it all again... possibly with a little more time in Northern New Mexico...less of it spent on the 666 highway...and yes there is a  urlLink 666 highway.  I shit you not...we broke down there. Talk about odd coincidence.  But the rest of the trip was filled with inside jokes, flatulence, snoring and lots and lots of sex talk...(I was the only girl.)  I'll get to the details and the images later. I'm too bored with the retelling of it all to try and justfy it right now with detailed explinations of wasteless ideas.

      It was a very long day June 6th, 2003. But  (and if the links for the photos worked you could see how cute I looked regardless of the grime.)  notice that we're still smiling...I think it was out of mere exhaustion and surprise. After 20 + hours of train travel (all due to the French train strikes, thank you very much!) We (along with 3 others) all arrived at our planned destination (Octon, France) at approximately 10:30 pm. Approximately 20 hours after we had left from Verona, Italy. The trip via train is only supposed to take 12 hours. I'm surprised that we were even able to sit up, let alone smile about it and have a drink of wine for dinner.  But it was all definitely worth it. The entire point of the trip was for a friends wedding. A whole day affair in the bucolic landscape of the Languedoc region of southern France. The image below is from the garden of a lovely abbey where we had an all day reception and party for the happy couple. The church in the center of the photo was where the two got married in an all French ceremony (where incidentally 1/2 of the attendants didn't speak a word of French.)The entire wedding party didn't consist of more than approximately 70 people, but it could not have been the more perfect size for the occasion. Kids, adults and friends alike all danced, sang and had a great time, until they kicked us out around 2 am. (the food wasn't bad either...mmmm foi grais)  *edited 'cause the freakin pics weren't loading and I'm too lazy to try and load them to a secured server

      This is supposed to be a mark on the wall to note a progression. At least that is what these "journals" or logs are supposed to commemorate. You re-read them in a moment of self indulgence and then you are supposed to look whimsically back upon the life lessons that you've learned from that point in your life.  But I guess I missed that day in school. I never was good at my lessons.   I'm exactly where I was about 8 years ago. But without the benefit of 100 miles distance and a couple of dollars in my pocket. 8 years ago was shite. and I thought that I would never have to live through something like that again. now granted this is not exactly like what happened then, but its still is not great. I'm not thinking clearly, (although I suppose that I never did) and I continue to have delusions of some victorian ideal... some silly made up story in my head that I'm desperately trying to convince myself is real. Good lord I'm so lame.

      I've been avoiding what needs to be done. Procrastination is so easy that before you know it a whole day has slipped away. Since feburary my life has been in a holding pattern. I've had really no other alternative. I was afraid that this would happen to me, as it was exactly what happened to me the last time that I injured myself.     you forget how much you value independence until you can no longer savor it  Then again, this was a real test, last time, to see who were the people in my life that I could depend upon. Unfortunately it wasn't who I'd hoped it would be, infact they were the ones that had let me down the most. (this was back in 1996) It was the strange feeling that I had been ripped from a life that I had only begun to formulate as an individual. This time it wasn't the same, but I was still incredibly fearful that I might be "end" of some very dear relationships. And the fact that it was in reality an ending of some sort. I had been 'fired'; I had no money; One of my dearest friends was leaving the country...potentially never to return. I think that most people with just these items alone would have been slobbering fools...add to that a massive injury that makes it near impossible for you to me mobile without narcotics that impair your senses and the assistance of another? A lesser woman would have cracked under the stress.  Not that I'm trying to toot my own horn, (actually I'm just trying to talk my way to a solution) but I think that I've managed to turn out alright from this one. Not so much as if I were staring from the bottom of a 8' deep ditch, but more like I have fallen in the dirt and I'm ready to dust myself off and clean up the wounds and keep going. Its still difficult to get my bearings. So much has changed in just the 5 months since all of these horrors have happened. (Christ, it has been 5 months now hasn't it.) And from my perspective life has sped up around me. I know that it's going to take some time to adjust, not much hopefully, but I've been good at faking the dance steps. (good god talk about baddly mixed metaphors.)  - so here's hoping that the procrastination will begin to fall by the wayside. I should make a list: 1. pick up the freaking guitar and start learning your chords and chord progressions 2. get a guitar teacher. 3. go to the goddamned gym at least 2x's a week...fat ass 4. eat less, you fat fuck...(I'm talking to myself now...its a sure sign of madness I know it.) 5. actually study for the goddamned GRE. 6. apply your mind in a noble persuit that does not directly benefit you. (on my way to saint hood!) 7. don't look at so much porn online.   - that's looking like a good starting point. since it was all off the cuff anyway.

      I've been looking for this for about 5 years now. I've finally found it again, and I hope to keep it near me so that I can always be reminded of it. I wanted to share this with you as it is one of the most moving things I've ever read. This is taken from a speech that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave on April 4th 1967, exactly a year before his assassination. The speech was entitled "Beyond Vietnam", but its basic premise was more to do with the changing face of history and our part in its formation.    We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us bare, naked and dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs of men does not flow, it ebbs.   We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is deaf to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residue of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words... "Too Late."

      okay, so it's been awhile. So I've been down in the dumps for a bit. But that's acceptable. No work, no love, no money and no perceptable future. That would get anyone down.   - so now that things have turned around I'm determined to make the most of what I've got. IT'S a JOB!!! yes a brand spanking new job, doing exactly what I was doing before, and for the same pay, minus benefits and minus travel. Which is not such a bad thing. This could definetly make me tired after several years of being on the run...made me feel like I was on the run from the law, or something.  Now the downside of this wonderful news means that I have to get my act together and start all over. I have to get up early and drag my lazy butt an hour away from home to get my money on. oh well. That and the good thing is that I also have to learn all about more software programs and learn how to disseminate them to others.   SO this will definietly be interesting if only because there is suddenly so much more for me to do. Classes, Work, Driving about 80 miles a day...ugh. Is it worth it? well when you don't have work, (or money for that matter) it's worth it. You make it worth it. I'm going to have to get used to working again. 6 months of sleeping in and lazying about have now ended and I have to get back on schedule. With everthing. It also means no more mid week vacations to anywhere.   Its good news, really. So why am I trying to convince myself that it is?

      oy! (With jewish accent intact) I've met a nice boy. He's shy...and as a result I'm already bored, or scared. I can't really make up my mind yet. Odd that I'm feeling this way. He's attractive and so automatically I'm wondering why he finds me attractive, because in my own minds eye I'm fucked up. Really fucked up. That and I'm brooding. I always am brooding when I have NO money and tons of time.   - if you can't tell I'm still unemployed. Still looking and still having no success at getting employment. Its one third lazyness, one third half hearted attempts to get employment and the last third shitty job market. All things being equal means that I won't have work for some time...only more expenses.  - on another note, because I am unemployed I thought that it'd be a great idea to go on a road trip to Mt. Shasta....I should have known better. I have never ventured into that particular part of Northern California without some dilemma occuring to the car that I am traveling in. (actually this is the only time that this has happened to me, but I KNOW when to throw in the towel. Nature just doesn't want me there.) so here are the abbreviated details: Unintentionally went off-roading in a 98 VW Golf; Lost a piece of steel from the undercarriage while off-roading; got very-very lost in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest; managed to get back to the paved road only to get a massive flat on the left front tire. But being a natural with car incidents, (I owned a ford escort hatchback prior to my VW) I was able to get my tire changed in 5 minutes flat. Not good enough for the Brickyard pit crew or anything...but damned good for a car filled to the brim with camping equipment and other "goodies" Not joking either. I had my friend time me. 5 Minutes....hmmm  - regardless: this guy...dunno. he's cute, but (and yes his is cute) it's only been the third time I've seen him - actually the first when there wasn't 20 or so other people around goading me to find out if I thought that he was nice. It was a set-up originally - a set up that almost didn't happen. But its a good distraction all around.   - sarcasam aside: rent's due, I'm broke, and my pimp's about to come-a-callin. gotta go.    *edit: I've just re-read my short-list, of course the only one that I've been only slightly succesful at is getting to the gym 2x's a week. gotta keep working on the rest.

      So things are plodding along.   Job (check) Opposite sex (check) Money (check) Good Health ....um check. Sort of.  The point being that I was plodding along and was not paying attention last week. I WAS plodding along minding my own, and then the klutzy-inevitable happened. I banged my toe. But this time I banged it good enough to pull the nail off...of my big toe. *sigh*   although at the time sighing was not exactly what I was engaged it.  more like a turretsian fit of expletives flowing from my mouth. I wish that I could say that it was a rare sight. Unfortunately for me...its pretty common to see me doing this exact thing. Swearing a blue streak as the result of my own inability to understand my personal spatial relations with the rest of the world.   god damn I'm klutzy.  I'm surprized that I haven't ended up in traction or a full body cast already. 'Cause it feels like I'm headed in that direction already.

      Yesterday was a strange mixture of great and sad.  Jorje Antonio Cuervas died 2 weeks ago of complications due to liver cancer. He was a wonderful man. Quiet, loving and musical he will be missed RIP 1945 - 2003   I went to the wake yesterday morning. It was at the Fort Mason in Building A. The place was filled with people who loved and wanted to honor his memory. It was truly touching, and very emotional. I cried. Not for myself, but for his wonderful family who now have to live without him.  Then I decided to go hikin...in Marin...in a skirt...and flimsy shoes. It was not (obviously) a good idear.

      Time has sped up, and in the wake of this extra momentum I've been negligent of so many people and things that I needen't have been.  Yet I think they may be wiling to forgive me. Tonight I'm going to celebrate life - Tonight I'm going to live it up with a bang, if only for a little while. You know I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm going to gossip fiendishly and flirt shamelessly. And somehow manage to get to bed at a respectable hour.  - haven't got any money riding on it though.

      Three years and a lifetime away from the moment I "thought" life would change forever.  Strangely Life has stayed somewhat the same. I'm not quite sure if that is good; having been told ad naseum that I MUST feel a sense of loss and greif for those who did suffer innocently at the hands of others.   And I do. However I am more scared that "we" collectively haven't learned from what has transpired. That scares me more than an angry group of terrorists who lash out because it they feel it is the ONLY way to make themselves heard.  And I am still as helpless as I was at 5:45 am PST 9/11/01.

      Week 1 and a half completed...and already I'm sick as dog. I caught a cold the VERY first week that I was at my office. ugh. It was a head cold and has now culminated into a chest cold...meaning that I've managed to cough away my voice. Christ. Things could not have had a more awful beginning.  Truthfully the job seems great sofar. But as a temp I'm treated as a temp and all of the other super-imposed sterotypes that go along with being a temp. I don't have access to files that I'll need in order to do the work that's been asked of me. I can't assist because I don't have access to the directories that I do need access to in order for me to assist...the list goes on and on.  it could make a girls frustrated. But why? 'Cause I'm a temp...I'm really only going to be here for a few more months...I can tough it out.

      another baseball season comes to a close and the same damn team always makes to the playoffs. I wonder if it ever seems as boring as it actually is to the rest of the world. hmm.   talking to myself again. Its an awful habit I've re-acquainted myself with. Things have been going along swimmingly...Pippo got a job and a working visa. he'll be returning at the end of October for the holidays. Its good to know that he'll be coming back after the scare that he gave us last week. Very suddenly and incredibly breifly he tried to slip out of sight without anyone knowing where in the hell he was going to. We only JUST got the chance to get in a send-off under the wire before he fled the coop. Not very nice of him.  however it is a good sign. It is also an auspicious sign that Ken got a job as well. Over a year and a half of nothing and he got an offer. Its not definite but it is definitely promising. You have to be hopeful otherwise there is no way that you can survive that kind of torment. Besides....EOP works in his favor. Most companies would kill to have an intelegent black man as an employee. (not necessarily loyal mind you - and rightfully so considering the prior hell he went through with his previous employers.)  so things are looking up. I am making a good impression...and if my memory serves me there was mention by my predicessor that she might not return after the birth of her child. I'm hopeful that she will NOT return if only because I like having a paycheck. I like having a job to go to. I like having co-workers again. And although the work is not necessarily saving anyones life...it is satisfying nonetheless.

Although much more fun because now there is evidence of your stupidity. HA.  I am happy - and this is terribly rare...its meant to explain the absence of posts...When I'm happy I tend to get wrapped up in it. and that is not necessarily such a bad thing - it just means that my life becomes mundane in the meantime.   that and this is really just a segway before I get rip-roaring drunk tonight...  yay for international cronies who love to drink as much as I.

      Okay in an effort to show that I am somewhat inclined to being hip (okay keep the sniggering down you!)  I am now happily plugging along on the web when I encounter a new voice.   ernie halter.  he's good.   AND he's white...although until I saw a picture I was CONVINCED that he had some flava to savaahh...  Now I normally don't ever expect to find good stuff on daretosing.com...heck even I know that my Bathroom voice should never be heard outside the shower. Nevertheless he has a real talent and musicanship that anyone could appreciate. I gotta give my props since I ducked out of the singing gig and am now exclusively maligned to the Birthday singing and Windows-UP car singing.  so now That I've sufficently plugged...one last one...go to urlLink  erniehalter.com  and download some songs...  that and   I got a new tooooyyyy/bright and shiiinnnnyy new toooyyy and I'm gonna play it till myyyy batteries diiiiieeeee!  *skips away frantically * - aren't YOU Jealous of my new iPod?!?!? Ain't it sexy?!?!?!

      Okay so here's the deal....I have a cold, I am working in an office for which I don't care to actually work here since I'm a temp, I want a holiday - after 3 months of employment it feels like a lifetime again...  where is my rich old man willing to hook a girl up for the rest of her life? When did I give up on that brillian plan? Instead its looking more and more like I am becoming entrenched in the middle class idle time life style that emphasizes money and ownership over all else. I guess its the easiest thing to do considering that I'm insanely lazy.  christ its been over a month since I ever even though to look at - up date this damned blog anyway. Lord knows how long it has been since I've even updated the journal.   I actually should be celebrating my 1 year anniversary of this blog... approximately one year ago I began to post my mindless self-indulgent  ramblings on this place. I haven't really gotten anywhere fast. Babies have been born, I've broken and healed myself; been laid off then hired again....Hmmm I guess pretty interesting in fact.   Europe was fun, having a man now is even more fun...(I get to play evil tricks on him - and its even more fun when he goes along with it...ahahahah) I miss those who are gone (died/left/moved on) but I'm enjoying those whom have stayed behind. Marriages are coming around the bend...and no real ideal of why in the heck they are all rushing off to pay more in taxes to the government.  odd.

      it has been a new year for me.   I am older - and in no way has it made me wiser. I am more cautious; a little heavier around the middle (I blame hapiness and generally richer foods)  wow. I never thought that I would be able to say that at my age I wish for MORE stability - but in its own way stability makes me feel more comforted simply because it allows apathy - it encourages it even.   I miss apathy.   Who am I kidding. I like a regular paycheck.

      on the hunt again for work has made me realize how much random shit I have laying around the house that I have never gotten to.  you know what I mean...that pile of papers you'd like to call junk, but the power company, the phone company and the cable company like to call bills and last notices? not to mention the requisite thank you letters that you're supposed to be sending to all those people who actually remembered you this year and gave you presents - not not just the ones who are supposed to send you things but the unexpected ones who did as well this year.   nevermind cleaning up. GOD damned this infernal desire to make sure that things don't start growing on my clothes - or inside of my pantry. Shit.   It's also amazing to see how much money you can loose by just living. It's incredible to see how much the cost of just plain living has gotten so much more expensive.

Unemployment line here I come ...  on the bright side - I only had to wake up at 7:30 am to move my car for street cleaning. Cool. aaand I got several errands finished.

      Happy uneventful New Year!!!!  although soggy...It was an uneventful new year. Not much happened, except the brilliant idea to take a bottle of champagne and go to the top of a mall - to see the holiday fireworks.   and incidentally - whoever says that he weather people don't have it down is full of it. They "predicted" that it would start to rain at midnight, and on the dot - 12 am precisely it began to come down. It wasn't torrential or anything like that, but I'd like to think that it was earth's way of cleansing itself for the new year....Starting fresh maybe. Or some bullshit like that.   oh well...Me waxing philosophical at the turn of the new year already. Have fun nursing your hangovers today kiddies!

      yoga is sweaty, grunty, and generally painful streching.  - but I think I'm going to like it. Although I nearly slipped several times on my mat from sweating so damned much that I was dripping all over the place. But the best part was at the end when I got to literally sleep on the floor for another few minutes.   It finally came to a head - I HAD to go back to the gym...When I couldn't fit comfortably into my jeans and the flabby flop of flesh (say that fast ten times) had turned into folds of other unmentionable dimensions it was sad. Basically I'd put on about 20lbs since I had started work approximately 6 months ago at Morrison & Foerster in Palo Alto. drivng to and fro from san francisco and then stuffing my face with random junk foods because I didn't have enough time to cook or even spill a bowl of cereal down my shirt...well it added up. (especially around my waist)  regardless - it needed to be done. My knees were starting to seriously hurt from the pain of that extra 20lbs.

      So, I've managed to try and keep this up for more than a year. Not very successful, but if I Felt so inclined I could let you see the inside of my very personal journal. And then you'd get to understand that there really isn't much of a digression there.   Pretty much a slacker - always a slacker. Why couldnt I just marry rich and then pay someone to remind me to do this crap. (HA!)  The details: I've got an Aussie visiting. It's infectious, this desire to travel. It's the type of thing that is worse than meningitis. It itches up your spine, curiously - quietly...next thing you know you're gone. To the Head - you're flying and the adrenaline is more than anything that you've ever paid for before. (no I'm not on drugs mom - just the best metha-phor I could come with - ha.)  But it's made me really wish that I had that kind of freedom. It doesn't help the situation with the fact that my Brother is leaving to go and build a home in New Mexico. No, not buy, Build. It's not unusual - he's done it before, but the prospect that he gets to do it, simply because he wants to is what is killing me. I want to be there too - sun on my back - sweat in my face, my hands muddy and calloused from 'real' work...and being able to see  the substantive progress that I've made at the end of a day.   - (here we go again - I'm about to start prosletizing so skip to the end if you care not to read)  We've missed out on something. I've been coddled by 'Better Living Through Science!' True that there is less of a chance that I might die from a hangnail...but at the same time this doesn't feel right either. Sitting on my ass for several hours a day bitching and griping about whatever crosses my path doesn't feel right either.    I can only remember a few snatches of time when I was blissful...and all of it when I was doing mindless - manual labor. (not so mindless actually - have the fun was seeing the puzzle completed - another metaphor - they are getting really mixed up now) Basically my lament is the exact same as every other displeased - fattened up - miserable middle class girl...I miss the romance of an older time. When we had to work for our "daily bread" but truthfully there is very little likely hood that I'd ever go for that.   actually... hell no would I be willing to supplicate myself to some other system so that I could have a 'romantic' ideal when I had daily chores that inculded crap like that.  oh well. so much for that silver lining. (crap - okay last metaphor)

      I don't know if I'm getting hooked or not, but I think regardless I'm falling in love with a laptop...And its not my own...  - silly isn't it that there is the likelihood that I could be such a geek as to fall for a laptop. Actually it isn't mine its for a company that I'm contracting for. But they are so silly - they didn't have me sign any release for it - nor did they even ask that I hand over my firstborn for it. Kinda odd - just showed up when I was told and then they gave it to me. Kinda nice - would be great if that was what it was like all over.   Other great news - a long lost friend from Australia has come to visit. I'm showing her around the bay area so that she can get an idea of what it's really like to live here - actually I'm lying - I'm taking her to all the requisite showy spots so that she falls in love with the place and won't want to leave. That's my hope.  Actually while I've been doing all this - She suggested that maybe I should open up a tours organization for 20-somethings on a budget. I think that mum would love it. It'd be great - rent the room for a few weeks - then get the girl or guy a great tour - then send them off on a bus. Personally it sounds exactly like what I should be doing anyway considering whenever I have a friend who is visiting it's what I end doing anyway - why not get paid for it. HA! (it'd be seasonal work anyway - so no guarantee that I'd even have consistent work.) But its a thought all the same. Keep me in shape that's for damn sure. Would be nice   - go along - take pictures, give local history, be a a general guru - then send them off to the next location - some place like NM - and 'em off to my brother...That might be kinda nice. hmmm....Now if only that hampster would stop churning around in my head.

      what in the hell did I do this to myself for? For a life time I thought that I would be done with help desk - yet I've managed to torture myself again with the pointless - life sucking; soul depleting issues of no one in particular. This is effing ridiculous.   - okay so I'm on the rag, but still 10 calls in one day from the same person about the same fucking thing. e-mail. fucking e-mail. who the fuck needs e-mail anyway. On top of all that bullshit I just found out not too long ago that they fucking put god-damned big brother effing software on my god damned work computer.  So fuck you fucking big fucking brother. Fuck you and your fucking higer ground morality in trying to suffocate me into working to god-damned long of a fucking work day - force me into a fucking hole of a work space and then trow fucking screaming cats at me all day long with their god-damned talons out stretched looking for any fucking excuse to claw me to fucking bits.   fuck you.   but keep the checks coming. :D

I didn't even hear an alarm.  &nbsp; I can't even be angry at them/him/someone. Because there is nothing to be mad at.

      As I've come to realize during the day to day monotony of white color labor...  I am trapped. I am cornered. I am being constantly watched and under the "protective" glaring eye of...everyone.   Part of it, no heck Most of it, is of my own doing. It's my own damn fault that I appreciate technology and what it can offer me in the way of virtual gratification. (take note of the virtual...I've never gotten a Reeces Peanut Butter Cup to instantaneously appear whenever I've registered to their stupid website.) That and I really like to espouse my own opinion to the widest possible group. (i.e. blogging)  So okay - here's the impetus for this blog...If you consider what you actually do in a days work, how much of your personality is actually transmitted through the computer through website visits, e-mails created, documents stored, and general feckery (as some of my favorite brits call slacking) its pretty scary to realize that all of that information is trackable. It IS storable, sortable, and cross-reference-able it is possible that you can create a plausable history of someone and who they are based generally on just that information.   That, and there is so much other stuff that you may not even know is out there - nefarious little spyware programs whittling away at your computer. Infesting the delicate little diorama you may have created to make your computer feel less the mechanical tool that it is and more like an extension of yourself. Nevermind what your company may be doing to you - like tracking your every move - shadowing what you are doing watching carefully what you have done so that when it comes down to it -   you are not you.   You belong to everyone and cannot belong to yourself because you have given up all of yourself unintentionally.    so...does that make me crazy to believe that I am not me - because I do not know who knows about me and I cannot control who sees what about me? Or possibly that this isn't even me?  uh yeah. I need to get out more...that and I think I need a glass of wine.

      I never thought myself one whom would comment on the political state of being...(HA!) Regardless:  CORRECTED: U.S. Terror Warnings Lack Specifics - Report By REUTERS Published: July 13, 2004 Filed at 11:55 a.m. ET  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government terror warnings to local police and citizens fail to give the specific information many authorities say is needed to protect the public, a congressional report said on Monday.  The report follows a series of official warnings about possible attacks -- most recently voiced last week by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge -- which lacked new intelligence or details on the threat and how to respond.The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, was based on survey of 28 agencies and 56 states and territories. Those responding ``generally indicated that they did not receive specific threat information and guidance, which they believe hindered their ability to determine and implement protective measures,'' the report said.  Some critics have accused President Bush's administration of using terrorism warnings as a political tool. Bush has made the fight against global terrorism a major theme of his campaign for reelection.   Only to later yesterday find out that there were terrorist threats Possibly to occur at or around November election dates. Uh yeah. Bush fo sho ain't usin nuttin like terror-ism to git me away from the votin box.   whooo-eee!!!

       urlLink New York Post Online Edition: gossip  Regarding TV Comic Andy Dick is that he went on a randy rampage at Suede early yesterday that ended after he burst into tears over the death of his friend Rick James and was thrown out of the Chelsea club by "Little Shop of Horrors" star Joey Fatone.   Dick, the star of MTV's "The Assistant," was desperately in need of a minion to get him under control as he tried to kiss any man or woman he bumped into, including "Austin Powers" actor Seth Green, rolled around on the men's room floor, and asked clubgoers if they had cocaine.   The vodka and cranberry-swilling comic then barricaded himself in Suede's dishwashing room and began sobbing uncontrollably about James, who died last week, reports an eyewitness who witnessed the meltdown. "My best friend is dead!" Dick wailed. "He's gone! He's dead! You don't understand! All my best friends die!"   Dick then handed a dishwasher a stack of $100 bills so he could "live in the room." When Fatone — whom Dick taunted as "Fat One" — and Suede owner Eytan Sugarman tried to coax him to leave, Dick said, "You don't want to push me around, because I'm perfectly capable of doing this" — and punched an unidentified friend standing next to him in the face.   Finally, Fatone, the former *NSYNC member who co-hosts a Tuesday night party at Suede with promoter Brandon Marcel, dragged the blubbering Dick outside with the help of Sugarman and loaded him into a cab in front of a crowd that included Green, Mets outfielder Cliff Floyd and MTV veejay Vanessa Minnillo. Green was overheard sputtering, "That guy tried to kiss me," as Dick was hauled past him.   But Dick's rowdy romp wasn't over yet. The former "News Radio" star, who has battled drug and alcohol abuse in the past, headed downtown to Plan B on Avenue B and promptly commenced smooching and slapping the people inside.   "He was obviously obliterated," Plan B co-owner Josh Boyd told us. "He jumped on the back of Jason Battle, my co-owner, and kept trying to kiss him. Then he started getting violent and bitch-slapping people.   "We finally quarantined him and put him in a separate room. But then he slipped outside and skipped out on his $300 bar tab. The last anyone saw of him, he was rolling around the street on Avenue B."   Dick's manager declined comment.

      For me... I am always more and more surprized about the growing littany of information that is building against the 2nd Bush administration and their intentional actions to tear us down. (to our smallest parts)  I came across this after looking at Air America Radio page, and it is the type of thing that drives me mad. We know about a man, well before his election to the position, and yet the bureacracy that is supposed to help us has kept our hands tied, rather than to ensure that we are being "watched out for"  I am spitting mad about or urlLink Our new CIA cheif.  But I'm left feeling like "What can I do?"

      bored, bored, bored!  I am trying to amuse myself with letters to editors of strange and far-fetched publications. (there is a greater possibility that I will get responded/printed to)  so am I bored. No more IM'ing allowed at work, and now I find that I have nothing to do. It makes for a very, very looooonnnng day.  maybe instead of sitting on my ass and complaining. I should try to work. Novel idea, though it is, it still feels pointless...futile, and generally useless.

      For all those times when I thought I could just dive into the Fountains for money...not once did I ever think this would happen.   urlLink Teen Bitten By Piranha In Fountain  Taken from the AP wire: Thursday, August 5, 2004  "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong teenager reached into a fountain hoping to scoop up a fish but ended up being bitten by what turned out to be a man-eating piranha, officials said Tuesday.   The 14-year-old boy required three stitches to his left index finger but was not seriously injured in the attack early Monday morning, Housing Authority spokeswoman May Tham said.   A cleaning crew drained the fountain the next morning and found it had contained two piranhas -- apparently pets that had been abandoned in the fountain at a public housing project.   Ming Pao Daily News ran a photo of the dead piranhas and one of the boy, with his left hand in a sling and blood on his short pants."

       urlLink California's SUV Ban - The Golden State has outlawed big SUVs on many of its roads but doesn't seem to know it.  (article from Slate.com)  "Here's what few people seem to realize: By weighing in at more than 6,000 pounds, big SUVs are prohibited on thousands of miles of road in California. Cities across the state including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Santa Monica use the 3-ton cutoff for many or nearly all of their residential streets. State law gives them the ability to do this for very straightforward reasons: The heavier the vehicle, the more it chews up the roads, endangers pedestrians and smaller vehicles, and makes noise. "  hence the reason why I'm doing a little happy dance right now. (sort of)  This would go hand in hand with my ultimate joy of joys...A REAL graduated tax that would immediately take 45 – 50% off the top for any individual who makes over 100,000 a year.   ahhhh... a girl can dream, can't she?
