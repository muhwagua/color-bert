      As senior year approaches, I've been thinking a lot about how I stack up against my peers in terms of maturity.  Its hard to say where I stand because in certain areas it seems like I'm ahead of the game but, as I'm my own worst critic, I know that deep down I'm a kid.  Not all that kid at heart kind of crap.  I'm a kid.  As you know from my profile and previous posts, I very much enjoy playground games like dodgeball and kickball.  That's okay. you may say, those are actually becoming hip again.  No, I think I like them at a different level than the twentysomethings who have founded those leagues.  To illustrate my point, I will tell you, the faceless and nameless, that I still am tempted to buy G.I. Joes.  Very tempted.  When I was at Target reserving my limited edition of Halo 2 as I said yesterday, I wandered done the toy aisle.  Not to reminisce.  To see what they had in the way of my favorite action figures.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Besides vehicles, they had figures in two packs for seven bucks and three packs for nine.  There was a Cobra three pack and I probably would have bought it if I didn't already have the Cobra Commander.  I pulled myself away with my last vestige of dignity (I was admiring them alongside a six-year-old) and left to find my mom and youngest brother.  But today, at Fred Meyer's it came at me again.  I even avoided the toy department in fear of another test of willpower, but Satan had other plans.  Browsing the school supplies, waiting for my the same brother, I spied a discount table.  Bored, I went over to it.  There was my second temptation.  A Cobra plane.  That converted to a hydrofoil.  On sale.  As I have neither a plane or boat for the bad guys, this almost proved to great for me to overcome.  But after almost three minutes of indecision, I somehow stopped myself and left.  But I fear the third temptation, my friends.  Even as I write this I am choking down regret that I did not purchase these infantile delights.  I am growing weak.  I fear I cannot leave the house lest I revert back to my seven year old self.  And the rationalizer in my wants to ask you, am I so wrong?  Is what I desire so bad? Tell me your opinion of my plight, dear reader.  I feel so alone.

      I realized today that I am an addict to Minesweeper. How did I realize this, when it's so hard for addicts to admit their problems? Even addicts have to admit that one is addicted when one sees the little Minesweeper numbers even when one has his/her eyes closed and is not looking at a computer screen.  Yes, it is painful for me to say, especially here among such esteemed colleagues, but perhaps ridicule is the medicine I need to help me stay on the road to recovery.  And while I think about it, there are worse addictions...like to narcotics, opiates, hallucinogens, inhalents, Altoids, bad music, Fabio, toasters, etc.  That's my news for the moment.

      ...and there was something strangely refreshing about it.  I think that just like the green leafy things that grow around my house, we all need a little water to fall on us and soak us sometimes.  Not that we'd die without it, but then, those plants won't die either.  But just that it helps us to reach a higher plane of health, some plateu from which we can stand and scream into the gray falling skys "I am alive!  I am alive!  I may be soaking wet, but I am alive!" before we realize the entire church is now staring at us. A weird thing about rain is how much it changes things.  I mean, its just a little bit of water, right?  We drink tons of water every day.  But once a tad bit of it starts falling on us, people totally freak out.  They drive really slowly, they run around screaming as they fail to locate their cars, they fight over strange little sticks with canvas, and some of them even curse loudly as their attached furry headcovering are drenched through.  (Something about messing up their style.  I fail to grasp it.)  People who would normally be quite glad to lay on a hillside with me and chat the day away are now flabbergasted at the suggestion.  What's their problem, anyways?  We're 80% water to begin with...how's a little more gonna hurt?  The most depressing thing about rain, though (well, the only depressing thing about rain) is that it covers up the stars.  My nightly glimpses into the black and starlit heavens has been a favorite time of mine to contemplate how truely insignificant that little peon is who decided to cut me off today and ended up almost causing a major accident.  After all, what does it really matter if i jumped out of my speeding hunk of metal, holding another peice of metal alloy, and began hitting both a large bit of metal and some carbon based object that was significantly softer than the large hunk of metal?  It really doesn't, does it?  Its times like these when I can convince myself that perhaps those other bits of carbon carrying much smaller peices of metal will agree with me and decided not to use their peices of metal to embed even smaller peices of metal into my carbon.  I find this view extremely relaxing.  But without the stars, its utterly impossible to obtain.  I did decide on the rules to my new sport, though.  Its called "Shirt Basketball".  Dunks (anything involving contact between either of your hands/digits and any part of the target) are worth one point.  This includes shots where you pull the shirt away from the target's body in order to make the shot possible.  Free Throws, shots where the target intentionally invites a shot after stopping and pulling their own shirt forward to enable the shot to be made, are also worth one point, unless they are made from four point distance, in which case it is worth three.  Here's where things get tricky.  Because of the wide variety of shirts worn by various targets, and differing amounts of room between said shirt and the target (caused by non-standard shirt types, larger-than-average amounts of cleavage, skintight verse baggy shirts, etc.) the points differ based on both difficulty and distance.  Standard scoring works as such: within five feet of the target is worth two points.  Outside of five feet is worth four.  Mulitpliers are added based on the difficulty of the shot.  Contestants determine the value of each target (and their attached shirt) before competition begins.  Both must agree on the value before taking a shot.  In the event a shot is made before a value is agreed upon, an arbitrary third party is asked to set a fair value.  When lacking a third party, the opponent is allowed to pick a fair value.  The maximum multiplier for normal circumstances is ten times the normal point value, with the rare exception of a shot being made on a target wearing only a bra (or appropriate equivelent) which garners a twentyfive times bonus, and a shot made on a completely bare target, which garners a hunderd times bonus along with a wack across the back of the head for being dumb enough to waste such a valuable opportunity.  Additional multipliers are added based on circumstances, such as backwards, no look (eyes shut), hook shots, off hand shots, using an unusual object (such as a computer monitor), using a difficult object (something that doesn't easily fit, also like a computer monitor or even something simpler like a basketball), using an awkward object (ice that the target cannot easily retreive), cauing the target to remove clothing to fetch the object, and evoking a positive reaction from the target (such as an invitation to retireve the object yourself).  Points are lost for injuring the object, evoking a negative reaction (such as a bitch slap or forced removal from a house or resteraunt), or shooting on a target in a dangerous situation (such as the driver of a vehicle).  It is also not reccomended to shoot on targets with which one is not familiar, or which one is not signifantly faster than.  I predict Shirt Basketball will make it to the Olympics by 2020.  Only you, my valiant readers can help make this dream a reality.  Go forth and throw things down shirts, men!  Do it for justice, for honor, and for the American Dream: to earn money without doing any real work!

      Just reserved Halo 2.  Supposed to be out November 9th.  Hopefully by then I'll be all done with college applications because I'm pretty sure I'm doing early action (or decision I don't know which is the non-binding one) at every place I apply.  Then I will have time to play the most anticipated game of alltime.  In other news, all the horsemen and assorted other cool kids from Jesuit went to Pioneer Courthouse Square to see The Goonies yesterday.  Turnout was great, the crowd ran the gamut from the hiphop crowd to goths.  All united by loving the phrase "hey you guys."  Proving The Goonies is one of the greatest movies of alltime.

            The four horsemen are assembled and the charge will begin.  The charge to retake the internet from the disgusting hands of the pornographers and return to where it rightfully belongs, the hands of teenage boys.  Beginning today, the horsemen will begin the most difficult, the most dangerous task ever placed upon any humans in history of mankind.  We will build up our readership, convincing people worldwide that our blog is more interesting than porn.  They will fight us, sending hitwomen with huge breasts after us (they will be easy to spot, beautiful women don't associate with the horsemen), but we will persevere.  One day, one glorious day, our site will have more visitors than all the porn in all the world.  Impossible, you say.  We don't listen to such words here.  We horsemen believe in the the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.  It eluded us then, but that's no matter--  Tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....  And one fine morning---        So we beat on, boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past.

      So this morning, I kinda forgot that I had no football today.  Which isn't very surpising, since I have it like every day except sunday for the next 80 months.  Or something.  But so I not only forgot that I had no football, but also forgot what time the football I didn't have was at.  This was an unbearable state of affairs, I assure you.  I attempted a mad dash up the stairs only to be brought startlingly short by the fact that my legs didn't want to listen to me.  They decided to listen to someone else, someone completely unrelated to me and also quite invisible, who told them their time would be much better spent by spasming out.  After all, what legs wouldn't want to just sorta quiver on the floor instead of actually sprinting?   This bodily mutany forced me to rely upon my trusty (and much more loyal) arms for my transportation out of my basement lair.  All went well until I came to the door.  Ever tried opening a door at the top of some stairs without being able to use your legs?  It was quite tricky...in the end, I propped myself against it, leaned hard, then managed to stroke the handle enough for it to somehow pop open.  Victory at last!   But with only one small problem...my football schedule is on the fridge.  High up on the fridge.  At what is normally eye level for my towering 6'2" frame.  Having your eyes reduced to midgethood (at only 6" off the ground, I was small even for one of the little people) makes it rather difficult to read things on the fridge 6 feet above your head.  Well, reading things 6 feet above your head on the fridge when they were made in point 12 font is always hard, its just most people don't have 12 foot fridges with football schedules on them, so I don't run into this problem every day.  Again, my brilliant mind came to the rescue.  STOOLS!  No, not the kind you leave in the toilette or some turncoat mafia member (both of which have about the same smell, slimy skin, and high value on the street) but the wooden kind you normally would perch upon to dine at my luxerious countertop in the kitchen.  With two of them placed the appropriate distance apart, I was easily able to lift myself up onto a sitting position upon a third.  It was kinda like doing a really monsterous dip, only with dogs staring in shock and my legs still doing their own little dance.  From this high and mighty vantage point I was shocked to assertain that practice had started a good hour ago.  But wait, my mind screamed, today could not be the 23rd!  It simply couldn't!  I hadn't watched Casablanca yet, and I absolutely knew it was due by the 23rd!  Faced with this cold, unforgiving logic, my brain was forced to admit, that no, today probably wasn't the 23rd.  Furthermore, the phoney thing clearly said it was the 20th.  But that couldn't be either, could it?  There was no football practice on the 20th...and if there was no practice, there was no reason for my legs to be so badly misbehaving, nor for me to have to crawl upstairs to check when practice started.     At this point, my legs decided the invisible stranger had led them astray from the True Path which is a body part's only real hope to enter the Divine Heaven that is Sitting On A Lazy Boy With A Giant Glass Of Iced Lemonade Watching Bond Movie And Eating Ribs.  Of course, my legs have never (and if I have any say in it, WILL never) eaten a rib, drunk lemonade, or even seen James Bond.  However, they understand that this is a blissful state, and they certainly enjoy sitting in a Lazy Boy more than running.  This leads them to beleive that this Divine Heaven must be a nice place to be, and hey, everyone else seems excited about it, so why shouldn't they? This allowed me to return my arms to their normal role of hanging at my sides and occasionally turning doornobs and reaching for remotes and lightswitches.  I decided the ordeal meant my entire body deserved a dip in the Semi-Divine Heaven that is a Warm Bath With Lots Of Bubbles And Soothing Music And Smelling Salts.  Though I was pretty sure I was out of smelling salts, I figured I could fake my nose out with with some fragrant bubble stuff.  Or maybe a nice candle.  I again had to face a flight of stairs to obtain my goal, but for this one I could asend as humans do, and not the humans who have paralyzing back injuries and no elevators or kind people to carry them.  However, as I walked past my front door, I looked out the window.  Through that window, I could see inside my car.  And through that window letting me see inside my car, I could see throught the window going out of my car.  And throught that window going out of my car I could see into my neighbor's window across the street.  And through THAT window across the street I beheld a strange sight indeed.   For my 19 year old blonde streetmate was dancing some sort of weird macarana-like dance.  And here I thought she'd already left for college, or at least moved in with some 24 year old hippie.  Wow.  People really should shut their blinds once in a while.  I'm not one to talk, though.  There are no blinds on the glass door in my basement.  And I love dancing around in my skivies down there.  But no one's dumb enough to risk peering through MY windows.  Are they?

      which took more guts than it really should've.  See, usually I think of myself as someone who's not afraid of anything--who'll try anything once as long as there's a reasonable chance of survival.  (It's not that I'm AFRAID of dying, it's more that I don't want to inconvenience God by making Him resurrect me so I can be Ultimate King of All That Surrounds Me.)  Anyway, I call, heart beating audibly.  Ring... ring... then, "...WHAT?"  In this age of caller ID, what can I conclude but that I really, really pissed her off, just by calling?  But I pretend that all is not lost.  "Uh, hey there!  How's it going?"  And it isn't!  "OH! Ken! Sorry, I thought you were my mom!"  Hmmmmm.  One more reason to earn that manly Eagle Scout award.  If this supernatural maternal reminder didn't happen so often, it wouldn't bother me that much, but...  I mean, I wasn't even planning on being a stay-at-home DAD, let alone Mom.  But it's okay.  Now I'm waiting for her to call back, thinking, "Hey, it could have gone worse," then asking myself, "Why do you even care?"  Honestly, I don't know.  Just don't know.  School hasn't started yet and I haven't seen her for over two months.  Shouldn't that have been cathartic?  So far it's been as cathartic as being anally probed by extraterrestrials that only measure the charge capacity of your nether regions--with a cattle prod.  BZZZZZZT!  Every day.  That prod doesn't even fit (please don't think about that).  And I'm left where I used to be--thinking, "boy, I wish I was over this," and then thinking, "wait, no, what I really want is for everything to work out," and then, "man, I could really use some kind of legal nerve stimulant so I can stop being tired all the time."  Hey, as long as it's not a cattle prod.  It might damage the cell phone--and then how would she call back?

      The anticipation for Ken's first post is killing me.  If you've read his "about me" you know its going to fucking rock.  I'm sure he's putting the finishing touches on it as I type.  Meanwhile, John participating in conditioning week for football, so we're going to give his absence the benefit of the doubt.  So it looks like Miguel is the only horseman who pulled through for me.  He did a great job; I can't wait for another post.

      This is a shout out to our only reader, Shakeer.  Without him the blog would be 89% worse.  If you are offended because you also read this blog and you want a shout out, leave a damn comment once and a while.  I know its only been six days, but I was counting on the million monkeys on a million computers thing.  And its been a big disappointment.

      For the last two weeks I have really been looking forward to this weekend because there is a dodgeball tournament at a high school near my house.  Dodgeball is my favorite sport and I was brimming with anticipation over assembling and leading a team of friends into such a glorious competition.  As I was ironing out the details I clicked on the waiver because I had to read it.  No one over 18.  I am 18 in less than a month.  Their unequitable line in the sand crushed my soul, telling me I am not worthy to play in their league. I'll tell you what.  They will rue the day they excluded me.  I will train harder than anyone has ever trained for anything.  I will make Rocky's training in Siberia in Rocky IV seem like a walk in the park.  And next year, when they come back to Portland from their pansy headquarters in Los Angeles, I will tear the Beaver Ball trophy from their well moistuized hands and my triumph will be sung throughout the ages by all people of all walks of life who need the inspiration of heroes to continue their own heroic existence.

      I would normally put this in the comments section, but my esteemed colleague forgot to utilize that tool.  From my brief study of Sigmund Freud, I have formulated a belief that the real object of the punk anger is their small genitalia.  Besides the obvious implications that go with that territoty there is also a reduced testosterone level which prevents said punks from being successful at manly endeavors such as sports.  This coupled with their subpar intelligence leaves them little option but "reject" the society that in fact rejected them first.

      Me being me, take my posts with a grain of salt. I do not mean to offend. Most people.  It pisses me off how many people are posers and cannot accept it. I'm a poser. I live with this knowledge. I consider it one of the many marks that I, too, am human and possess original sin. But I suffer through the insufficiency. But man, some people...  For instance, it has come to my attention that to be a punk you must fulfill a minimum three requirements:  1) Be angry. It doesn't matter what you're angry at. But you must have a perpetual simmering rage in the bowels of your soul, stewing and propelling you to speak out. Express your anger with everyone, from the people who you deem responsible to the random passerby who will raise an eyebrow and probably regard you with disdain. Note that this in turn will make you angry at the random passerby as well, because they're only kindling the source of your anger. The source of your anger does not matter. It can change at any time for any reason if necessary to keep it going...or just because you feel like it.  2) Be ugly. It is vital to the punk mindset to go against everything that is natural to the human body. Dying one's hair many colors one cannot find in any of the nooks and crannies of nature is heartily recommended. Do this frequently. Also, dessacrate the human body as much as possible with tatooes spreading across from the tips of your fingers to the small of your back to the metatarsal area. Oh, not to mention body piercings. How better to express the anger you have against your father, your life, the Man, the cat next door, and your personal hygiene appliances than by showing that you don't care what they think? And body piercings are a great way to do that. Pierce several parts of your body, be creative, and remember: if you don't go through the metal detectors at least five times, you are not carrying enough representation of your flesh mutilation.  3) This one kind of leads into the other two. Be rebellious. As with anger, it does not matter. Do not accept anything except your own beliefs to be true. Your beliefs consist of everyone else being judgmental. And that life is unfair. You should never conform. Ever. In fact, if you are reading this now, you are submitting to corporate America by paying your electric bill or even just using a computer. Dell is laughing at you, and dead punk artists are rolling in their graves.  Very few self-proclaimed "punks" have ever really fulfilled these requirements. ...     The actual point of this post was that I hate Good Charlotte, who whines about everything in life even though they have millions of dollars, are now LIVING the lifestyles of the rich and the famous, whine about not wanting a 9-5 and how the lead singer's dad is an asshole in approximately 40 of their 41 songs....yeah.  Sorry to bash on Good Charlotte fans...but if that last paragraph offended you, bite me.  Actually, the only people I hold in any remote form of disdain are the actual hardcore punks. Granted I shouldn't judge folks before I know them...but always being wrong is kind of a deterrent from talking to people.  So in reality, I like posers more.

      As you can see, Ken has joined and Mike and John will soon follow.  And a golden age will begin.  We will turn a corner.  We will believe in science.  We'll work just as hard for your jobs as we work for our own.  Terrorism will lose and we will win because the future doesn't belong to fear, it belongs to hope.

      This blog has had technical difficulties for the past few days, but they are now sorted out so we shall soon have two of the three new bloggers posting.  Which brings me to reveal something to you.  Why, you may ask, did this moron post by himself on this blog until he had it all figured out?  It seems like the gimmick is that there are four equally important bloggers and by doing this he just created an antipathy towards him by posting subpar material.  Well you would be correct.  I am a dumbass.  I wanted to have a few posts grounded in to assert my feeble personality before my friends amaze you with theirs.  I envisioned my posts as something endearing, like watching a newborn foal struggling to walk.  But it was probably just pathetic, like a foal born with three legs struggling to walk, while you know it never will.

      A short public service announcent.  Coming back from a short campout and reviewing this blog and another that I frequent, I realized that the title of my last post is the same as the other blog's only I added an exclamation point.  I am certain that I subconsciously stole it.  I feel like scum.

      I recently got a brand new kickball.  I bought one from Target about two weeks ago.  I really liked it.  My brother and I took it in the street in front of my house.  He pitched it to me.  I kicked it farther than I have ever kicked a kickball in my life.  Once we retrieved it I decided to be safe, take it inside, and wait until my next kickball game to experience the ecstasy of kicking this ball.  But wait.  My brother was inside our yard.  I decided to see how far it would drop kick.  Enormous mistake.  I am not a good drop kicker under the best of circumstances and here I was trying to kick super hard.  The kick sucked and it rolled right into my neighbor's only rose bush.  A terrible thing.  Now, I know there are a lot of awful things in our world, things a billion times worse than losing a stupid kickball.  But, since I do not possess an incredible emotional maturity, I mourned its passing.  This mopiness lasted a week.  The day we were set to go camping (which I did not want to do), I was surprised by a new ball.  A better ball.  One that came in a box like a basketball.  And cost twice as much.  It is a wonderful ball.  I love it.  Don't judge me.

               Not about the music.  About the politics.  Shame on me but I have to write this while its still fresh in my mind.  I went to the Kerry rally at Waterfront Park.  I downloaded the tickets last night and went with my dad this morning.  The gates opened at 10:00 and he was supposed to arrive about 12:15 so I figured I would get there at about 10:30, wait at the gate, and do a crossword for two hours.  I knew a lot of people would be there, but I was not prepared for this.  We got there on schedule but there were lines everywhere.  We were at the back of a line the stretched for at least a quarter mile.  I thought it must be for people who didn't have real tickets.  (If you haven't figured out by now, I'm a dumbass.)  So we crossed the street and found a much shorter line but which turned out to be for vets.  When we got back to the original line, the end was on the opposite side of the builiding we were at originally.            While waiting there were dozens of solicitors for various causes.  And protesters.  But not very many.  A couple of guys had the usual Jesus Saves From Hell stuff and were telling us to repent from our wicked ways.  One was a real loudmouth and said some of the most stupid but funniest things I have ever heard.  One particularly trifecta of irony was the fact that his sign said Bush defends America and had pictures of various military icons, then he said Bush was intelligent enough to stay out of Vietnam, just like him (the speaker), and then he went on to talk about how they were both manly men and thats why liberal women didn't like them.  After this an astute citizen asked him if he knew Bush was a cheerleader in college.  Silence.  Then he said "Really?"  Everyone said yes and then the moron mumbled that he wasn't really into politics.  He was a goldmine.          It took about an hour and a half to go the quarter mile and by the time we were at the verge of the security checkpoint the police decided that the remaining thousands would be so far away they couldn't do anything even if they wanted to.  They didn't even check the tickets.  We ended up, after a fire marshal fence was torn down, about three football fields away from the stage and Jon Bon Jovi.  He was okay, had a lot of emotion and some intelligent things to say.  Then the usual lame people that nobody cares about started talking and it got really boring until six buses came off the bridge behind us and drove to the side of the rally.  Everyone got really excited but nothing happened.  More talking.  Then three (more?) buses drove by and the buzz was back.  Finally, squinting I could see him emerge on stage.  He shook hands, reminding the unlucky majority of the over 30,000 how far away we were.  Then his wife spoke.  For a long time.  She was nice but spoke slowly, almost casually and kind of repeat repeated herself.  Then Jim Rassman came on and was pretty good.  But the crowd was yearning for Kerry.  And he delivered.  And it wasn't just his acceptance speech from the convention.  He had particulars.  Plans that made a lot of sense.  It was great.  Unfortunately I had to leave early to get to work.  I only missed about 3 minutes.  I'm glad I went.  I'm sorry that was so long.  Believe it or not, but it was edited for length.  I left a lot of good stuff out.

      The free iTunes song this week is good.  Good enough to make you download iTunes if you don't already have it.  An Irish guy under the pseudonym Simple Kid.  I heard him on some late night show a long time ago but I can't remember which.  Anyway, I like it.  He might be huge later and you will want to have said you heard him when he was a small fry.  His first CD is coming out soon.  So tell me either way.  If there's anybody out there.

      Spock would be a Democrat.  I am not a Trekkie but I have seen a few episodes and movies and the phrase "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few." stuck out in my liberal mind.  Republicans believe in individual responsibility, and I am all for that, but a society like ours will always have people who for a myriad of reasons cannot support themselves without considerable help.  And if that requires taxing the billionaire citizens of our country (there are more than you think) a few percentage points more, than Spock and I would say it is the right thing for us and the exorbitantly wealthy to do.    No more political articles for a week.  I apologize.

      This is not your father's blog.  (I have yet to impregnate anyone, so don't come to me trying to get child support for your sorry ass.)  This blog will usher in a new day.  A day of sincere, honest, and powerful writing.  Writing of real people, for real people, and by real people.  Or it will suck and wallow in the mediocrity of almost every other blog out there.  But you can only find out if you read it.

And doesn't his daughter go there?   Then again, maybe Mr. Bush was just recruited by the university for his superb cheerleading skills:     But yeah, I agree with him. I hope he pursues that stance and wasn't just saying it to impress the minority reporters that he was addressing.

      The July employment numbers wre released today. Select your poison:   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,128209,00.html   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/business/06CND-ECON.html   urlLink http://www.iht.com/articles/532875.html   Looks like payroll growth was alarmingly weak this month.   Now I'm not saying that this is all Bush's fault but it looks like Bush's plan to create jobs by handing out tax cuts isn't faring so well. He still seems convinced so though:  "Because of my policy of strengthening the economy while enforcing spending discipline in Washington, we remain on pace to reduce the deficit by half in the next five years." ( urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,127678,00.html )  Hmm, I don't see how permanent tax cuts, insanely high spending, and weak job growth is going to reduce the deficit. I mean seriously, reducing your source of income and increasing spending do not go well together.  Seriously, economically-speaking, the Bush administration has been one of the most liberal administrations in recent history. They're almost too liberal for my taste!    Addendum:  By the way, Bush's quote was "We're turning a corner and we're not turning back".   Kind of similar to something another great President said not too long aog: "prosperity is just around the corner". That President was Herbert Hoover and he made that statement during the Great Depression. He was the last President in history to preside over a net job loss.

      Hey officer. Sorry I just fatally hit that old woman while speeding with my SUV. I was on my way to deliver this fresh batch of cookies to the post office. I'm sending them to the troops. I support the troops. What's that? You're arresting me? But officer! You can't arrest me, what about the troops? You INSIST that I step out of the car? That'a outrageous, officer! I'll bet you're French. If you're not French, I'll bet you've been to France. AND YOU LIKED IT THERE! Odds are you like Michael Moore as well (Michael Moore is a socialist pig!). I am reporting you to your supervisor for sympathizing with terrorists, officer. That's basically what you're doing. By not letting me get to the post office, you're depriving the troops of the goods they need to defeat terrorists and A-rabs. How could you?! I know the problem! You're a liberal, aren't you? The downfall of our country. You should be ashamed! Now let me pass, or the terrorists and gays have won! That's right officer. Just go back in your car and pretend this never happened. You  may have let someone that has broken the law go, but you're supporting the troops! God bless you, officer! I'll get these, uhm, cookies to the post office right away!

      What has America come to when perverted religious teachings have infiltrated the state constitutions of the United States?  Recently, Missouri passed an amendment to their constitution banning gay marriage. In November a measure will be on the Oregon ballot attempting to ban gay marriage.  With 60% of Americans favoring a constitutional amendment this will be pass easily.  WHAT THE FUCK!  How could 60% of Americans favor limiting the rights of their fellow citizens.  What is wrong with gay marriage?  I'll tell you what Americans don't like about it: the bible condemns homosexuality.  People feel that they need to subject the rest of our country with their religious views.  The last time I checked the Constitution of the United States of America said that Church and State would not mix.  This has got to be the most blatant violation to our constitution I have ever seen.  We cannot allow a 2000 year old book dictate the way we live.  People have used the bible to protect slavery, and in the 60s some states banned interracial marriage citing the bible as their guiding light.  How foolish Americans will feel in 50 years when we look back at our homophobic actions.  Text books will describe how one president even tried to pass an amendment banning gay marriage.  As an American, I have learned that every person is born with certain inalienable rights, and that everyone should be able to exercise them.  And, today, Americans are trying to stop their fellow citizens from doing so.  "The objection to Puritans is not that they try to make us think as they do, but that they try to  make us do as they think."     -H.L. Mencken

      (click the title)    (as of August 5th)  That's a really interesting site that, instead of viewing polls in terms of the popular vote, breaks them state by state to display them in the way that matters: at the electoral college. According to their projects, Kerry is beating Bush by 70 votes in the electoral college. As you can see though, most of the states Bush has are states that he's holding on to very strongly. He's "strong" in all of them. I think whats going on is that, by adopting such a conservative agenda, Bush is bringing out lots of new voters. Problem is: he's bringing these votes out in the conservative strongholds. He's doing nothing but strengthening and solidifying his base, which can be a good thing for fundraising and campaigning but when it comes to the vote and when it comes to the electoral college, that won't help him. In this country, elections are decided by a select number of swing voters in a select number of states. Those voters don't really care about flip-flopping and all that other mud the Bush campaign is throwing Kerry's way. Unlike conservative voters, who might come out in droves if there are ammendments and initiatives banning same-sex marriage, Bush's increasingly rightist agenda doesn't appeal to them. But that issue still may be a factor since it'll bring out a number of extra conservatives voters who feel really passionately about the issue. Many people seem to neither oppose nor support gay marriage. They just don't care. They'd rather have it but they probably won't come out to the polls to ensure it happens. Many of those who are against it are pretty vehemently against it and WILL come out to vote. That means more votes for Bush.   Or maybe I'm just stereotyping and have no idea what I'm talking about. If that's the case, I'll just shut up and direct everyone at this  urlLink state-by-state breakdown of a much more important issue .

      Look at the sucka Republicans put up to try and bring down Democratic rising-star/juggernaut/heartthrob Barack Obama:    Hmm, I wonder why they picked this man. HMMM.   He ain't winnin' nuthin'. I pity the foo who tries to bring down the Obaminator! The last two suckas who tried got owned.   But seriously, I've heard some pretty impressive stuff about Alan Keyes. Apparantly, he's a master debater (lol) so that ought to be interesting. He's also supposed to be a master election-loser and I hope he decides to utilize that skill in losing his race with Obama. At least this shows that the RNC recognizes the threat Obama will pose to them in the future and has dispatched a somewhat formidable opponent to match him. Now I just hope Obama doesn't dissapoint this early in his career.

      This post will hopefully be a continuation of Sean's post on the other blog.   Sean Major posted this intellectually stimulating and artistically genius comic that he himself drew:   Mr. Major explained his masterpiece by explaining how he had pictured the US as "a slave to foreign oil some say". He understood that the US would always need to import some oil but reasoned that the American "economy doesn't have to be their bitch". He went on to explain how the dependence was not just economic and stipulated that the "dependence has caused just about every brouhaha over there in the Middle East". As a possible alternative, he pointed at oil reserves in "our own backyard" but noted that this sort of an observation wouldn't sit well with "Cheney the Oil Pimp", due to the fact that Mr. Cheney would need "to stack his cheese".   The discussion took off from there. Ryan Moran engaged Mr. Major in tempered political discourse, addressing him as "Sean, you liberal piece of crap" and demanding more clarification about "what kind of fucking alternatives to foreign oil" existed. He then correlated Sean's lack of clarity with the trouble the Democratic party is often cited as having in truly understanding "the issue before making a stand". Mr. Moran continued his scathing indictment with the hope that Mr. Major would be able to wrap "fat head around" the broader complexities of the issue.   At this point, Gus Jewell stepped in noted his agreement with Mr. Major's arguments, not that he had a "good point". He explained that while he agreed the Saudi royal family should not "the American people for profits", he went on to state his dissaproval for Mr. Major and Mr. Moran's suggestion of using "depleting limited oil reserves in Alaska", especially considering the fact that said reserves "only contain enough oil to sustain the United States for 6 months". He then offered other alternative energy proposals, including but not limited to hydrogen power and hybrid cars.   Mr. Jewell also made note of Mr. Major's obvious skill in drawing penises which lead Mr. Major to promptly explain that they are "pretty easy to draw once you get the hang of it". He also doubted Mr. Jewell's "6 months" claim, suggesting that more reserach and investment would yield more positive information.   Mr. Jewell then argued that domestic wildlife reserves should be preserved for as long as is possible, suggesting that we first exhaust Middle Eastern oil sources and than consider alternative fuel sources before choosing to endanger the environment. Domestic oil, he explained, would hardly solve the problem and soon the nation would once again find itself depending on foregin oil if domestic sources were exhausted. H  At this point, Shakeer Rahman joined the discussion and began by pointlessly declaring that he had "missed out on all the action". He then made a candid note of his distress over the fact that the first thing people were considering when brainstorming over "alternative fuel sources" were drilling oil in different places. Instead he suggested that the focus be shifted to true alternative sources such as "wind, solar, biomass, hydrogen cells, whatever". He agreed with Mr. Major and Mr. Jewell's argument that the nation was becoming too dependant on foreign oil and in particular, the Saudi Royal family. He backed up this claim with a few statistics about the extent of the Saudi Royal family's investment in the United States but the validity of these statistics has yet to be confirmed.   Mr. Rahman then shifted the focus of the discussion to oil refineries and explained that refineries were where oil usually got bottlenecked and blamed rising oil prices on refineries, making note of the fact that OPEC oil production was at a 25-year high. He even made note of the fact that "the Saudis have offered to build refineries" in the United States. No one has yet been able to figure out why he felt it neccesary to make note of this fact. He then made the more relevant observation that the royal family "offered to lower the price of oil around election season to help Bush win", promptly adding "I'm not even joking".   Afterwards, Mr. Rahman attempted to discredit all his arguments by noting that he was "more distressed about the power that energy companies have" than he was about "the power that foreign nations have". His arguments, designed to charge up the debate, ending up doing nothing but boring everybody. The post stood still for a few days before Mr. Rahman decided to post one more time. This time, he made note of Mr. Dick Cheney's recent allegations that Democractic Presendential hopefuls John Kerry and John Edwards were to blame for rising oil prices.   He continued with the following quip: "apparantly at a time when the Republican party controls the White House, both Houses of Congress, and have greater ties to oil companies than any other administration in recent history, it's two Democrats that are to blame for hindering their plans". One would imagine that Mr. Rahman took great pleasure in this joke of his. This has yet to be confirmed.     Let's try and continue this debate in the Comments section of this post.

      http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/03/opinion/03krug.html (you need to be registered on nytimes in order ot see that. it's free.)  The following is a very interesting article that, as the titles obviously implies, disseminates the widely-held and long-standing belief that the American media has some kind of huge Leftist slant. It's by Paul Krugman, an economist and writer for the New York Times.   Reading the Script  By PAUL KRUGMAN, August 3, 2004  A message to my fellow journalists: check out media watch sites like campaigndesk.org, mediamatters.org and dailyhowler.com. It's good to see ourselves as others see us. I've been finding The Daily Howler's concept of a media "script," a story line that shapes coverage, often in the teeth of the evidence, particularly helpful in understanding cable news.   For example, last summer, when growth briefly broke into a gallop, cable news decided that the economy was booming. The gallop soon slowed to a trot, and then to a walk. But judging from the mail I recently got after writing about the slowing economy, the script never changed; many readers angrily insisted that my numbers disagreed with everything they had seen on TV.   If you really want to see cable news scripts in action, look at the coverage of the Democratic convention.   Commercial broadcast TV covered only one hour a night. We'll see whether the Republicans get equal treatment. C-Span, on the other hand, provided comprehensive, commentary-free coverage. But many people watched the convention on cable news channels - and what they saw was shaped by a script portraying Democrats as angry Bush-haters who disdain the military.   If that sounds like a script written by the Republicans, it is. As the movie "Outfoxed" makes clear, Fox News is for all practical purposes a G.O.P. propaganda agency. A now-famous poll showed that Fox viewers were more likely than those who get their news elsewhere to believe that evidence of Saddam-Qaeda links has been found, that W.M.D. had been located and that most of the world supported the Iraq war.   CNN used to be different, but Campaign Desk, which is run by The Columbia Journalism Review, concluded after reviewing convention coverage that CNN "has stooped to slavish imitation of Fox's most dubious ploys and policies." Seconds after John Kerry's speech, CNN gave Ed Gillespie, the Republican Party's chairman, the opportunity to bash the candidate. Will Terry McAuliffe be given the same opportunity right after President Bush speaks?   Commentators worked hard to spin scenes that didn't fit the script. Some simply saw what they wanted to see. On Fox, Michael Barone asserted that conventioneers cheered when Mr. Kerry criticized President Bush but were silent when he called for military strength. Check out the video clips at Media Matters; there was tumultuous cheering when Mr. Kerry talked about a strong America.   Another technique, pervasive on both Fox and CNN, was to echo Republican claims of an "extreme makeover" - the assertion that what viewers were seeing wasn't the true face of the party. (Apparently all those admirals, generals and decorated veterans were ringers.)   It will probably be easier to make a comparable case in New York, where the Republicans are expected to feature an array of moderate, pro-choice speakers and keep Rick Santorum and Tom DeLay under wraps. But in Boston, it took creativity to portray the delegates as being out of the mainstream. For example, Bill Schneider at CNN claimed that according to a New York Times/CBS News poll, 75 percent of the delegates favor "abortion on demand" - which exaggerated the poll's real finding, which is that 75 percent opposed stricter limits than we now have.   But the real power of a script is the way it can retroactively change the story about what happened.   On Thursday night, Mr. Kerry's speech was a palpable hit. A focus group organized by Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, found it impressive and persuasive. Even pro-Bush commentators conceded, at first, that it had gone over well.   But a terrorism alert is already blotting out memories of last week. Although there is now a long history of alerts with remarkably convenient political timing, and Tom Ridge politicized the announcement by using the occasion to praise "the president's leadership in the war against terror," this one may be based on real information. Regardless, it gives the usual suspects a breathing space; once calm returns, don't be surprised if some of those same commentators begin describing the ineffective speech they expected (and hoped) to see, not the one they actually saw.   Luckily, in this age of the Internet it's possible to bypass the filter. At c-span.org, you can find transcripts and videos of all the speeches. I'd urge everyone to watch Mr. Kerry and others for yourself, and make your own judgment.    Oh and hello and welcome to the new blog.

      Hi my name is Shakeer. Recognizing the need to shift divisive political content away from my own beloved blog, me, and a few other veterans of my blog, have decided to establish a politics-dedicated blog of our own. I've had this idea for quite a while (in fact, I first made urlLink  misunderestimated.blogspot.com  in November of 2000) but just never felt that anybody really cared or was interested in what people like me had to say about politics and current events (very much unlike how EVERYONE just loves and adores what I have to say on my blog about myself). Recent political posts on the other blog have indicated otherwise. Consequently, I decided to revitalise this old blog. I'm hoping that this blog will ofer not only a channel for us to share information on issues we feel very passionately about but will also become a forum for discussion and sensible debate. In order for the latter to work though, we need your help. We've just begun and in order for this to be succesful, we need people such as yourself to post comments and join in. So please do. Please leave comments and discuss with us. Make sure to tell us who you are when leaving comments though. We wouldn't want to find ourselves debating paper tigers (Gus tends to do that alot). Whatever a paper tiger is.   Also, if you're interested in writing here, please shoot me an email (my address is shakeer(at)gmail.com) or just find and speak to me. Thanks!  And enjoy.

      I am officially resigning from blogging. This has nothing to do with the local politics of this particular blog, I am just sick and tired of the way our country is run, and because of this, I am going to Canada. I am hoping to accomplish several goals: 1. Avoid the draft at all costs (You know its coming) 2. Cheap drugs (probably mostly manufactured in asia) 3. Get the hell out of this country before it gets driven into the ground by our nut-job president. Ok, now for the serious part- I am going to canada for a week for vacation and, as irrelevant as it seems now, I thought it'd be a good idea to record my observations of the observations of the Canadians concerning current American politics. I will watch all sorts of Canadian news, and maybe even talk to some Canadians (I am bringing a video camera, maybe I'll make a  moore wellian documentary or something). So up to now I haven't said much that actually has a place on this blog; but here's the pitch... instead of posting multiple entries concerning whatever I see and hear up there, I will instead continue to post as comments on this entry, thus keeping it all in one place. So if you feel inclined to check up on this over the next week, I hope to have insightful comments about what the Canucks think of us yankees. Stay tuned.

      The following are screenshots I just took of the official websites for the Democractic (dnc.org) and Republican (rnc.org) parties.     urlLink     urlLink     The RNC website has no less than 4 images of Kerry's face plastered across its front page. In fact, those are the only images you see on the top section of the page, aside from all the flags. It seems like the entire focus of that top section of the site is John Kerry, John Kerry's voting record, which bills John Kerry didn't vote for, John Kerry's position on Iraq, and how John Kerry is a "Massachusetts liberal out of touch with America". They even link to FOX news stories, which I guess they just did to add character. Or credibility. I can't figure out which.   The DNC website on the other hand has 1 picture of Kerry on their page. The website has links to ways to contribute to the Kerry campaign, ways to volunteer, and bios of Kerry and Edwards. To the right, it has a link to a thing that "exposes" Bush's record in your state.   Other then that, there a few occurances of the word "Bush" further down the page. I counted four total. This is quite different from the 13 text occurances of the word "Kerry" on the RNC site. That doesn't count mentions in images.  Maybe it's just because my job involves web design and so I have have experienced first-hand how websites are used to achieve marketing goals and how effective a communication tool they can be. That may explain why I'm making such a big deal out of this. But still, I just get sick of always hearing that the Democratic party is the one that's focusing too much on its criticizing its opposition and not enough on defining its own image and platform. Their websites seem to indicate otherwise.

      Ugh.  "Strict regulations published by Athens 2004 last week dictate that spectators may be refused admission to events if they are carrying food or drinks made by companies that did not see fit to sponsor the games. Sweltering sports fans who seek refuge from the soaring temperatures with a soft drink other than one made by Coca-Cola will be told to leave the banned refreshment at the gates or be shut out. High on the list of blacklisted beverages is Pepsi, but even the wrong bottle of water could land spectators in trouble."   "Staff will also be on the lookout for T-shirts, hats and bags displaying the unwelcome logos of non-sponsors. Stewards have been trained to detect people who may be wearing merchandise from the sponsors' rivals in the hope of catching the eyes of television audiences. Those arousing suspicion will be required to wear their T-shirts inside out."

      The article is nothing groundbreaking or revolutionary but I found it to be very well-written and interesting nonetheless. Not to mention somewhat entertaining. Also it sums up the current political and social climate pretty well, albeit from a biased perspective.   Also it's on Esquire.com so if you get bored or disgruntled, there are plenty of photographs of barely clothed women on the site that you can resort to inspecting.

      After the Bush campaign demanded an answer from Kerry about his vote for war in Iraq, he responded that he would, but "would have done this very differently than President Bush has."  He continued by asking a few questions of Bush, according to CNN.com: "My question to President Bush is why did he rush to war without a plan to win the peace?" Kerry asked. "Why did he rush      to war on faulty intelligence and not do the hard work necessary to give America the truth?  Why did he mislead America about how he would go to war? Why has he not brought other countries to the table in order to support American troops in the way that we deserve it and relieve a pressure from the American people?" Well I have a few questions for Kerry as well.  Why did Kerry give Bush war powers without hearing a plan to return sovereignty to Iraq and restore the country?  Why did Kerry (as well as other Senators simply accept the intelegence they were handed, especially in light of the September 11 intelligence failures?  Finally, why did he approve a plan that was bound to cause an uproar in the Middle East and was largely criticized by many countries and US allies?    While I'd like to hear Bush answer the questions directed at him, it would be interesting to hear Kerry respond to a few of mine.

      Today Alan Keyes succesfully seized 13% of total posts on the Misunderestimated blog newswire and effectively established himself as the most posted-about topic. The shift came after Misunderestimed chief editor Shakeer Rahman decided to post a third topic on the twice-unsuccesful candidate for President and Senator of Maryland, his home state. The post came after Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert released his endorsement Mr. Keyes, as  urlLink related by  the  Times :   "I spent five weeks trying to find good people," said Mr. Hastert, who said he approached state legislators and the former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and Gary Fencik, an Ivy Leaguer who was a hard-hitting safety.  "I got down into last week interviewing a 70-year-old guy who was a great farm broadcaster in Illinois," Mr. Hastert said. "He decided because of his health problems he couldn't do it. You know, we were down  we needed to find somebody to run, somebody who wanted to run. And, you know, Alan Keyes wants to run, and I hope he's a good candidate." I'm glad his own party feels so passionately about his candidacy. Of course, I don't blame them, judging by Mr. Keyes' own foolishness and hypocracy, as typified by  urlLink this statement  he made four years ago about Hilary Clinton running for Senatorial office in a state she'd never resided in:  "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness to go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there. So I certainly wouldn't imitate it." Of course, the Illinois Republican party had a statement ready to counterbalance this argument. According to a Republican party official in Illinois (sorry, I don't have a precise quote, I heard it on the radio), the reason that Mr. Keyes had changed his mind was that of all things,  9/11  had changed everything and that considering the current political climate, such a decision was acceptable. 9/11, yeah, that makes sense. Especially considering that one of the deciding factors for Keyes was Obama's stance on  urlLink abortion issues . Yeah, we all know how 9/11 changed the way people view the issue of abortion.   On the other hand, Mr. Keyes did have some other personal convictions in choosing to run against Obama:  "I'll tell you by the time I got through the records, I was convinced that somebody had to run against Barack Obama."  "I must leave the land of my forefathers [i.e., Maryland] in order to defend the land of my spirit, of my conscience and my heart -- and I believe that that land is Illinois."   Uhh yeah, that makes sense. Not really congruent with his earlier statement that he was running despite " urlLink a strong personal resistance ". But yeah Mr. Keyes, whatever you say!

      Fox News is officially my news station of choice. Why? Of course, their obvious conservative filtering and Republican spinning of the propaganda they consider news appeals to my desire to be lied to. Hah! Yeah Right! I actually do enjoy watching the O'Reiley Factor, but comparatively there are few hot women on his show. Yes, I said it. I love watching Fox news because it has the hottest newscasters in the world. Seriously check it out, they're babes.

      I am honored to add my first post to this amzing blog full of insight and talent. I am also pleased to announce the beggining of a new dimension of blogging (if it works). I will bring to the table extensive knowledge of the American political system, my credentials surpassed only by my savvy. I have recently met with some of the key players in our government as well as prominent figures in the American political scene to discuss the status and ramifications of current policy and politics. Names such as Sen. Chuck Hagel, Terry McAuliffe (DNC chairman), Dennis Van Roekel (VP of the NEA), Ron Nessen (Ford's press secretary), Paul V. Kelly (Assistant Sec. of State), Rep. Darlene Hooley (Majority of us are in her district), and Gov. Ted Kulongowski. Yes, some I heard speak, others met personally, one I introduced to a group before a speech. So, while I have stories to tell about them, they aren't even the top sources from who I have gained political knowledge and expertise (though the most famous). Anyway, I am liberal- but I play devil's advocate very well, if only for the sake of argument. So with that, I feel I have much to add in the coming election year and beyond. I am called to report my opinions and ideas to this blog, not for my own ego, (though that laundry list of politicans was kinda egotistical) but rather because it is my duty. My duty to the blogging community, to ignorant Democrats and fire-breathing Republicans, and to America at large. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I announce; this is Jack Arriaga "Reporting... for duty" (I also enjoy puns, sarcasm, and irony in my writing)

      This is an official press release: This actually has never happened before, but we are going to invite Jimmy on to the blogging team after only a couple of comments.  I'm sorry to those of you who have waited your whole lives to write for Misunderestimated, but Jimmy has shown promise and he will bring his sarcastic-conservative-liberal views to the table.  May the blog be with you.

      If this turns out to be a legitimate claim on Kerry's part and the FEC rules that the Bush campaign illegally used those 527 groups, it could put a major dent in the Bush campaign's credibility.   It's starting to look like the Kerry campaign might have a point though. After all, look at  urlLink ">this story  about a former Bush campaign advisor quitting after appearing in the ad.  Also,  urlLink here  is a fellow Swift Boat commander is breaking 35 years of silence to defend Kerry's record:  Oh and while I'm at it,  urlLink here  is a report by one of the people in the ad filed 35 years ago that seems to contract his current. In the report, he describes Kerry as "highly courageous in the face of enemy fire" and reported that Kerry "several enemy initiated fire fights" and "exhibited all of the traits desired of an officer in a combat environment." These are all claims things that he says Kerry is making up in the SBVFT ad.   Finally, if that isn't enough ownage, another one of the most prominent voices in the SBVFT campaign, Larry Thurlow reported that their boats were under enemy fire but now, three decades later, is now claiming that Kerry lied about all their being under enemy fire. Oops!  On the other hand, I'm sure the conservatives will be lining up evidence of how Kerry DID lie and how these brave men have been persecuted by the liberal media for years and finally have the ability to voice their opinions but are being suppressed and criticized for revealing the truth (after all, their name DOES have the word truth in it, so it has to be true).  So I guess basically, this whole issue is going to come down to who you want to believe veterans who actually served with Kerry and were present during the actual incidents and volunteered to participate in his campaign at their own expense (some of which even come from Republican backgrounds) or veterans who served on other boats near Kerry's and are relying on implication and claims that they suddenly have changed accounts of the events that they felt most appropiate to reveal right now, while being paid by Houston Republicans to campaign against Kerry and earning a portion of the profits from the group's book sales for their participation.   I choose the former.

      A close glance at the Healthy Forest Initiative (HFI) will show an acceptable solution to the growing wildfire problem.  However, with HFI and all other Bush legislation it does exactly the opposite of what Bush will have you believe.  Bush says that HFI will reduce wildfires by removing forests and brush near populated areas.  This sounds reasonable, but if you think for a second about what the initiative is saying, it sounds ridiculous.  Bush is passing an initiative that will allow lumber companies to log entire forests and at the same time making people believe he is making the forest more healthy.  Some of you are thinking, but it probably does help the forest because it reduces wildfires, but do you think Bush gives a shit about the forests?  Why should he?  All previous legislation would lead me to believe he would harvest every last tree in the United States until we were renamed (New Scotland, if you get this joke good for you, but it is a bit obscure).  The truth is Bush is catering to the lumber companies not the environmentalists.  He is just helping his lumber buddies log forests that they have not been able to get.

      Does anyone get the feeling that the olympics revolve around the US? I dunno, I figured I'd leave it to those who feel like commenting to fuel the majority of this "debate" or post, but I just see an unfortunate amount of politics playing in the Olympics, and it usually seems to be the result of, if not directed at, America. Example- I can't watch a single event without hearing easily recognizable American music playing in the background, including Blur's 'Song 2', the Beach Boys, Louie Louie, 'We Will Rock You' by Queen, etc. In fact, the only time I don't hear American music playing was during the gymnastic floor routines by Lithuania, Ukraine, etc. Plus you have the corporate sponsorship element that was adressed earlier in this blog. Also, did anyone catch the whole thing about Aaron Pierson's DQ after he won gold in the (I think it was the) 100m. Basically, he got DQ'd for some technicality, but it was overturned when an investigation found that the complaint hadn't been properly filed. One of the main reasons? It wasn't written in English. Well, I guess they might have chosen English because it really is the true language of the Olympic Games. In fact, it has been since its inception thousands of years ago (back me up here, Gus). Seriously though, maybe English as the official language may make things easier for logistic purposes, but that's not the end of the politics of this affair. According to one of Pierson's competitors (and long-time friends-also interestingly the runner-up who would have received gold had the DQ stood), the DQ was politically driven; it was a "punishment" or "retaliation" for something that Pierson had said (apparently concerning a Japanese swimmer). Anyway... there are probably more examples of this- American overbearing and interference in the Olympics (Think Bush's ads that "Thanks to Democracy and Liberty, two new "free" countries, Iraq and Afghanistan, can compete in the Olympics") so feel free to chip in with your two cents (or tell me why I am wrong, whichever).

      Nobody has been able to give me something good that Bush has done.  I'm disappointed.  Are you guys just bored or is it true that he has done NOTHING!  I'm thinking its the latter.

      Hello, I'm Ben and I've been talking politics will Shakeer for as far back as I can remember.  Which is last October.  Those who know me know that I am liberal, exceedingly liberal.  Politicalcompass.com put me as more economically and socially liberal than Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.  But I am here, officially announcing I am switching teams.  Ryan has been the lone voice for too long.  I will use all my God-given skills of argument and logic to balance this blog.  My goal is to make this blog become a microcosm of the United States Congress, so evenly divided on almost every issue that nothing ever gets accomplished unless polls show that 99% of voters (you, the readers) are behind a certain bill.  So my first act as blog contributor will be to praise President Bush and his wildfire policy.  His Healthy Forest Initiative is a welcome break from the chokehold well-meaning but misguided environmentalists have on our forest policy through appeals and so forth.  There are 750 million acres of national forests and last year alone we lost 11 million.  And from the research I have seen, huge tracts of burnt forests do not grow back like in some people's majestic, "circle of life" pipedream.  More hazardous bushes (yes, I know its ironic) grow because they are the fastest and block out the sun for the saplings.  We protect such a huge portion of our country indefinately for our national heritage, but the majority of these forests are roadless areas that few ever see.  Logging such areas is taking advantage of a renewable resource.  It is a boon to the economy, not just directly for jobs for cutting the trees down, but for the struggling mill towns and ports that will be revitalized by this wise use of what we have.  And we have control over what stays and goes, so we can leave less fireprone old growth and plant new trees from where we harvested.  Environmentalists just can't see the forest for the trees.  We're lucky President Bush can.

      If you don't know who to vote for or your thoughts have been clouded by the dark side, this question may help you reflect.  If you are going to reelect someone you should be able to instantly think of things they have done that are good.  When I think of Bush, I cannot think of one good thing he has done.  Now, I know some of you are thinking Bush has done some good things like....  WAR ON TERROR The invasion of Afghanistan was a very necessary step in the war on terror.  We managed to disrupt Al-Qaeda cells in Afghanistan and remove the Taliban, however the mission in Afghanistan was lost with the invasion of Iraq.  No matter how much Fox News tells you, the invasion of Iraq has nothing to do with the war on terror.  Saddam Hussein was not harboring terrorists and Iraq was one of the least terrorist laced countries in the Middle East.  So why the hell did we invade Iraq? Why didn't we invade Syria, Libya, Iran, Saudi Arabia.  Those would have been much better targets in the war on terror.  So, Bush's invasion of Iraq took all of the focus away from Afghanistan where the real terrorist threat was.  We only have 20,000 troops in Afghanistan and the troops only control Kabul, the capital.  The rest of the country is ruled by warlords and many terrorists have slipped through our fingers.  American troops have been spread thin with Bush's war in Iraq and the true war on terror in Afghanistan is being lost.  So, fighting terror Bush has done a piss poor job.  He's done some good, but think about how much more effective our troops could be in Afghanistan fighting actual terrorists.  NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND Bush didn't even fund his own program. FAIL.  AMERICAN VALUES This is my favorite category, because this is one of the biggest reasons why people vote for Bush.  They feel he promotes good Christian values, honesty, honor, trustworthiness, integrity.  I could cite many times when the Bush administration lied, cheated, killed, and war-mongered.  Those sound like great values.  Just because someone mentions God and goes to church doesn't mean they are upholding AMERICAN VALUES.  True American values are telling the truth to the people, upholding the constitution, and not using the Supreme Court to win elections.  TAX CUTS Many will say that the Bush tax cuts were a great product from the administration.  If you are in the top 2% of the country they will save you a couple thousand dollars.  Is it fair that the rich people who can afford to pay the taxes should be the ones receiving the breaks.  Huge corporations get ridiculous tax breaks, some only pay a dollar in taxes a year.  This is not fair.  Also, tax cuts are not a good idea during a time of war.  There have never been tax breaks during war.  Bush has managed to help the rich and increase the deficit.  Success?  Hmm, no.  ENVIRONMENT Some will cite Bush's environmental actions as successes.  For example, his Clean Air Initiative which does exactly opposite of what it says.  In fact, Bush's Clean Air Initiative allows huge corporations to pollute more.  It doesn't make the Air cleaner it just makes it dirtier.  Bush just deceives people by putting the "Clean Air" label on a bill that allows companies to pollute more.  I'm sure some of you will find small things that Bush has done that are good, but if you honestly cannot think of something that he has done good off the top of your head then why are you voting for him?  Its time to let someone else try to run this country.

      Many democrats have been mentioning President Bush's ads lately.  Some even link them to 527 groups that are illegally funded by Bush, himself.  Kerry recently filed an injunction to have the 527 group behind a recent anti-Kerry ad be investigated for fraudulent funding.  If found guilty, it could be a devastating hit to the Bush campaign.  What's so interesting about this situation, however, is the fact that this is not the first time that something like this has happened.  Lets go back in time to December of 2003. Dean is still in the race, in fact, he looks to be the forerunner.  John Kerry is but a blip on the radar map.  He is known for his extreme liberalism, and his military valor in Vietnam (sound familiar).  This is before the famous yell, and Dean's fall from the top.  Saddam Hussein had just been captured, and all the democratic campaigns were preparing for the up-coming primaries. It was at this time that a 527 group called Americans for Jobs, Healthcare and Progressive Values debuted an  urlLink Anti-Dean Ad  that started the doctor's fall from the top.   urlLink Later , the group behind the ad was linked to both the Kerry, and Gephardt campaigns.  Dean did not retaliate because he felt that such ads took away from his message.  Now, I wonder where Kerry got the idea that the two organizations might be connected in this new ad.

      From the   urlLink Post  :  Underscoring how personal the dispute has become, Bush's campaign chairman, Marc Racicot, went on CNN and said the Kerry campaign has come "unhinged," and that Kerry himself "looks wild-eyed." Earlier yesterday, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Kerry is "losing his cool." In 2000, the Bush campaign used similar language to portray rival Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) as potentially too unstable to run the country.  Luckily, the Post goes on to detail how unsurprisingly ineffective these tactics have been.
