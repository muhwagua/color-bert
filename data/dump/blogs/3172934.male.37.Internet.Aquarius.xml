      An interesting message I'd like to share.   Dear Rebecca,    Already, the major networks are raising their biased heads. Coverage of the brutal massacre of Nick Berg is being pushed aside in order for liberal networks to continue pounding anti-terrorism war efforts by incessant repetition of the Abu Ghraib prison-abuse story, despite the swift response by the military to begin investigations and court-martials immediately. 	   Within 24 hours, ABC and NBC quickly diminished their reporting of the barbaric death of Nick Berg, just as they did with the atrocious crimes against other Americans.  	   Gary Bauer, chairman of Campaign for Working Families, points out the media's pre-occupation with pushing anti-war rhetoric. "The press wants us to see every photo from the prison, but they try to hide the handiwork of our enemy." 	   A study by Media Research Center (MRC) indicates networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC will completely bury the Berg story soon to refocus on efforts to oust Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. In fact, on Monday, NBC made a conscious effort to belittle Rumsfeld by airing a comparison of him to Adolph Hitler.  	   The MRC study reports NBC's morning and evening news shows aired 58 prisoner-abuse stories since April 29. In all of 2003 and 2004, NBC aired only five stories on the mass graves discovered after the fall of Saddam Hussein, despite an estimated body count of as many as 300,000. 	   Let the major networks know you want them to be as vigilant about covering the murder of Nick Berg and other Americans as they have in coverage of Iraqi prisoner abuse. Tell them the horrendous abuses against Americans deserve the same amount of media coverage too!    Send your  urlLink  letter   to ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN now!  Sincerely,  Don  Donald E. Wildmon, Founder and Chairman  urlLink  American Family Association    P.S. Please forward this message to at least one friend.   These actions by the media only embolden our enemies. The time for appeasement is over...

They had to wear underwear and parade around naked. So terryfying, womens underwear. Give me a break.  I guess that's worse than hanging mutilated, burned bodies from a bridge. Where is all the outrage about that. Why don't we see those pictures on TV? Whose side is the media on anyway?

"Ladies and gentlemen, the lower economic people are not holding up their end in this deal," he declared. "These people are not parenting. They are buying things for kids -- $500 sneakers for what? And won't spend $200 for 'Hooked on Phonics.' . . .   "They're standing on the corner and they can't speak English," he exclaimed. "I can't even talk the way these people talk: 'Why you ain't,' 'Where you is' . . . And I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk. And then I heard the father talk. . . . Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. . . . You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth!"

I read this and thought it would be good to share. One Public Enemy #1 down, several more to go. And we defeated this one with Rock music and the rock of the Church.   "'God can forgive the worst sinner on earth.' How many times have you heard a preacher say something like that? Or, 'God loves everyone. He doesn�t want anyone to perish. There is no sinner too sinful for God to forgive, if that person will repent and come to Christ in faith.' And do we believe it? Of course we do. We believe that Jesus Christ would have forgiven Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Him, if he would have truly repented."   urlLink The Conversion of Manuel Noriega :

The discovery of the nerve agent, reported yesterday by a team that has been searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq since shortly after last year's U.S.-led invasion, marked the first time the team has found one of the types of weapons that the Bush administration cited as initial justification for toppling the government of Saddam Hussein.  But weapons experts cautioned that the shell appeared to predate the 1991 Persian Gulf War and did not necessarily mean that Hussein possessed hidden stockpiles of chemical munitions.

       Want a Different Abu Ghraib Story?    So - Where is this story on the news, or in the US editorial sections? Have we forgotten how brutal Saddam was. Panties on the head and naked pyramids vs. hands cut off and general dismemberment? Which is torture, which is hazing? When is hazing torture?  This is an excellent, inspiring read, that reminds us of what America is all about. We need to be telling these stories to the Iraqis, to counter balance what they hear on Arab TV. I'll leave you with the first part of the story...   BY  urlLink DANIEL HENNINGER  taken from WSJ.com - Opinion Journal - Friday, May 14, 2004   By now, some Americans may feel the need for respite from the images of Abu Ghraib and the five hooded barbarians standing behind Nick Berg. This week's column will try to provide some measure of respite.   It is the story of Americans, in and out of the U.S. government, who moved mountains to help seven horribly maimed Iraqi men. It is not always pleasant reading, but there are rewards to staying with it, especially now.   Quite obviously it has been decided, as the handling of the Abu Ghraib story makes plain, that when America stumbles, we are going to have our faces rubbed in it. And rubbed in it and rubbed in it. As far as I can make out, the purpose of this two weeks of media humiliation is that we--the president, all of us--are being asked to morally prostrate ourselves before the rest of the world. Some may choose to do so, but this story should make a few Americans want to simply stand up straight again.  As perfect justice, the story in fact begins in Abu Ghraib prison, in 1995. With Iraq's economy in a tailspin, Saddam arrested nine Iraqi businessmen to scapegoat them as dollar traders. They got a 30-minute "trial," and were sentenced, after a year's imprisonment, to have their right hands surgically cut off at Abu Ghraib prison.   The amputations were performed, over two days, by a Baghdad anesthesiologist, a surgeon and medical staff. We know this because Saddam had a videotape made of each procedure. He had the hands brought to him in formalin and then returned to Abu Ghraib. Oh, one more thing: The surgeon carved an X of shame into the forehead of each man. And the authorities charged the men $50.

      Ok, this is something Scott and I discussed the other week, and its total BS. I have heard in the past how taxes effect prices, and now how these blends are doing it ...WRONG. If this is the reason for the high prices, why have prices not remained stable over the past few weeks?? Why are they raising every week?? are these laws changing every week to tax the oil companies?? Hell NO!!! Nothing gets done in congress in a day or two except changing Jesse Helms' depends, so no that isn't the case. And these regulation started in the 1970's under the Carter admin with direct input from Iowa Senator Tom Harkin...look it up. The CAFE standards. Oil prices must be to blame, but actually that’s bs too as the gas you get today was the oil they bought a few months ago and had to refine to what you are buying now, so the high prices now are artificial because the oil bought months ago when prices were lower are what’s in your car today. SO what is the answer...oil is evil and supported by Nazi republicans. They are greedy bastards and if I could go back to horse and buggy I would. Michael Moore is right...about everything, even though it has nothing to do with this I just wanted to say it!!!

      Shortly after reading the following e-mail content, I happened to look at the label of a jar of Heinz sandwich slice pickles. Yep...."Made in Mexico" Check some of your Heinz products. Sen. John Kerry keeps talking about U.S. corporations leaving this country and setting up shop in foreign countries, taking thousands of jobs with them. He is right, because that has happened.    However, he is trying to blame it on George W. Bush. Can you name one company Bush has moved one factory out of this country?  (Bush does not own one single company or factory) That cannot be said about Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz-Kerry.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the Kerry's own 32 factories in Europe and 18 in Asia and the Pacific. In addition, their company, the Heinz Company, leases four factories in Europe and four in Asia. Also, they own 27 factories in North America, some of which are in Mexico and the Caribbean.  Wonder how many hundreds of American workers lost their jobs when these plants relocated in foreign countries? Also wonder if the workers in Mexico and Asia are paid the same wages and benefits as workers in the United States? (please take 3 guesses) Of course they're not.    However, Kerry demands that other companies that relocate should pay the same benefits they did in the U.S. Why does he not  demand this of the Heinz Company, since he is married to the owner?  If Kerry is elected, will he and his wife close all those foreign factories and bring all those jobs back to America? Of course they won't. They're making millions off that cheap labor.

       urlLink Americans for Fair Tax   Simply put, the FairTax replaces the way we're currently taxed - based on our annual income - with a tax on goods and services. The FairTax is a voluntary “consumption" tax: the more you buy, the more you pay in taxes, the less you buy, the less you pay in taxes.  It's simple.  Everyone pays their fair share of taxes, and with the FairTax rebate, spending up to the poverty level is tax free. The Federal government is fully funded, including Social Security and Medicare, and you don't need an expert to determine your Federal taxes.  It's simple.

        Beautifully landscaped MacArthur Square in downtown Norfolk, Virginia is the site of the four buildings that comprise the General Douglas MacArthur Memorial.    The Memorial's theater contains several  urlLink special exhibit galleries  and continuously shows a twenty-four minute film on the life and times of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, one of the most colorful and controversial men in American history. The Jean MacArthur Research Center (named after the General's widow) houses the  urlLink library and archives , an  urlLink education wing , and the administrative offices for the MacArthur Memorial and the  urlLink General Douglas MacArthur Foundation.  The  urlLink gift shop  displays General MacArthur's 1950 Chrysler Imperial limousine which he used from 1950 to the end of his life.   The  urlLink museum proper is housed in Norfolk's stately nineteenth century City Hall. A monumental rotunda is the General's and Mrs. MacArthur's final resting place where they are surrounded by inscriptions, banners, and flags heralding the general's long and glorious career. Nine separate galleries arranged in two levels circle the rotunda and tell the story of General MacArthur and the millions of American men and women who served in the United States Armed Forces from the Civil War through the Korean War.   A visit to the MacArthur Memorial provides a unique glimpse into the 20th century and can renew your faith in those American values of Duty-Honor-Country, values which motivated Douglas MacArthur as he served our nation through some of its greatest crises and finest hours.

      This must take a special kind of person.  1. How many steps does the guard take during his walk across the tomb of the Unknowns and why?   21 steps. It alludes to the twenty-one gun salute, which is the highest honor given any military or foreign dignitary.  2. How long does he hesitate after his about face to begin his return walk and why?   21 seconds for the same reason as answer number 1.  3. Why are his gloves wet?   His gloves are moistened to prevent his losing his grip on the rifle.  4. Does he carry his rifle on the same shoulder all the time, and if not, why not?   He carries the rifle on the shoulder away from the tomb.  After his march across the path, he executes an about face, and moves the rifle to the outside shoulder.  5. How often are the guards changed?   Guards are changed every thirty minutes, twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year.  6. What are the physical traits of the guard limited to?   For a person to apply for guard duty at the tomb, he must be between 5' 10" and 6' 2" tall and his waist size cannot exceed 30."   Other requirements of the Guard:    They must commit 2 years of life to guard the tomb, live in a barracks under the tomb, and cannot drink any alcohol on or off duty for the rest of their lives. They cannot swear in public for the rest of their lives and cannot disgrace the uniform {fighting} or the tomb in any way.  After two years, the guard is given a wreath pin that is worn on their lapel signifying they served as guard of the tomb. There are only 400 presently worn.  The guard must obey these rules for the rest of their lives or give up the wreath pin.  The shoes are specially made with very thick soles to keep the heat and cold from their feet. There are metal heel plates that extend to the top of the shoe in order to make the loud click as they come to a halt. There are no wrinkles, folds or lint on the uniform.  Guards dress for duty in front of a full-length mirror.  The first six months of duty a guard cannot talk to anyone, nor watch TV.  All off duty time is spent studying the 175 notable people laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. A guard must memorize who they are and where they are interred. Among the notables are: President Taft, Joe E. Lewis {the boxer} and Medal of Honor winner Audie Murphy, {the most decorated soldier of WWII} of Hollywood fame.  Every guard spends five hours a day getting his uniforms ready for guard duty.    ETERNAL REST GRANT THEM O LORD,  AND LET PERPETUAL LIGHT SHINE UPON THEM.   I don't know if you saw this in the news but it really impressed me.  On the ABC evening news, it was reported tonight that, because of the dangers from Hurricane Isabelle approaching Washington DC, the military members assigned the duty of guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier were given permission to suspend the assignment.  They respectfully declined the offer, "No way, Sir!"  Soaked to the skin, marching in the pelting rain of a tropical storm, they said that guarding the Tomb was not just an assignment, it was the highest honor that can be afforded to a serviceperson.  The tomb has been patrolled continuously, 24/7, since 1930.  We can be very proud of our young men and women in the service no matter where they serve.   God Bless them.

       "Ronald Reagan 'tortured' blacks."   One Sunday morning, as I drove to my local tennis court to play a match, I heard a black radio commentator give that assessment of the now late, great 40th president. Imagine my conflict. After all, here I am, about to selfishly work on my backhand, while having allowed Reagan to busy himself by "torturing" members of my race.    The Reagan-hated-blacks routine resurfaced during the week of his memorial services and tributes. This indictment includes the following charges: he cut social spending; he showed his latent racism by supporting Bob Jones University; he gave a states' rights speech in Philadelphia, Miss., where three civil rights workers were killed; he "insulted" the lone black member of his Cabinet; he opposed race-based preferences; he again demonstrated racial insensitivity by pursuing a policy of "constructive engagement" with the apartheid regime of South Africa; he attempted to fire the black female chair of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.

      June 16, 2004 -- WASHINGTON — Top Republicans in John Kerry's home state of Massachusetts yesterday urged him to resign from the Senate to run for president — because he's there so rarely, he has missed 88 percent of Senate votes.  "It's not fair, it's not right and the public is not being well-served," complained Republican Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey.   She issued the quit-now call on behalf of Republican Gov. Mitt Romney — who would get to name Kerry's temporary replacement if he did quit his $158,100-a-year Senate job.   Kerry shot back, "I'm running for president because we have to put this country back into a place of responsible leadership. And I believe that I'm serving the citizens of Massachusetts and the country in the proposals that I've laid out."   In 2000, then-Texas Gov. George Bush reimbursed his state a day's salary for every day that he was campaigning out of state and then-Lt. Gov. Rick Perry had to step in as acting governor.   Kerry so far this year has missed 98 of 112 roll-call votes, including votes to extend jobless benefits and toughen nuclear cleanup where his absence meant the measures lost.   Kerry also missed a recent unanimous vote for $25 billion for Iraq construction after pledging to support it.  In 1996, Republican Sen. Bob Dole (Kan.) resigned his Senate seat — and his powerful post as Senate GOP leader — shortly before he formally accepted the Republican nomination for president.   Meanwhile, Kerry and Bush engaged in a spin war over whether the news from the economy is good or bad.   Kerry, speaking in Atlantic City, accused Bush of saddling the middle class "with endless debt and deficits" and vowed to hike taxes on the rich "to put America's tax code in line with our moral code."   Bush, at a news conference, said the economy is strong and added: "I guess if you want to try to find something to be pessimistic about, you can find it no matter how hard you look, you know?"

      I always write my own, but I thought I would put a tease on today..about one of my favorite directors and people mainly because, whether you agree with him or not , you know him and he says out loud, over a PA system, loud, what people don't want to hear. They may think it, may not, but they definitely do not want to hear it all the time, and its all the time with this guy.   Kind of like another Moore we all know and love.   The crowd that gave Michael Moore's controversial 'Fahrenheit 9/11' documentary a standing ovation last night at the Ziegfeld Theatre premiere certainly didn't have to be encouraged at all to show their appreciation. From liberal radio host and writer Al Franken to actor/director Tim Robbins, Moore was in his element.

       As young Iowa sportscaster, 'the Gipper' confronted would-be robber with .45   "Leave her alone or I'll shoot you right between the shoulders!"  A line from a Clint Eastwood movie or other classic Western? Or a tough-guy line from a cop show?  No. It's Ronald Reagan – not as a movie star, but in real life – facing down a bad guy as a young man, just as he did later in life with various world leaders, tyrants and dictators.  More than 70 years ago, as IowaChannel.com reports, long-time Iowa resident Melba King was a 22-year-old nursing student.  The year was 1933, and on a hot, humid autumn night, as Melba was strolling home in downtown Des Moines, she felt a gun in her back. A mugger had stolen up behind her and was demanding money.  But someone was watching out for Melba – a young Des Moines radio sportscaster named Ronald Wilson Reagan who had overheard the confrontation and immediately sprang to her rescue. Reagan pointed a .45-caliber revolver at the would-be robber from the window of the second-story rented room he lived in.  "And he said, 'Leave her alone or I'll shoot you right between the shoulders,'" King recently told KCCI-TV."  The scared mugger ran off, and Reagan went out to comfort King and walk her home.  "You stay right where you are, and I'll go get my robe and slippers and walk over with you," the youthful Reagan told her, according to King's vivid recollection.  Decades passed. The next time King saw Reagan was more than 50 years later, in 1984, when Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad asked her to attend a Republican campaign event.  Embracing on stage, Reagan laughed as he quipped to the audience and King: "This is the first time I've had a chance to tell you – the gun was empty! I didn't have any cartridges! If he hadn't run when I told him to, I was going to have to throw it at him!"  Staying in touch over the years, King's and Reagan's families exchanged birthday and Christmas cards, and comforted one another during hard times.  "The Reagans helped King when she lost her husband Harold in 1987," said the Iowa news outlet, "and now she will send Nancy Reagan a sympathy note."    - © 2004 WorldNetDaily.com

      For a country founded on  urlLink Judeo-Christian beliefs , It amazes me how far we have strayed. We our founding fathers that misguided? I don't think so.  Did you know that 52 of the 55 signers of the  urlLink Declaration of Independence  were orthodox, deeply committed Christians? The other three all believed in the Bible as the divine truth, the God of scripture, and His personal intervention.   It is the same Congress that formed the American Bible Society. Immediately after creating the  urlLink Declaration of Independence , the Continental Congress voted to purchase and import 20,000 copies of scripture for the people of this nation.   Patrick Henry, who is called the firebrand of the American Revolution, is still remembered for his words,   "Give me liberty or give me death."   But in current textbooks the context of these words is deleted. Here is what he actually said:   "An appeal to arms and the God of hosts is all that is left us. But we shall not fight our battle alone. There is a just God that presides over the destinies of nations. The battle sir, is not to the strong alone. Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it almighty God. I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death."  These sentences have been erased from our textbooks. Was Patrick Henry a Christian? The following year, 1776, he wrote this:  "It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great Nation was founded not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For that reason alone, people of other faiths have been afforded freedom of worship here."  Consider these words that Thomas Jefferson wrote on the front of his well-worn Bible:  "I am a real Christian, that is to say, a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus. I have little doubt that our whole country will soon be rallied to the unity of our Creator..."  He was also the chairman of the American Bible Society, which he considered his highest and most important role.   On July 4, 1821, President Adams said:  "The highest glory of the American Revolution was this: it connected in one indissoluble bond the principles of civil government with the principles of Christianity."  Calvin Coolidge, our 30th President of the United States reaffirmed this truth when he wrote:  "The foundations of our society and our government rest so much on the teachings of the Bible that it would be difficult to support them if faith in these teachings would cease to be practically universal in our country."  In 1782, the United States Congress voted this resolution:  "The Congress of the United States recommends and approves the Holy Bible for use in all schools."   William Holmes McGuffey is the author of the McGuffey Reader, which was used for over 100 years in our public schools with over 125 million copies sold until it was stopped in 1963. President Lincoln called him the  "Schoolmaster of the Nation."  Listen to these words of Mr. McGuffey:   "The Christian religion is the religion of our country. From it are derived our notions on the character of God, on the great moral Governor of the universe. On its doctrines are founded the peculiarities of our free institutions. From no source has the author drawn more conspicuously than from the sacred Scriptures. From all these extracts from the Bible I make no apology."  Of the first 108 universities founded in America, 106 were distinctly Christian, including the first, Harvard University, chartered in 1636. In the original Harvard Student Handbook, rule number 1 was that students seeking entrance must know Latin and Greek so that they could study the scriptures:  "Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well, the main end of his life and studies is, to know God and Jesus Christ, which is eternal life, John 17:3; and therefore to lay Jesus Christ as the only foundation for our children to follow the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.  James Madison, the primary author of the Constitution of the United States, said this:  "We have staked the whole future of our new nation not upon the power of government; far from it. We have staked the future of all our political constitutions upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments."   Today, we are asking God to bless America. But, how can He bless a Nation that has departed so far from Him? Prior to September 11, He was not welcome in America. Most of what you read in this article has been erased from our textbooks. Revisionists have rewritten history to remove the truth about our country's Christian roots.  God Bless America.

The U.S. economy grew much more slowly than previously thought in the first quarter while inflation was higher, a government report showed on June 25, 2004. The surprise downward revision to gross domestic product -- which measures total output within the nation's borders -- cut growth to a 3.9 percent annual rate in the first three months of 2004 from the 4.4 percent reported a month ago and below the 4.1 percent pace in the final quarter of last year.

(His ski resort home in Idaho is an old barn brought over from Europe in pieces. Not your average A-frame).  Bush paid $250,000 in taxes this year; Kerry paid $90,000. Does that sound right? The man who wants to raise your taxes obviously has figured out a way to avoid paying his own.  Please Mr. Kerry, practice what you preach.

Please go  urlLink here  and send a message telling the Bureau of Land Management to shelve its proposed plan for industrializing this unique and fragile wildland.  Located at the southern end of the Rockies, Otero Mesa boasts uninterrupted expanses of Chihuahuan desert grasslands, one of North America's most endangered ecosystems and crucial habitat for pronghorn antelope, mule deer and the black-tailed prairie dog.  All told, Otero Mesa is home to more than 20 species protected by the Endangered Species Act, including the Mexican spotted owl, the southwestern willow flycatcher, the Aplomado falcon and the black-footed ferret.  In its rush to let energy companies plunder America's Rocky Mountain landscapes, the Bush administration is about to finalize a plan that would permit oil and gas development throughout the Otero Mesa ecosystem. The  resulting invasion of new roads, pipelines, transmission lines and hundreds of wells would devastate its irreplaceable wildlife habitat and wilderness characteristics.  The Bush administration is accepting public comments on its proposed development plan through June 28th.  Visit  urlLink here  to tell the Bush administration not to sacrifice this magnificent piece of our natural heritage to oil and gas interests.  Sincerely,  John H.

      My brother Brian Lindoerfer, recently returned from Iraq last week.  A military article was written about his battalion from California.  After reading the article, the Philadelphia Inquirer decided to do a piece on the native NJ man.  It has been a long six months of praying, wondering and hoping for the safety of Brian and his return.  He is home safe, he has performed his duties by helping others and we are very proud of him.    Americans soldier on to improve Iraqis' lives  Infrastructure work continues despite insurgent attacks     By Edward Colimore - Inquirer Staff Writer   When Army First Lt. Yash Sinha of Bordentown arrived in Iraq last year to help oversee repairs of water and sanitation systems, he had no idea of the daunting task ahead.  He found sewage running in the streets of Kirkuk and surrounding villages, broken water lines, polluted wells - and Iraqis suffering from cholera, diarrhea and E. coli.  Navy Lt. Brian Lindoerfer, a Pitman native, ran into a few surprises, too, in the last six months while assessing the condition of coalition buildings used in support of the reconstruction efforts.  Everywhere, the infrastructure was run-down and outdated. And making matters worse is the rising number of insurgent attacks in the run-up to the June 30 transfer of sovereignty.  But Lindoerfer and Sinha said the setbacks would not stop the reconstruction of Iraq. They said U.S. troops were battling guerrillas not just with bullets but also with billions of dollars in infrastructure projects that provide jobs for the people and hope for the future.  In just the next three months, a half-billion dollars will be poured into Baghdad's poorest neighborhoods, Army officials said last week.  "I'm optimistic that things will be better for the people there," said Sinha, 29, a reservist who returned home in March and now works as a civilian engineer at the Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, N.J.  "About 80 percent of the Iraqis are very happy Americans are there. They were glad to see me because they know I was trying to improve their lives."  Sinha said he had helped increase the flow of the long-neglected water and sewer systems in Kirkuk from about 50 percent capacity to nearly 80 percent and in the surrounding villages from about 15 percent to 50 percent. He also worked on systems in Baghdad, helping to improve their flow from 70 percent to up to 90 percent.  "There wasn't a lot of media coverage in the places like Kirkuk because the risks were higher," said Sinha, a doctoral student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark who has degrees in chemical engineering and industrial hygiene as well as occupational safety. "The needs were greater in the villages."  Last week, explosions at oil pipelines in southern Iraq shut down oil exports. In other areas, power pylons have been toppled, business districts targeted by car bombers, and foreign engineers gunned down.  But Sinha said progress could be measured in many ways. Before he arrived in February 2003, some villages depended on wells with poor water. They now have water systems.  "I worked with local engineers to design systems and choose the kinds of pipes, and found contractors to satisfy the requirements," he said. "The mood of people was so great because their towns had been neglected. They knew we had come from far away to help them, and they'd say, 'Nobody did this for us.' A lot of them didn't have jobs, and now they have them."  Sinha and other troops used a former Iraqi intelligence compound in Kirkuk as their operation center. "One of the buildings had been used for torture," he said.  Sinha was later assigned to Baghdad, where he marveled at lavish palaces built by Saddam Hussein at a time when Iraq's infrastructure was crumbling. From there, he broadened his efforts, overseeing improvements of water and sewer systems across the country.  "We color-coded all of Iraq to show which areas needed the most help," he said. "Then we flow money and resources to those areas.  "In the end, Iraq has problems that will take time to fix, not a year or two, but decades."  Lindoerfer also said he saw the rebuilding of Iraq as a long-term project, "but doable."  A graduate of Pitman High School and the Naval Academy, Lindoerfer spent six months in Iraq, heading a unit of 12 Seabees who assessed reconstruction needs and provided security. He returned to the United States last week.  "It's going to be a matter of time," said Lindoerfer, 31, who has an engineering degree. "We have to focus not just on repairing their systems but getting the Iraqis to do it themselves."  Lindoerfer, who lives in Port Hueneme, Calif., said his unit visited seven Iraqi cities, checking on the condition of five to 10 coalition buildings at each location.  The buildings are gathering places where reconstruction plans are made and local contractors can be chosen and paid for work.  "We made sure the buildings had running water, sewerage, heating and ventilation," he said.  Lindoerfer wound up traveling thousands of miles across the country, sometimes coming under fire.  "We'd have to stop sometimes and wait for ordnance-disposal units to detonate IEDs along the road," he said, referring to improvised explosive devices. "We were very close to several mortar attacks, just missed a firefight in Tikrit, and came under small-arms fire in Baghdad."  Last month, five Seabees from another unit were killed in a mortar attack west of Baghdad.  "There's long way to go for security, but things are moving in the right direction," Lindoerfer said. "The majority of it is from outside insurgents."  Lindoerfer said reporters were missing the good news in Iraq. "It's unfortunate that all we read about are the attacks. There are a lot of people there doing a lot of good."

      This is from an email letter I receive from Dennis Peacocke. He runs an institute called Strategic Christian Services.   By Dennis Peacocke   Sin not only doesn’t work, it makes us all look stupid. Sin hates exposure and, therefore, finds elaborate and often convoluted ways to attempt to defend itself from genuine scrutiny. Sin believes that the best defense is a compelling and sustained offense. No offense appears more powerful than the tactic that calls into question the motives of “those in charge,” playing into whatever in our common fallen nature enjoys being the “victim” and launching the grand inquisition against those in authority. Satan played this trump card in Eden’s garden, so why should we expect anything different from today’s media? Besides, nothing sells better to a sinful audience than an attack on “those in charge,” and the media knows it all too well.  To condemn the fraternity-like hazing of the Iraqi prisons is a no-brainer that makes even amoral people feel good about themselves. In a random test of men I know, many of them experienced similar, though obviously freely-entered-into, indignities when “hazed” by athletic teams or fraternal clubs in their youth. Indeed, in order to join some teenage gangs in America today, the hazing requires the killing of a rival or raping of one of their women. By contrast, the beheading of an American in reprisal scarcely got a day’s news coverage. It died as a story behind a crescendo of self-inflicted outrage that “we probably had it coming for making naked men feel genitally challenged.”  Is what we did in that prison stupid and wrong? Yes. Should we have stayed with “conventional means” to obtain information or control? Do any of you even know what “conventional means” are? Pass the lollipops, please, to those who still believe in “nice wars.”   Living in our own cultural, make-believe world, with our own new universal systemic suicidal urges, concerns me far more than our moral outrages over some macho soldiers’ sadistic urges being vented in a wartime prison. Nobody seems to enjoy a good cultural colonic more than we Americans. The French and Germans, contrary to our protestations, are children in the art of “America bashing” compared to American professors, social critics, and media-room “green light” senior editors.  How could this prisoner abuse have happened? Furrow your brow, buckle up, and I’ll help you see what the real question is. To a nation of culturally intimidated, nominally Christian masses, that apparently sees no problem with fetus-killing, feel-good philosophizing, self-actualizing, separating God and morals from real life and public values, public schools collapsing, postmodern thinking pre-dominating; violence-driven entertainment and music abounding; sexual disease and copulating with anything that moves; bashing Christians while favoring New Age and Islam, the real miracle is that we’re even asking the question!   I love America. The real question is not, “How could it happen?” but rather when will America get real, come off the media dope, and start asking the genuine questions that will help us find true transformation? As the bottom continues to fall out, Mr. Bush is not the primary problem, and neither are the terrorists; we are the problem, and that's...the bottom line.

      Ya know, not that I want to start a big "Oh yeah well what about XYZ" but this stuff is getting easier and easier to find.  Some people soothingly say that one should relax about all this. It's only a movie. No biggie. It's no worse than the tomfoolery of Oliver Stone. It's kick-ass entertainment. It might even help get out "the youth vote." Yeah, well, I have myself written and presented about a dozen low-budget made-for-TV documentaries, on subjects as various as Mother Teresa and Bill Clinton and the Cyprus crisis, and I also helped produce a slightly more polished one on Henry Kissinger that was shown in movie theaters. So I know, thanks, before you tell me, that a documentary must have a "POV" or point of view and that it must also impose a narrative line. But if you leave out absolutely everything that might give your "narrative" a problem and throw in any old rubbish that might support it, and you don't even care that one bit of that rubbish flatly contradicts the next bit, and you give no chance to those who might differ, then you have betrayed your craft.

      During a campaign tour of the Apache Nation Wednesday, Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry said he had a plan to increase every Native American's income by $40,000 a year. Senator Kerry refused Repeated requests for details of his plan. He also told the Apaches that during his Senate career, he has voted "YES" 9,637 times for every Indian issue ever introduced. Before his departure, the Apache Tribe presented the Presidential candidate a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name,  Running Eagle .  After Kerry left, tribal officials explained that Running Eagle is a Bird so full of shit it can't fly.

      There is so much misery out there: Prisoner abuse, corrupt CEO's, Politicians, and the like. We seem to have forgotten who are enemies are, and why we are at war. Why don't we see stories like this one on the front page? Hmmm, I'll give you three guesses...  "The images of 9/11 have faded in the minds of far too many Americans. This picture and this family's riveting story give a stark reminder of why America is at war. Each day around the globe our soldiers are fighting in an attempt to prevent any other event as terrible as the murders that took place on 9/11. Look hard at this picture. See the compassion and sadness on the president's face. Look at this young woman, see her grief and listen her father's words. Ashley and her sister Loren just spent their third Mother's Day without their mother, as did thousands of other children who lost their mothers on 9/11 at the hands of ruthless uncaring terrorists.

      DAY 63:   In an ABC-TV interview in July 2000, Dick Cheney denied participation in any oil- or other business-dealings between Halliburton and Iraq while he was CEO of the company. He admitted to deals with Libya and Iran, but stated that there were strict policies against dealing with Iraq. The Washington Post later revealed that according to UN reports, Halliburton in fact signed contracts worth $73 million with Iraq while Cheney was its CEO. According to the report, two Halliburton subsidiaries sold materials to Baghdad through French affiliates. The sales took place between the first half of 1997 and the summer of 2000. Cheney resigned from Halliburton in August of 2000.   Three weeks after the aforementioned interview, Cheney was informed that a Halliburton spokesman had publicly stated that Dresser Rand and Ingersoll Dresser Pump (the Halliburton subsidiaries) traded with Iraq. Cheney then modified his earlier response, and claimed to be unaware of these dealings. However, the firms continued trading with Iraq for more than a year while Cheney was Halliburton's CEO.   In September '03, Cheney said that since becoming vice president, "I've severed all my ties with (Halliburton), gotten rid of all my financial interest. I have no financial interest in Halliburton of any kind and haven't had, now, for over three years."   To this day he still possesses over 430,000 shares of Halliburton stock options and a deferred compensation account valued at between $500,000 and $1 million.   As Vice President, Cheney continually denies playing any direct role in the government's awarding of multibillion dollar contracts to Halliburton and its subsidiaries, despite internal Pentagon emails indicating that he has.   President Bush has been quoted as saying Cheney's "doing a heck of a good job. When I picked him I knew he was a fine business leader and a fine, experienced man."   (Sources: "Bush defends Cheney over Halliburton" CNN.com, July 17, 2002. See article at: www.cnn.com. "Cheney's Halliburton Ties Remain" CBS News, September 26, 2003. See article at: www.cbsnews.com.

      DAY 58:   The Bush campaign has raised $296.3 million since 1998, giving it the advantage in both the 2000 and 2004 elections. One-third to one-half of this $296.3 million was donated to the Bush campaign by only 631 people.   This is the end result of Bush's "Pioneers" campaign fund. The maximum individual donation to a presidential candidate by law is $1000; however, the Pioneers have been able to work around this regulation by creating a network of people, mostly businessmen, who are each able to persuade 100 friends or more to donate the $1000 maximum to their cause. Donors who have raised at least $100,000 are dubbed "Pioneers". Those who have raised at least $200,000 are called "Rangers".   Of the 246 Pioneers and Rangers in the 2000 campaign, 104 of them have received a job or appointment during Bush's reign in the White House. Twenty-three of them have been made ambassadors.   2000 election Pioneer Kenneth Lay, former Enron chairman, sent the White House a list of eight persons he recommended for appointment to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission upon Bush's election. Two of the persons he recommended were appointed to the five-person commission.   The Pioneers group is now twice as large as it was in the 2000 election.   (Source: Cohen, Sarah, Thomas B. Edsall and James V. Grimaldi. "Pioneers Fill War Chest, Then Capitalize." Washington Post, 16 May 2004)

       Let's begin!  15% of $10,000 is 1,500 dollars. 15% of $100,000 is 15,000 dollars. $15,000 is greater than $1,500  What does this mean?  If you earn 100k and have to pay 15% of your money in taxes you will always pay more than someone who makes 10k.  Now if this was the way our tax system works then no problem...we all pay an equal share, but its not.  Our tax system works on a slide rule.  If you earn more you pay more.   So let's take a look at the way our tax system really "works".  If you earn $10,000 you pay 15% in taxes which is 1,500 dollars. If you earn $100,000 you pay 33% in taxes which is 33,000 dollars. Someone who earns $100,000 earns 10x as much as someone who earns $10,000. Someone who earns $100,000 pays 22x as much taxes as someone who earns $10,000.  You earn more and you are penalized for it.  The person that earned 100k is just much entitled to his/her money as the person who earned 10k.  Why?   Because they earned it!

It will be viewed as a capitulation to the powers-that-be rather than a protest."  So who do you vote for? That quote came from a libertarian. Are they the best protest vote?  urlLink Well, take a look at all the candidates for yourself.  Vote libertarian? Well, I would but my fear is that they would actually win! Some independents argue that a third party vote is nothing but a protest vote; that they know they won't win, they are just bringing the issues they view as important to the forefront of the election. Well, shouldn't a vote for a presidential election be more than just a protest? By voting, you better be damn sure that you would want that person as president, senator, govenor, or high school class secretary (OK, maybe that can just be about popularity). But seriously, would you want  urlLink this party  to have control over our nuclear weapons?  So what do we do? I think there should be a "no vote" vote put onto the ballot.  This would allow the protest vote to actually be counted. More over, what I propose is that if the "no vote" actually received more votes (actual votes not some arbitrary electoral college vote), than another election must be held with all new candidates. The ones that previously ran would be in-eligible to run.  OK so realistically this isn't feasible, but wouldn't it be nice! Politicians might have to start talking about real issues and paying attention to real people instead of the interest groups providing their campaign finances. At least this way you could really know how many people were protesting and how many just didn't give a damn!

      In January 2002, Vice President Cheney refused to let a congressional oversight body see records of his Enron meetings. The records might have helped determine how much influence the company may have had over the energy policy Cheney's task force developed in 2001.   Cheney explained his refusal to publicize what took place at the meetings by saying that he and the president should be allowed to do their work in secret.   He told CNN in 2002:   "I have been in town now off-and-on for 34 years. And during that period of time, there's been a constant, steady erosion of the prerogatives and the power of the Oval Office, a continual encroachment by Congress, War Powers Act, Anti-Impoundment and Budget Control Act, previous instances where presidents have given up, if you will, important principles. So the office is weaker today than it was 30, 35 years ago."  The administration that was in office 30, 35 years ago was the Nixon administration, in which Cheney served. Watergate took place during this same period in Nixon's first term, causing Congress to later establish reforms that made it more difficult for a president to conduct politically motivated burglaries.

       Maybe you’d like to hear about something other than idiot Reservists, naked Iraqis, or general doom and gloom. Maybe you’d like to hear about a real American, somebody who honored the uniform he wears.   Meet Brian Chontosh.  Churchville-Chili Central School class of 1991. Proud graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology. Husband and about-to-be father. First lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps. And a genuine hero. The secretary of the Navy said so yesterday.  At 29 Palms in California Brian Chontosh was presented with the Navy Cross, the second highest award for combat bravery the United States can bestow.  That’s a big deal. But you won’t see it on the network news tonight, and all you read in Brian’s hometown newspaper was two paragraphs of nothing. Instead, it was more blather about some mental defective MPs who acted like animals.  The odd fact about the American media in this war is that it’s not covering the American military. The most plugged-in nation in the world is receiving virtually no true information about what its warriors are doing. Oh, sure, there’s a body count. We know how many Americans have fallen. And we see those same casket pictures day in and day out. And we’re almost on a first-name basis with the pukes who abused the Iraqi prisoners. And we know all about improvised explosive devices and how we lost Fallujah and what Arab public-opinion polls say about us and how the world hates us. We get a non-stop feed of gloom and doom.  But we don’t hear about the heroes. The incredibly brave GIs who honorably do their duty. The ones our grandparents would have carried on their shoulders down Fifth Avenue. The ones we completely ignore. Like Brian Chontosh.  It was a year ago on the march into Baghdad. Brian Chontosh was a platoon leader rolling up Highway 1 in a humvee. When all hell broke loose. Ambush city. The young Marines were being cut to ribbons. Mortars, machine guns, rocket propelled grenades. And the kid out of Churchville was in charge. It was do or die and it was up to him. So he moved to the side of his column, looking for a way to lead his men to safety. As he tried to poke a hole through the Iraqi line his humvee came under direct enemy machine gun fire. It was fish in a barrel and the Marines were the fish.  And Brian Chontosh gave the order to attack. He told his driver to floor the humvee directly at the machine gun emplacement that was firing at them. And he had the guy on top with the .50 cal unload on them. Within moments there were Iraqis slumped across the machine gun and Chontosh was still advancing, ordering his driver now to take the humvee directly into the Iraqi trench that was attacking his Marines. Over into the battlement the humvee went and out the door Brian Chontosh bailed, carrying an M16 and a Beretta and 228 years of Marine Corps pride. And he ran down the trench. With its mortars and riflemen, machineguns and grenadiers. And he killed them all. He fought with the M16 until he was out of ammo. Then he fought with the Beretta until it was out of ammo. Then he picked up a dead man’s AK47 and fought with that until it was out of ammo. Then he picked up another dead man’s AK47 and fought with that until it was out of ammo. At one point h! e even fired a discarded Iraqi RPG into an enemy cluster, sending attackers flying with its grenade explosion. When he was done Brian Chontosh had cleared 200 yards of entrenched Iraqis from his platoon’s flank. He had killed more than 20 and wounded at least as many more.  But that’s probably not how he would tell it. He would probably merely say that his Marines were in trouble, and he got them out of trouble. OOR-Rah, and drive on.  “By his outstanding display of decisive leadership, unlimited courage in the face of heavy enemy fire, and utmost devotion to duty, 1st Lt. Chontosh reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.” That’s what the citation says. And that’s what nobody will hear. That’s what doesn’t seem to be making the evening news. Accounts of American valor are dismissed by the press as propaganda, yet accounts of American difficulties are heralded as objectivity. It makes you wonder if the role of the media is to inform, or to depress - to report or to deride. To tell the truth, or to feed us lies.  But I guess it doesn’t matter. We’re going to turn out all right. As long as men like Brian Chontosh wear our uniform.   (Source: as aired Wednesday, May 12th, 2004 on WNIS AM “Macrini in the Morning”)

We think that he knew he was lying when he made the charges, and we think that they're unsupportable. We intend to bring the truth about that to the American people.  We believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit to be the Commander-in-Chief."   -- John O'Neill, spokesman, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth   "I do not believe John Kerry is fit to be Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the United States. This is not a political issue. It is a matter of his judgment, truthfulness, reliability, loyalty and trust -- all absolute tenets of command. His biography, 'Tour of Duty,' by Douglas Brinkley, is replete with gross exaggerations, distortions of fact, contradictions and slanderous lies. His contempt for the military and authority is evident by even a most casual review of this biography. He arrived in-country with a strong anti-Vietnam War bias and a self-serving determination to build a foundation for his political future. He was aggressive, but vain and prone to impulsive judgment, often with disregard for specific tactical assignments. He was a 'loose cannon.' In an abbreviated tour of four months and 12 days, and with his specious medals secure, Lt.(jg) Kerry bugged out and began his infamous betrayal of all United States forces in the Vietnam War. That included our soldiers, our marines, our sailors, our coast guardsmen, our airmen, and our POWs. His leadership within the so-called Vietnam Veterans Against the War and testimony before Congress in 1971 charging us with unspeakable atrocities remain an undocumented but nevertheless meticulous stain on the men and women who honorably stayed the course. Senator Kerry is not fit for command."   -- Rear Admiral Roy Hoffman, USN (retired), chairman, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth   "During Lt.(jg) Kerry's tour, he was under my command for two or three specific operations, before his rapid exit. Trust, loyalty and judgment are the key, operative words. His turncoat performance in 1971 in his grubby shirt and his medal-tossing escapade, coupled with his slanderous lines in the recent book portraying us that served, including all POWs and MIAs, as murderous war criminals, I believe, will have a lasting effect on all military veterans and their families.  Kerry would be described as devious, self-absorbing, manipulative, disdain for authority, disruptive, but the most common phrase that you'd hear is 'requires constant supervision.'"   -- Captain Charles Plumly, USN (retired)   "Thirty-five years ago, many of us fell silent when we came back to the stain of sewage that Mr. Kerry had thrown on us, and all of our colleagues who served over there. I don't intend to be silent today or ever again. Our young men and women who are serving deserve no less."   -- Andrew Horne   "In my specific, personal experience in both coastal and river patrols over a 12-month period, I never once saw or heard anything remotely resembling the atrocities described by Senator Kerry. If I had, it would have been my obligation to report them in writing to a higher authority, and I would certainly have done that. If Senator Kerry actually witnessed or participated in these atrocities or, as he described them, 'war crimes,' he was obligated to report them. That he did not until later when it suited his political purposes strikes me as opportunism of the worst kind. That he would malign my service and that of his fellow sailors with no regard for the truth makes him totally unqualified to serve as Commander-in-Chief."   -- Jeffrey Wainscott   "I signed that letter because I, too felt a deep sense of betrayal that someone who took the same oath of loyalty as I did as an officer in the United States Navy would abandon his group here (points to group photo) to join this group here (points to VVAW protest photo), and come home and attempt to rally the American public against the effort that this group was so valiantly pursuing.  It is a fact that in the entire Vietnam War we did not lose one major battle. We lost the war at home. and at home, John Kerry was the Field General."   -- Robert Elder   "My daughters and my wife have read portions of the book 'Tour of Duty.' They wanted to know if I took part in the atrocities described. I do not believe the things that are described happened.  Let me give you an example. In Brinkley's book, on pages 170 to 171, about something called the 'Bo De massacre' on November 24th of 1968...In Kerry's description of the engagement, first he claimed there were 17 servicemen that were wounded. Three of us were wounded. I was the first..."   -- Joseph Ponder   "While in Cam Rahn Bay, he trained on several 24-hour indoctrination missions, and one special skimmer operation with my most senior and trusted Lieutenant. The briefing from some members of that crew the morning after revealed that they had not received any enemy fire, and yet Lt.(jg) Kerry informed me of a wound -- he showed me a scratch on his arm and a piece of shrapnel in his hand that appeared to be from one of our own M-79s. It was later reported to me that Lt.(jg) Kerry had fired an M-79, and it had exploded off the adjacent shoreline. I do not recall being advised of any medical treatment, and probably said something like 'Forget it.' He later received a Purple Heart for that scratch, and I have no information as to how or whom.  Lt.(jg) Kerry was allowed to return to the good old USA after 4 months and a few days in-country, and then he proceeded to betray his former shipmates, calling them criminals who were committing atrocities. Today we are here to tell you that just the opposite is true. Our rules of engagement were quite strict, and the officers and men of Swift often did not even return fire when they were under fire if there was a possibility that innocent people -- fishermen, in a lot of cases -- might be hurt or injured. The rules and the good intentions of the men increased the possibility that we might take friendly casualties."   -- Commander Grant Hibbard, USN (retired)   "Lt. Kerry returned home from the war to make some outrageous statements and allegations...of numerous criminal acts in violation of the law of war were cited by Kerry, disparaging those who had fought with honor in that conflict. Had war crimes been committed by US forces in Vietnam? Yes, but such acts were few and far between. Yet Lt. Kerry have numerous speeches and testimony before Congress inappropriately leading his audiences to believe that what was only an anomaly in the conduct of America's fighting men was an epidemic. Furthermore, he suggested that they were being encouraged to violated the law of war by those within the chain of command.  Very specific orders, on file at the Vietnam archives at Texas Tech University, were issued by my father [Admiral Elmo Zumwalt] and others in his chain of command instructing subordinates to act responsibly in preserving the life and property of Vietnamese civilians."   -- Lt. Col. James Zumwalt, USMC (retired)   "We look at Vietnam...after all these years it is still languishing in isolated poverty and helplessness and tyranny. This is John Kerry's legacy. I deeply resent John Kerry's using his Swift boat experience, and his betrayal of those who fought there as a stepping-stone to his political ambitions."   -- Barnard Wolff   "In a whole year that I spent patrolling, I didn't see anything like a war crime, an atrocity, anything like that. Time and again I saw American fighting men put themselves in graver danger trying to avoid collateral damage.  When John Kerry returned to the country, he was sworn in front of Congress. And then he told my family -- my parents, my sister, my brother, my neighbors -- he told everyone I knew and everyone I'd ever know that I and my comrades had committed unspeakable atrocities."   -- David Wallace   "I served with these guys. I went on missions with them, and these men served honorably. Up and down the chain of command there was no acquiescence to atrocities. It was not condoned, it did not happen, and it was not reported to me verbally or in writing by any of these men including Lt.(jg) Kerry.  In 1971, '72, for almost 18 months, he stood before the television audiences and claimed that the 500,000 men and women in Vietnam, and in combat, were all villains -- there were no heroes. In 2004, one hero from the Vietnam War has appeared, running for President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief. It just galls one to think about it."   -- Captain George Elliott, USN (retired)   "During the Vietnam War I was Task Force Commander at An Thoi, and my tour of duty was 13 months, from the end of Tet to the beginning of the Vietnamization of the Navy units.  Now when I went there right after Tet, I was restricted in my movements. I couldn't go much of anyplace because the Vietcong controlled most of the area. When I left, I could go anywhere I wanted, just about. Commerce was booming, the buses were running, trucks were going, the waterways were filled with sampans with goods going to market, but yet in Kerry's biography he says that our operations were a complete failure. He also mentions a formal conference with me, to try to get more air cover and so on. That conference never happened..."   -- Captain Adrian Lonsdale, USCG (retired)   "I was in An Thoi from June of '68 to June of '69, covering the whole period that John Kerry was there. I operated in every river, in every canal, and every off-shore patrol area in the 4th Corps area, from Cambodia all the way around to the Bo De River. I never saw, even heard of all of these so-called atrocities and things that we were supposed to have done.  This is not true. We're not standing for it. We want to set the record straight."   -- William Shumadine   "In 1971, when John Kerry spoke out to America, labeling all Vietnam veterans as thugs and murderers, I was shocked and almost brought to my knees, because even though I had served at the same time and same unit, I had never witnessed or participated in any of the events that the Senator had accused us of. I strongly believe that the statements made by the Senator were not only false and inaccurate, but extremely harmful to the United States' efforts in Southeast Asia and the rest of the world. Tragically, some veterans, scorned by the antiwar movement and their allies, retreated to a life of despair and suicide. Two of my crewmates were among them. For that there is no forgiveness."   -- Richard O'Meara   "My name is Steve Gardner. I served in 1966 and 1967 on my first tour of duty in Vietnam on Swift boats, and I did my second tour in '68 and '69, involved with John Kerry in the last 2 1/2 months of my tour. The John Kerry that I know is not the John Kerry that everybody else is portraying. I served alongside him and behind him, five feet away from him in a gun tub, and watched as he made indecisive moves with our boat, put our boats in jeopardy, put our crews in jeopardy... if a man like that can't handle that 6-man crew boat, how can you expect him to be our Commander-in-Chief?"   -- Steven Gardner   "I served in Vietnam as a boat officer from June of 1968 to July of 1969. My service was three months in Coastal Division 13 out of Cat Lo, and nine months with Coastal Division 11 based in An Thoi. John Kerry was in An Thoi the same time I was. I'm here today to express the anger I have harbored for over 33 years, about being accused with my fellow shipmates of war atrocities.  All I can say is when I leave here today, I'm going down to the Wall to tell my two crew members it's not true, and that they and the other 49 Swiftees who are on the Wall were then and are still now the best."   -- Robert Brant   "I never saw, heard of, or participated in any Swift boat crews killing cattle, poisoning crops, or raping and killing civilians as charged by John Kerry, both in his book and in public statements. Since we both operated at the same time, in the same general area, and on the same missions under the same commanders, it is hard to believe his claims of atrocities and poor planning of Sea Lord missions.  I signed this letter because I feel that he used Swift boat sailors to proclaim his antiwar statements after the war, and now he uses the same Swift boat sailors to support his claims of being a war hero. He cannot have it both ways, and we are here to ask for full disclosure of the proof of his claims."   -- James Steff  Just the way we like it here - straight from the horses mouth. Why weren't these guys up on stage last Thursday at the DNC?

      Senator John Kerry has made his 4-month combat tour in Vietnam the centerpiece of his bid for the Presidency. His campaign jets a handful of veterans around the country, and trots them out at public appearances to sing his praises. John Kerry wants us to believe that these men represent all those he calls his "band of brothers."  But most combat veterans who served with John Kerry in Vietnam see him in a very different light.

       This statue currently stands outside the Iraqi palace,  now home to the 4th Infantry division. It will eventually be shipped home and put in the memorial museum in Fort Hood, Texas.   The statue was created by an Iraqi artist named Kalat, who for years was forced by Saddam Hussein to make the many hundreds of bronze busts of Saddam that dotted Baghdad.   Kalat  was so grateful for the Americans liberation of his country; he melted 3 of the heads of the  fallen Saddam and made the  statue as a memorial to the American soldiers and their fallen warriors.  Kalat worked on this memorial night and day for several months.   To the left of the kneeling soldier is a small Iraqi girl giving the soldier comfort as he mourns the loss of his comrade in arms.
