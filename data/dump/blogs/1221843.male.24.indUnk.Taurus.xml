      So yeah, uh, inclement weather turns me into a good-for-nothing movie junkie.    Also, I had more icey adventures.  This one's a bit better... Nathan, Logan, Jacob Chaney and I went down to the entrance to High Pointe late this afternoon.  On the side of 1382 there is a big wall with a concave trough running along the top of it and then down about a 45 degree angle into a drain.  So we had a de-wheeled skateboard and we were using it as a bobsled, trying to avoid hitting our bottoms on the drain at the end.  That was fun for a while but Nathan dropped the skateboard down the drain and we could see it but we couldn't reach it.  So Jacob and I went further up 1382 to a big drain that we crawled in and began walking down the drain back towards the fallen skateboard underground.  It was pitch black and wet and the only light we had was the screen of Jacob's cell phone.  Also, Logan and Nathan, the pansies who wouldn't go with us, kept talking into the drain about the clown from Stephen King's "IT".  So we finally got there and I had to crawl up into another drainage tunnel that I just fit in and I inch my way up to where the skateboard had fallen.  Fun times.  I felt like I was in the Goonies.  What a silly life I lead...crawling through drainage tunnels to rescue a now worthless skateboard.  Tomorrow, it's back to reality.

      For the third day in a row ice covers all of the roads here in Cedar Hill.  Today I went hiking/skiing in the Dallas Nature Center with my roommate and his cousin and a guy from England named Jonathan.  People from England rule.  Nathan fell through the ice of a little pond on a dare.  Then I ran into my brother and his friends driving through the neighborhood.  I held onto the rearview mirror of the car and was pulled on the ice.  I felt like Marty McFly on Back to the Future.  Then my mom had made soup and grilled cheese.  Greatness.  Not as exciting as Kim's nude Tibetan escapade, but exciting enough for me...

      "But the doing has to grow out of the loving." -Tony Evans  If I would be honest, my love for God is so weak and lacking.  And so often, when I find my relationship with Him struggling is when I am merely doing what I "should" do by reading my bible, or praying, or whatever (insert spiritual discipline).  The love has to be the source of obedience.  And God Himself has to be the source of my love for Him.  Just like the C.S. Lewis story in which a father gives his child sixpence in order for the child to buy him a birthday gift.  I cannot try to love God more.  This is a trap.  One more "should-do".  I must ask Him to do what only He can do and to put it in me.  God, who is love, is the ground of our love for Him.  These are my thoughts...

      Here's your pop culture dose for the week...  Last night I saw Donnie Darko.  Very cool.  Very strange.  I don't want to ruin it for those of you who haven't seen it but if you're in the mood for a "Memento-esque" sci-fi-ish get you thinking movie, this is it.  Any thoughts on it?  Also I bought Faultline "Your Love Means Everything" which rules.  It's got 2 songs with Chris Martin from Coldplay on it.  Oh happiness!

      Okay, okay, I admit, it is a very obscure quote.  But it's my favorite from this movie, even though it is not from a main character.  Here it is one more time, with a hint...  "That's aaa... jellyfish."  Hint: presidents' faces in stone  Good luck my friends.

      Say, ya'll peeped that new 50 Cent yet?  That junk goes hard!  Straight up!  But seriously, on one of my posts a certain word was used, pertaining to risking money in order to gain more money.  This "g" word was turned into a link to some "g"-word-ing site and I did not appreciate it.  I don't know if Blogger does that or some silly head did it to me.  Either way...back up off!   On a nicer note...thank you all soooooooooooooo much for commenting on my blog spot.  I have great friends!  Stay tuned if you want to read a gurnky sci-fi story sooner or later here.  For now, name that movie quote...  "That's aaa... jellyfish."

      Writing about Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, William Barclay says...  "He [Jesus] had to get things straightened out before He started; and had to be alone.  It may well be that we so often go wrong simply because we never try to be alone.  There are certain things which a man [or woman] has got to work out alone..."  For all of you out there that are not involved in a relationship (I hate the term 'single') I just wanted to encourage you to embrace this time.  We don't have to run around trying to find someone.  Sometimes, God lets us be alone for a reason, sometimes for a long while too.  He's out for your best.  Embrace the time you have with just you and God.  Ask Him for the grace to desire and seek Him.  Embrace this moment.  Allow God to mold you and shape you and even tranform you.  Find your identity, and security, and purpose in Him.    Well, that's my thought for the day.

      Okay, Megan, my sister, got me into blog*spot.  This is my first try at setting one up.  Please let me know if something doesn't work or sucks.    Anyways, the other night I watched a movie on IFC called "Hard Eight".  It's about Reno, redemption, and what people will do to save face or protect someone they love.  Very worth it if you have cable and it happens to be on.  Earlier that night, my brother and I listened to an all Coldplay Adventure Club on the radio here (102.2 the edge).  It was a broadcast of the Dallas show and included some other songs, b-sides, imports, etc...  3 hours long, very sweet.  I heard a really cool track from a guy named David Koston? who goes by the name of Faultline.  It was an electronic type song with Chris Martin doing vocals.  Amazing.  Beautiful.  I would like to buy it.    Well, I'll try to be more "insightful" and "personal" in blogs to come.  Until then...

      hi everyone!  i've had a sorry sinus infection this week so i haven't felt up to posting anything of late.  you know what one of the sorriest parts of having a sinus infection is?  you can't taste your food!  in the time i've been sick i went to waffle house AND wingstop (my 2 favorites) and couldn't taste either.  so sad.  ooo...i just had an idea.  wings and waffles.  that would rule.  anyways, i am on the road to recovery and tonight i get to go to houston to see guess who???  drumroll.................................SIGUR ROS!  hip hip hooray!  did anyone see them on "last call?"  okay, i promise i don't normally stay up until 12:30 or whatever to see carson daly, but sigur ros was on!  they had videos playing and it sounded really good.  i'm very happy about tonight.  two bits of trivia about jonsi from sigur ros that i did not know until this week.  1) he is gay, 2) he is blind in one eye.  i found it sort of funny that they made these two things questions on the faq page of their website.  anyways, logan and nathan and myself shall make the drive tonight and return way too early tuesday morning.  pray for our safety if you think about it.  i love all of you.  peace!

      sheesh!  i haven't posted in a long time!  i don't have much to talk about but i could tell you all a little bit of what trailor life is like...  for those of you who don't know, i live in the woods of cedar hill in a trailor on a plot of land that is shared by us and a family in a house.  sound weird?  it gets weirder.  these people have two dogs and the trailor is situated so that our front yard is their back yard, which happens to be inhabited by one of the meanest little mongrels in the world.  her name is oreo, but she is not sweet.  i hate her.  there are few things in life i hate, but oreo would be one of them.  so would bandit.  she is the dog that roams the land.  sorry flea-bag.  okay so these dogs want nothing but my and nathan's death.  as we would love nothing more than their demise.  they do not hesitate to run after us, bite us, and bark incessantly when they see us.  and when any of the radfords (our neighboring family) is outside, it only gets worse.  we become a "threat" to the family and the dogs turn psycho-rabid.    the other day i came outside to get something out of my car and bandit proceeded to growl and bark and come towards me.  this is when i pick up a small rock.  she has learned that rocks are not her friend but she wouldn't shut up or go away so i lightly threw it at her.  it bounced twice and popped her in the nose.  success!  she retreated into the front yard.  maybe she'll think twice now when she sees me pick up a rock.  before you start calling me a dog-hater or running to p.e.t.a. claiming cruelty to animals, come visit my trailor.  see how you like them.  this has been "slices of trailor life."  until next time...

      so, after 33+ hours in a 15-passenger van, i have returned from the "windy city."  i couldn't have asked for a better time.  16 of us stayed with Jesus people usa, which is basically a community of believers that works, lives, serves, worships, plays, etc... together.  they live in an old remodeled hotel called "friendly towers" once known as the "chelsea hotel."  it's hard to explain but everyone shares everything.  money, resources, food, everything is pooled and somehow it all works out fine.  they also operate shelters, half-way homes, daycares, after school programs, rehabs, etc...  this last week we cooked and served food to the homeless, took care of and played with homeless kids, cleaned, painted, dry-walled, moved things, made donation pickups, all kinds of stuff.  it was a blast and the youth really enjoyed everything.  it was a growing and learning experience for everyone.  we also got to do some other stuff like take the "el train" to a switchfoot show at a club called metro.  we ate chicago stuffed pizza at a place called giordano's.  and we got schooled in basketball by some jesus people.  (home court advantage.)  being at jesus people has made me re-evaluate my need for stuff.  everyone there was able to live joyfully and fullfilled yet without much in the "possessions department."  sometimes, our possessions possess us.  detatchment from wealth and possessions is not a law, but a means to freeing up our desires.  that said, here's some richard foster for you...  "If what we have we receive as a gift, and if what we have is to be cared for by God, and if what we have is available to others, then we will possess freedom from anxiety.   This is the inward reality of simplicity.   However, if what we have we believe we have gotten, and if what we have we believe we must hold onto, and if what we have is not available to others, then we will live in anxiety.  Such persons will never knowsimplicity regardless of the outward contrtions they may put themselves through in order to live 'the simple life.' " -richard foster "celebration of discipline"

      hey everyone!  i'm getting ready to go to chicago for the week of spring break with our youth group here at restoration.  keep us in your prayers as we make the long drive.  we'll be working with Jesus people u.s.a.  they're a church that lives in community in inner-city chicago and ministers to their community with shelters, rehabs, after school programs and stuff.  they also do the cornerstone music festival every summer.  and tuesday night...we get to see switchfoot at a chicago club!  i highly encourage you to go out asap and get "the beautiful letdown," their new record.  that said, i thought i would leave a post that everyone to could add to whilst i'm gone.  (if they're brave enough)  i'm asking you for your "guilty listening pleasures".  these would be songs, artists, or cds you enjoy yet are somewhat embarassed of.  for myself, here are a few...  tears for fears ("shout", "head over heels", need i go on...) richard marx (freakin' "hold on to the nights".  you know you love it.) b-52s (except, not "love shack" - i hate that song) ffh (just kidding.  i'd rather be burned at the stake.  well, not really, but ffh makes me want to yak.)

      i tried to post this last night, but it didn't go through for some reason...  i've been thinking a lot lately about my inability to make spiritual progress to occur in my life...any thoughts out there?  while you're thinking, here's a quote for you:  "Take me to You, imprison me, for I Except You enthrall me, never shall be free; Nor chaste, except You ravish me." -John Donne

      "If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.  For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it." -Jesus (Matthew 16:24-25)  "Practical work may be a competitor against abandonment to God, because practical work is based on this argument - 'Remember how useful you are here, or - Think how much value you would be in that particular type of work.'  That attitude does not put Jesus Christ as the Guide as to where we should go, but our judgment as to where we are of most use.  Never consider whether you are of use; but ever consider that you are not your own but His." -Oswald Chambers (My Utmost For His Highest, March 4th)

      wow, 2 pro-shaved comments.  unexpected.  log's happens today and mine is thursday.  if i get it and it looks lame, i will shave it.  i'm anti-spikey.  not that i don't like it or think it looks bad, but simply for the fact that it means you have to put junk in your hair.  i hate putting junk in my hair.  and having to "fix" it.  nuts to that!

      okay so, i'm making up for my lack of posts of late...  the time has come.  i have almost fulfilled the may - may quota along with logan.  we are getting haircuts.  wait, i'm getting misty-eyed.  okay...i'm okay.  the summer months are fast approaching and long hair and june in texas don't mix.  unless you're a girl, cause then you can put it up or put thingies in it or whatever.  with that said, i would love your suggestions, pictures, etc. for how i should get it cut.  please don't say mullet, that's so obvious.  the cut happens on thursday.  my haircut, however, unlike kyle's blog, will not be somewhat democratically elected.  it probably will be, however, this side of mediocre.

      sheesh!  the crowd gets restless!  the reason i have not posted in a long while is because i was only in the office once this week.  and as high-tech as my trailer is, we don't have internet access (gasp).  but you know what they say: excuses are like armpits (or poops), everyone has them and they all stink.  sooooooo...  what's new?  mavs disappointment last night.  i was looking forward to a 4 game sweep.  alas!  oh well, we'll beat them at home.  has anyone seen "a mighty wind?"  the new christopher guest film?  if not, i highly recommend it.  it's about a folk musician reunion and it is quite hilarious.  if you can't see it yet (because cool things are often delayed in getting to lubbock-don't get mad, you know it's true) i suggest renting "waiting for guffman."  you will laugh.  thrift store exploits:  earlier this week i found some cool stuff.  a kids xylophone for 99 cents.  it's missing some notes and mallets or whatever, but it is still cool.  also, i found switchfoot's "new way to be human" for 3 bucks.  you cannot go wrong with that.  it was a happy thrifty day.    also, i just passed the 300 page mark in "fellowship of the ring."  wee!    okay, that's all for now...

      the following is the first of hopefully a weekly installment of some sort of work of fiction about a nineteen year old named Jude.  let me know if you notice any grammatical errors or just think something needs work...                  He climbed the ladder up into the dark, musty attic.  It was pouring outside and he could hear the sound of distant, moaning thunder and sheets of rain falling on the roof.  Jude had only been living with his uncle Ronnie for about a month and discovered the attic above the garage last night.  He had waited until his uncle had gone off to work for the day simply because he felt too awkward asking him if he could check it out.  	Click.  The dust covered light bulb flickered on as Jude pulled the string dangling from it.  It wasn’t big or full of interesting things like Jude had hoped.  It was really only a crawl space with a few boxes, some Christmas lights, an old fish tank, and some bags of clothes.  He crawled on the ply-wood floor and sat down next to three yellowed boxes, lifting the lid off the top one.  	It was full of manila folders and old newspaper clippings.  Jude’s uncle had been a photographer for the paper years and years ago.  Under each picture clipped, he saw the name, Ronnie Holiday.  Each folder was tabbed with a year date and there must have been about thirty folders or so.  Jude couldn’t imagine doing the same thing for thirty years of his life.  Though he admired his uncle and had even started helping him in his dark room down in the basement.  	Setting the box down on his left he reached for the other and set it on his lap, discarding the lid.  This one was full of old family photos, though not neatly organized like the first one.  Jude sifted through the mostly black and white snapshots; many of people he didn’t even recognize.  A ski trip, a family barbeque, some kids in a swimming pool.  He started looking for the color ones to see if he recognized anyone.  There was one of Jude on his uncle Ronnie’s shoulders, eating an orange snow cone.  Jude smiled.   He remembered that day.  It was from the time his uncle had come to Texas to visit.  He and Jude and Jude’s mother had gone to the state fair the morning he flew into town.  Jude sat there wondering about his father.  Wondering what it would have been like if he had known him.  If he hadn’t passed away before Jude was born.  It always gave him this feeling in the pit of his stomach.  A dull, aching, emptiness.  Thunder rumbled from somewhere far away.  Ever since he left Texas, he’d been thinking of his father a lot.    	He sifted through the rest of the colored photos he could find and set them back in the box, messing them around, shuffling them up, as if his uncle was going to come home and find out Jude had been in the attic, not that he would care anyway.  Jude put the lid back on the box in his lap and opened the third one to his right.    	What had once been in the fish tank was in the third box.  A bag of gravel, a piece of fluorescent green coral, a water filter, and some fish food.  Not quite the treasure trove Jude had hoped for when he noticed the attic last night.  He stacked the boxes back on top of one another in the order he found them and crawled towards the ladder.  As he stepped down onto it and reached for the string above him, he noticed a photo lying face down where he’d been sitting.  He reached across the dusty ply-wood and slid it towards him.  Turning it over, he held it under the golden glow of the light bulb above him.  His heart began to race and his stomach turn and he felt within him release and tension at the same time…

(also present: nathan, jon-paul, matt & sally doherty, jason judy, and emily & mrs. harrison)  right up there next to seeing sigur ros or u2 live.  no exageration.  they did good old stuff, good new stuff, just good all around.  "the lighthouse" was their last song before the 1st encore.  they absolutely went off!  and chris thile (manodlin & vocals) started singing the chorus to "yellow" by coldplay!!!!!  i'm serious.  i almost peed my pants with joy.  at the end they completely unplugged and closed with "be thou my vision," a perfect ending.  i think music is one of God's best creations...

      the matrix: reloaded.  i saw it today at 11:30 AM.  of course, i'm sure you'll see it.  i liked it as much as the first one.  i think you have to think of this one not as part 2 but as part one of a 2 part sequel.  the first movie is about answers.  the second is about questions, and lots of them.  i want to go back, there's so much i missed.  i'll wait to discuss it until more of you have seen it.  "choice is the problem."

      this is a tribute to childhood...  shows i really enjoyed as a kid (and still would if they were on):  the muppet show fraggle rock he-man and the masters of the universe ducktales alf the jim henson hour g.i. joe (this one still comes on cartoon network, but there's no cable in the trailer.  or really t.v. at all except for a teeny black and white one that's not good for much except the news, ramble, ramble, ramble...)  feel free to add your own childhood favorites

      i know this looks like a long quote, but i promise, it's worth the read.  it amazes me that a second century monk could be so relevant...  "I have often prayed and asked God for what seemed good in my own estimation.  Like a fool, I kept on at God to grant me this; I would not leave it to him to arrange as he knows best for me.  Then, having obtained the thing I had prayed for so stubbornly, I have often been sorry that I did not leave it to the will of God, for the reality often turned out very different from the way I imagined...Do not pray for your heart's desires, for they may not entirely harmonize with God's purposes.  Pray instead as you have been taught: 'May your will be done in me.'  Pray to God this way about everything, that his will might be accomplished in you, for he only desires what is good and useful for your life, whereas you do not always request this." -Evagrios of Pontus

      the mavs lost last night.  bummer.  that puts the series at 2 and 2 headed back to dallas.  my favorite maverick has become nick van excel.  though he didn't do much last night, he has kept the mavs in this series.  we lovingly refer to him as, "The Turtle," "The Goldfish," or "The Prophet."    also, last night before the game we played some hoop at high pointe church, 3 on 3 style.  it was a blast, and i actually played well.  setting picks, cutting to the basket with lay-ups, making shots.  i surprised myself.  nathan had the hot hand too, i think he hit like 3 perimeter shots.  it was good times.  here's something from the psalms i read this morning... "When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have ordained; what is man that You take thought of him, and the son of man that You care for him?  Yet You have made him a little lower than God, and You crown him with glory and majesty!" -psalm 8:4-5

      yay mavs!  i admit, i was really angry at them but they pulled through sunday.  i'm betting on a 2-4 mavs loss in the series with sacramento.  final, sac vs. san an.    last night the henry males and the pettijohn males went and saw x-men 2.  happy happy, joy joy.  it was better than the first one, i guarantee!  but also, i was a huge comic book dork back in the day, so i'm somewhat biased.  my posts as of late have been lacking in the humor/insight factors.  sorry.  wait, no, i'm not sorry.  what you see is what you get.  there.

      the deed is done.  at 5:00 p.m., central standard time, i got my hair cut.  i can't post pictures, cause I don't want to pay the fee for blogger pro, but it's along the lines of cameron frye on "ferris bueller's day off" only a bit longer.  it feels nice but i look 4 years younger and so, must grow what facial hair i can.  that said...  i got a weird email yesterday.  someone from jesus people usa, who does the cornerstone music fest asked if i would be willing to help out in a thursday seminar on blogging.  what?!?!  i'm not very educated in the ways of the blog, though, i would consider myself a fairly avid bloger.  but also, i don't think i have met this person and i don't know how she knows i blog.  strange, but it could be exciting.  in other news, thursday, may 15th will rock.  i will see the matrix: reloaded AND pedro the lion on tour with ester drang in ft. worth that night.  yes!  yes!  yes!  if may 15th had been my birthday it would have been much more exciting.

The traditional and typical of Chinese glorious history and cultual."  isn't that great?

      okay, so jude is back...  in other news, i signed up for a short photography & dark room class which starts next month and ends in august.  it's at a place called dallas darkroom and there are 5 (3 hour classes) on tuesday nights and one field trip.  plus 10 extra dark room hours.  i'll have to miss one class though because of youth camp.  maybe i can use my hopefully newly acquired skills there.  has anyone heard any really good praise/worship songs lately?  i'm always on the lookout for restoration and now trying to stay away from "passion" stuff for a while.  (not that it's bad, just done a lot.)  also, i finally watched some homestar runner today.  pretty funny.

      "jude" continues...  about a month and 3 weeks ago...  The sun was going down fast on the small town somewhere in Idaho.  It was the time of day when everything is golden.  When everything seems to look so much more beautiful than it otherwise might appear.  A field that was merely a field at noon, now looks Elysium.  Worn down buildings erected in the fifties find their glory restored to them.  Heaven touches down and everything is bathed in its glow.  And then the sun is gone, and night falls, and all remains hidden until the light breaks forth again, beginning the next day as the last one ended, in a cleansing bath of quiet, fiery streaks of sun…  Jude stood next to his old beat-up Chevy pickup. It had just broken down and he stood with his hands on his waist, looking down on the town from a hill several miles away.  Smoke rose up from the propped-open hood of the truck and whipped and curled around in the quiet shifting wind.    He snatched a Polaroid camera from the cab, walked down the shoulder away from the truck, and aimed it at the town.  Click.  Like a fortune-telling machine at a carnival, the camera produced a white square. Jude pulled it out and fanned in the air, looking out over the scene he had just captured.  The tiny buildings and streets wrapped in gold began to materialize in the photograph and Jude walked back to the truck.  It wasn’t starting last night at a truck stop so he had stayed the night in the cab hoping for a better tomorrow.  And fortunately it started but now he found himself in a worse predicament.  It had died on him as he was driving down the hill and would only concede a clicking noise at the turn of the key.  Worse, Jude didn’t know a thing about cars or engines or anything like that.  So he stood there prodding at parts, even though he had no idea what they did.  Breaking down didn’t concern Jude; it was what it would cost that worried him.  That aside, he saw this trip as an adventure anyways.  He was traveling from Texas to Portland, Oregon to move in with his uncle and go to school there.  His mother had finally married a man who wasn’t Jude’s father and he found it too strange to stay and much more exciting to move to Oregon.    So there he was.  With no idea of what was wrong with his truck or even if there would be a place to fix it there.  The way it was all set on fire by the glow of the sun made the town very inviting though, thought Jude.  So he slammed the hood shut and reached into the cab for his backpack and a couple of other things and locking the door, more out of habit than need, he began to walk towards the town on the shoulder of the road.  The gravel crunched under Jude’s shoes as he made his way down the curves of the hill.  Jude was a fairly tall, thin 19-year old.  His dark black hair fell down over his green eyes and he was always brushing it aside so he could see.  He wore a pair of old frayed jeans and a maroon, pocketed t-shirt.  As he walked, a white Camaro was coming down the hill, far behind him, and to the driver, Jude was only a silhouette.  The Camaro slowly approached the silhouette, pulling to the shoulder of the road, and Jude turned, hearing the hum of a motor in his ear.  The car came to a stop next to him and Jude bent down looking into the open passenger side window.

      hi friends.  sorry for the tardiness of my posting as of late.  i have been in a bit of a lazy funk and hope this monday i find my way out of it.  a few things...i will be in the office tomorrow so i can post more "jude."  if you've ever seen  pulp fiction , that's kind of the idea on the beginning of this story.  we'll now go back in time to way before this event and eventually find ourselves where we started as the story progresses.  also, i found out my eisley  laughing city  ep review is slated for june 24th.  so that will be on the relevant magazine website.  yay.  okay, i'll return tomorrow...

"jude" will be back up after the weekend.  i forgot i was going to be out all week.  okay, well...i gotta go eat dinner with my mom and dad.  later days...

      I'm not one to go on a political rant, because I'm not really informed well enough to do that, but I thought I'd put this out there and see what anyone thinks.  -Some military divisions have been in the Middle East before the war, through it, and are still there.  One division has been told they would be home in May, then June, then late July, then Rumsfeld I think said August.  Now they're being told sometime after September.  What the?!?!  What are we to expect from a military that is lied to repeatedly.  Whose hopes are continually put through the wringer?   -Rumsfeld has also said that there was nothing like guerilla warfare going on in Iraq, but leading military officials are saying otherwise.  -Where the blazes are the Weapons of Mass Destruction?  Wasn't this the reason given to the American public and the U.N. for going to war in the first place?  I know probably everyone will hate me for questioning the Bush administration, and I don't know whose fault this stuff is or if it's all just bad information.  But I think it's worth considering.    If you want more specific info, I recommend the Drudge Report.  I have it linked.  Later days...

      okay, i've kept all two of you in suspense long enough.  i give you...   Bizarro's Death and the Mighty Wind That Almost Thwarted Our Efforts to Destroy Him  It was the last night of Cornerstone.  After showering in sulfur water, I made my way back to camp, which I could easily see from the dusty main road.  Past a line of tents, (Encore 1 & 2 and Impromptu) our campsite lay about 100 yards away.  Everyone began to trickle back and talk turned to killing Bizarro.  Bizarro was a puppet I had made early in the week to keep from going insane or melting in the heat of the day.  Actually, that's not true, I made him one night when I was bored and had lots of blue tape.  Anyways, he had a head made of a cut-up water bottle with a little trap-door mouth (kinda like Beaker from the Muppets), a Pop Tarts box body, and some tiny rope arms.  In the glow of the citronella candle, he bacame quite a frightening sight.    Well, Bizarro had served his purpose throughout the week in keeping us entertained and we had all agreed that on the last night, he would go down in a blaze of glory.  So, let me set the scene...Dusty main road, a line of three stage tents along it, then about 100 yards from the road throught the tents was our campsite.  Loud heavy metal coming from one of the tents, perfect music for destructive acts.    We staked Bizarro down with a tent peg a good 20 feet from our tents and canopy cover.  Guy, being the pyro of the bunch loaded Bizarro with sparklers and all manner of firecrackers as Jacob videoed the progress.  And then, for reasons unknown we all looked up.  Every one of us.  100 yards away, billowing up over the 3 stage tents was a white, dust-filled wind that looked like a tidal wave cresting over the tops of the tents.  We all stared in awe.  "It's the Apocalypse!"  I yelled.  And the gale rushed at us faster and mightier than a train.  We all stumbled at the impact of it.  It took our staked-down canopy cover and hurled it no less than  50 feet away into other peoples' camp sites.  One of the small tents flipped over and I grabbed on to it to keep it from doing the same.    The strength of it only lasted no more than 10 seconds and we all, in a frenzy, reasoned that Bizarro was trying to thwart his death.  "Kill him!"  We screamed madly.  "Kill him!"  So we ran to see if he was still there.  Yes!  Guy began to douse him with lighter fluid as Jacob documented everything on video tape.  Heavy metal music raging in the distance, Bizarro turned into a pyre of flame and smoke, finally burning down to nothing.  And there was great rejoicing that night at the demise of Bizarro.  The End.

      well...here's what's been happening lately.  last night we watched a movie called "monsoon wedding."  it took me a while to get into it but once it got going i really enjoyed it.  then tawd and i went to sitwell's a coffee spot and then to a club called jacob's where they had 80s night.  it was pretty crazy, i enjoyed it though.  today we did household chores and yardwork.  mostly i worked with kenny...sweeping, swiffering, and weeding.  we just got back from an instore performance of over the rhine at a book store here.  bueno.  tonight i'm going to go with dave and hear him speak at a retreat.  should be cool.  it's my last full day here.  *sigh*  okay, that's all for now...later days.

      hi all.  i'm doing well here in cincinatti.  last night we had a cookout here and i got to meet some cool people.  one of them is owen brocke.  he's part of a house church here and he and some others from the vinyard central network went on a 'round the globe missions type trip a couple years ago.  so it was neat to hear about that and to hear his heart for it.    also last night, over the rhine stopped by the community house to say hi.  so cool.  linford played some piano and that was real cool.  this guy here kenny keeps telling me it's not normally like this...with over the rhine stopping by, cookouts, free cd release parties, etc.  i guess it's a good week to be here.    cat and i got to kid-sit for a couple hours today.  zoe and izaac...their parents are heads of another household here on the grounds.  super nice people, really cute kids.    well, tonight is house church here @ community house.  i'm looking forward to seeing what it's like.  okay i'm out for now.  later days...

      this morning we had breakfast and prayers together.  then we put together some ikea furniture.  we put together a bed which i will sleep on tonight.  it's nice.  all of this before 10 am.  i'm used to starting my day around then.  it feels good to go to bed early, wake up early, and accomplish things.  speaking of waking up, dave wanted me to read a couple of chapters in a few books and one of them is called "In the Spirit of Happiness: The Monks of New Skete."  i found this quote which i thought would fit well in my blog...  "At last the Seeker replied, 'I've learned that the whole world's asleep - myself included.'  Father raised his eyebrows and rubbed his bearded chin...finally he offered his own thoughts.  'It's the same for all of us.  The real question is how serious are you about waking up.'"

      sick.  i'm sitting here on the internet at my parents' house and the little opening to the attic shifts out of place and starts bowing like some animal or serial killer is trying to get out.  logan grabs a louisville slugger and my mom says there's like a straight-line wind outside or something.  i get closer with the bat and realize that a really strong wind has blown through the attic shifting the opening out of place.  relieved that an alien isn't going to jump down on me and eat my face off, i prop it back in place with the bat and return (a bit shaken) to the computer.  other stuff... i just watched episode 3 and 4 of  band of brothers  last night.  so then i went to the library today to find some free stuff about ww 2.  i checked out the book  the moon is down  by john steinbeck.  i'm more than halfway through it cause it's pretty short, but it's really good.  and super cool.  steinbeck was involved in some govt. organizations that were precursors to the cia.  he was commissioned to write a work of anti-nazi germany propaganda fiction.  so this is it.  it was printed on all these clandestine presses in nazi-occupied denmark, france, norway, etc... and served as encouragement to lots of anti-nazi resistance movements throughout europe.  if you're interested in ww ii stuff, it's a good, short read.  also, i just watched  amelie  this weekend.  so great, so brilliant, so hilarious.  if you haven't seen it.  i highly recommend it.  though there are a couple scenes you might be uncomfortable watching with your parents.  it's comedic though.  if you liked  tenenbaums  i think you'd like this a lot.  okay, well...that's all for now.  later days...

      hi friends.  i just got back from chili's with friends after midpointe.  grand times.  i think we're going to go play a huge game of "mafia" over at cat's house.  it should be rad.    i played bass with nathan and jon-paul this weekend at a show at his church.  that was fun too.  we did like 6 songs and then we went and ate ate this good pizza/pasta/sports bar called boston's.    it finally rained here.  boy did we need it.  it was starting to get really dry.  and nathan's car didn't look black anymore.  we got up to 109 this week i think!  too hot.  come fall, come.

      without further delay, here's more of the "Jude Saga," don't worry, i promise it won't turn into a sappy love-story that makes us all feel lonely and sad.  oh yeah, i posted before this too about the new blog title, let me know what you think...  As he walked, a white Camaro was coming down the hill, far behind him, and to the driver, Jude was only a silhouette.  The Camaro slowly approached the silhouette, pulling to the shoulder of the road, and Jude turned, hearing the hum of a motor in his ear.  The car came to a stop next to him and Jude bent down looking into the open passenger side window.    “Hey!” said the girl behind the steering wheel, “Is that your truck back there?”    “Yeah.”  “Do you want a ride into town then?”  “Um, yeah, thanks,” said Jude as he opened the door, taking off his backpack and sliding into the passenger seat.  “Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.”  “Sure no problem, I’m headed back into town anyways, had to get out of the house for a while.  I’m Mary,” said the girl, reaching out her hand.  “I’m Jude,” he replied shaking Mary’s hand.  Mary had long, brown hair tied in a pony-tail and bright blue eyes.  She was wearing a green t-shirt, jeans and flip-flops.  She smiled before turning back to the road.  What a smile, Jude thought.    “So what’s the story?  Road trip?  Running away from home?  Going to visit family?”  “Yeah,” Jude said as he laughed.  “All three pretty much.  My mom just got married, which is cool, but the guy’s not my dad so it’s kind of weird.  Anyways, so I’m on my way to Portland to live with my uncle and start going to school there.”  “Wow, that’s cool, where are you from then?”  “Texas.”  “Oh wow!  What a trip…  Well, there’s a fix-it place in town but it won’t be open ‘til tomorrow morning.”  “Yeah, I figured.  I’ll probably just get some food and head back to the truck for tonight.”  “Oh no way!  You can stay with my friend Mark.  Actually I’m headed to the restaurant we work at to help him close up for the night, so you could get some food too.”   “That’s cool but I don’t want to impose on a guy I don’t know because of a girl I just met…”  “Seriously, Mark won’t care at all.  His parents are really cool.  Like the nicest people in the whole town.”  “Cool, well, uh, thanks.”  “Sure.  I’ll mention it to him, he won’t mind at all.  It’s this place right up here on the corner, where we work I mean.”  Jude had been watching the streetlights go by and was wondering what Mark was like, or if Mark was Mary’s boyfriend, or what, and then, there they were.  The white Camaro pulled into a broken-up blacktop parking lot in front of a small fluorescent-lit burger place, with big windows.  It was painted red and white with a sign above the door – Kelly’s – it read.  “This is Kelly’s.  It’s like the mom and pops burger place in town.”  “Sounds good,” said Jude, feeling the emptiness in his stomach.  They got out of the car and walked towards the front door.  Jude saw someone behind the counter in a red apron.  Must be Mark, he thought.  He reached for the door and the bells hanging on the other side of it jangled as he opened it for Mary.  “Thanks,” she said, in a surprised voice, as though not many people opened doors for her.

      what do you few who read this think of "awake, SLEEPER" for a new blog title?  "this WAKING LIFE," is taken from the movie by richard linklater and i liked it because it's this idea of constantly waking up to reality, to life.  but i don't want to be too obviously like the movie title so anyways, "awake, SLEEPER" or "this WAKING LIFE" with "Awake, sleeper..." as the tag line?  does anyone really care?

      i shaved off my 'stache (sick, note to self, never say "stache" again) so now i look like abraham lincoln.  in other news i was in the west end tonight, with my photography class and when i went to my car in the parking lot at about 8:30 or 9 some guy jumped out and mugged me.  just kidding, i had a flat tire.  changed it all by myself and went and got it fixed once i got back to cedar hill.  not fun, but it could've been worse.  that is all for now.  later days...

      well, it looks as though soon nathan and i will be abandoning the trailer.  *sniff*  no more evil barking dogs, no more standing water in the shower, no more daddy long legs greeting me in the bathroom in the morning.  oh trailer, you shall be missed.  we'll be moving into a sweet 3 bedroom apartment with my brother logan and our crazy friend chris jones.  jones is the man.  we'll have pools, free high speed internet/computer room, excersise room (like i'll ever use it), free alarm system on the apartment, and we'll be neighbors with sean (rcc's youth minister) and his wife julie.  so that's cool.  i played golf tonight with my dad and a family from church.  it's a crappy 3 par course but it was lots of fun and i actually got a few pars.  that one semester of golf at u.t.a. paid off i guess.   well, another week comes to a close.  and my "beard" looks the same as it did last week.  later days friends...

      in light of my blatant hypocrisy, here is a new post.  kimberly j. johnson, i hunbly beg you forgiveness for trying to take the speck out of my sister's eye when there was a log in my own...  i bought a radiohead ticket for the woodlands concert on october 1st.  the only other band i want to see before i die is now coldplay.  in light of concets that rule, here are some of the best live performances i have seen...  sigur ros - houston (verizon theater) U2 - dallas (reunion arena) questions in dialect - cornerstone strongarm - cornerstone nickel creek - dallas (gypsy tea ballroom) unwed sailor - cornerstone pedro the lion - ft. worth and denton (ridglea & rubber gloves) stretch armstrong - cornerstone zao - cornerstone  i don't have much to post about...oh here's one last thing.  we got a new computer in the church office because the last one was a vile wicked creature out to steal our souls and kill us mercilessly with pop-ups and various technical errors.  anyways, next week we're going to take it out to a field with a baseball bat and a boom box and do it 'office space style.'  dang, it feels good to be a gansta...

      why am i still awake?!?!  have you ever experienced something, like a really good book or song and been like, "why do i even try?  i will never be able to do something as great as that."  i'm reading  henry's list of wrongs  and it inspired me to work on  jude  some more tonight.  and then i get to working and i'm like, "this is so lame..."  anyways, I know it's not about comparison.  and we all need something to aspire too.  i just feel so far behind.  they say practice makes perfect though, right?  or, practice makes better anyways.  writing fiction is a hard discipline.    some of us saw  cabin fever  tonight.  at first it seemed scary, but then it just got darkly and disturbingly hilarious.  nathan said it seemed like the guys were sitting around, working on a serious horror/thriller script and got bored about halfway through it.  like, "this sucks.  let's just take it over the top."  and boy they sure did.  it wasn't "scary movie" funny though.  it was dark and disturbing funny.  i wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but i was glad it didn't end up being all pretentiously serious or something.    maybe i should go to bed...

      well, it's official.  october 18th will be my last day at restoration and i will be moving to join  community house  in cincinnati, ohio the following week!  i will miss all at restoration but i'm super excited about this new opportunity.  it's a 6 month to 2 year stay, depending on how long i decide to do it.  then...who knows.  maybe i'll come back to texas, maybe i'll stay there, maybe i'll become a rock star.  okay probably not that last one.  anyways, we shall see.  here's something completely weird.  my right eyelid has been twitching every now and then for like, the last week.  i can't stand it!  i'm not sure what's going on, but hopefully it'll stop.  logan and i went thrift store shopping today.  he got 3 shirts, i got nothing.  i wanted to find a corduroy sport jacket, but my arms are disproportionately long in comparison to my torso, so i couldn't find one that wasn't either too long in the body or too short in the arms.  i am a freak.

      well, i sold some cds and got  weezer: the blue album ,  miles davis: kind of blue , and $6 cash.  not bad.  i was really hoping to find some flaming lips though.  nathan found  the album leaf !  used!  what?!  someone is crazy out there.    i finished  the catcher in the rye  today.  sheer goodness.  i want to buy a copy and read it again.  i just can't even say how much i now love this book.  if you haven't yet, read it.  i just started a new one.  my dallas public library card is my new best friend.  now i'm reading   henry's list of wrongs   by john scott shepherd.  very good so far.  even sort of salinger-ish.  i also checked out  the bell jar  when i returned my other books.  so that's next on the to-read list.  i am such a dork.  i can't decide on tomorrow night.  men's discussion group, i-55 (this college bible study thing @ nate's church), or  the theater fire  at the gypsy tea room for $6.  you can't beat that price for a good show.  then again, if i can find some flaming lips online for cheap, i may buy that instead of a concert.  anyways, i've got no one to go to the show with.  that could be depressing.  all this reading has sort of inspired me and i'm going to try and get some more  jude  written.  i should give myself deadlines so i actually accomplish things.  i read j.d. salinger worked on and off for 10 years on  the catcher in the rye  though.  so that's some consolation.  think if you could write books for a living.  that'd be great.  travel in your spare time.  write  while  you travel.  i think it would be nice.

       the catcher in the rye  freaking rules.  i am laughing my head off reading it.  laughing out loud!  i don't know why i never finished it in high school, it's great.     what i've consumed today...  2 bowls of frosted fruities (albertson's knock-off) 1 turkey and cheese sandwich lays monterey jack chips lipton terriyaki noodles 1 otis spunkmeyer banana nut muffin 2 dr. peppers 1 sam's choice cola  it rained a lot today.  a lot.  like 3.25 inches or something.  troy dungan said "cedar hill" on the news tonight cause we had so much rain.    i picked up my dad from the airport.  he had a late flight coming in from glorieta, new mexico.  he ate at bobcat bite today.  that place rules.  arguably the best burgers in the whole world.  real big, with green chiles and white cheddar on them.  mmmmm.

      hey everybody.  i just got back from waco.  why, you ask?  well for the david crowder cd release party, i say.  $15 got me a concert, the new cd - "illuminate", the "yellow cd" - a 4 song special disc, and a handful of stickers.  not bad i say.  i haven't listened to the whole cd intently yet, but i really enjoyed the concert.  they basically played through the playlist of the cd.  i'm sure you'll all be enjoying it in some form or fashion sooner or later.  anyways, that's all.  oh yeah, and i'm really really sore from football yesterday.

      certain songs, or albums often take me to a different place in my memory.  the place where i first really listened to them.  so, this is a list i call  sounds like where ...i will list the album(s) or artist(s) and then the place or experience it reminds me of - chronologically.  ready, go...   the prayer chain: mercury  - family trips to new mexico   five iron frenzy: our newest album ever!  - family trip to utah, grand tetons, yellowstone...   u2: war  - first major road trip with my friend rachel bolin to lubbock to visit matt doherty and ronni creech at texas tech university   over the rhine: good dog bad dog  - 3 week road trip with robert hawkins to new england    andrew peterson: carried away  and  100 portraits: five wise virgins  - everyone's festival (the good one)   city on a hill: sing alleluia   - solo trip to glorieta new mexico   sigur ros: ( )  - family new years trip to new york city  well, now that i've actually done it, i've realized i really associate music with trips, not so much places.  so i have re-named my list to  sounds like travel .  the end.

      Al Qaeda and the Kingdom of God  The other day I read an article which said that an Al Qaeda spokesperson had come forward saying that Americans should expect more attacks; in fact, an attack so horrendous, it would make us forget about 9/11.  Let me just get honest.  Anger flooded me.  I cursed Al Qaeda over and over in my head and heart.  F#&% them!”  I thought to myself.    Then I remembered our Lord’s words, “Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.”  What?!?!  How am I, a broken, angry, sinful person supposed to do that? Loving the people of Al Qaeda feels downright impossible.  But if I am to be obedient to Jesus, who prayed, “Father forgive them…” for His enemies, I must.  A friend of mine pointed out that it soon becomes impossible to hate someone whom you are constantly praying for.  Love is the fruit of God injecting His forgiveness and mercy into us.  I cannot love fundamentalist terrorists on my own; but God can, and if I will pray for them and seek Him, by His grace I will be enabled and empowered to love my enemies.  The solution is not to nuke some country or some political hotspot.  The solution is not to hunt down and slit the throats of all terrorists everywhere.  As long as we live in a fallen world, there will always be terrorists, there will always be wars, and there will always be sin.  The real battle is not the “War On Terror.”  The real battle is the battle for the kingdom of God.    In Dallas Willard’s book, The Divine Conspiracy, he comments on the kingdom:  “Now God’s own ‘kingdom’ or ‘rule,’ is the range of his effective will, where what he wants done is done.  The person of God himself and the action of his will are the organizing principles of his kingdom, but everything that obeys those principles…is within his kingdom…So when Jesus directs us to pray, ‘Thy kingdom come,’ he does not mean we should pray for it to come into existence.  Rather, we pray for it to take over at all points in the personal, social, and political order where it is now excluded: ‘On earth as it is in heaven.’”  Our limited point of view, based on our experiential (yet finite) knowledge of time, history, existence, society, and God cannot perceive with absolute clarity the rightness, justness, and goodness of God in the face of events like 9/11.  Let me show you what I mean.  Solomon, the wisest man to ever live bemoaned the futility of life in Ecclesiastes.  “There is futility which is done on the earth, that is, there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked.  On the other hand, there are evil men to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous.  I say that this too is futility…  It is the same for all.  There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked…  This is an evil that is done under the sun, that there is one fate for all men.  Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives.  Afterwards they go to the dead.”  - Ecclesiastes 8:14, 9:2, 3      Solomon perceived that life can be a very frustrating, confusing, and seemingly futile experience.  Certainly, if life “under the sun” is all there is to life, it does seem to be a cosmic joke; an ironic, meaningless little blip on the screen of the history of the universe.  But though we may live in a broken and fallen world full of broken and fallen people, and though life “under the sun” may be unfair and unjust, God’s kingdom is stealthily infiltrating the lives and habitats of those who will seek Him.    What we see on the news will most likely not aid us in realizing this.  Believing that there is a good and just God on the throne and that He is even now establishing His rule amongst us requires faith – “the assurance of things hoped for.”  By faith we believe that God is not powerless or heartless or aloof, but a “Rewarder of those who seek Him…abundant in loving-kindness to all who call on Him…good to those who wait for Him, to the person who seeks Him.”  Its true King will one day flip this crazy, war-ridden world on its head.  The lion will lie down with the lamb, Israelis will embrace Arabs, terror will be no more, and peace will reign forever.    But until that day, this is our battle: the battle for the kingdom.  If I want peace and justice in this world, I start with myself, by submitting to God’s rule in my own life, my own struggles.  I allow Him to conquer my anger and fear.  I allow His kingdom to invade my life, my heart.  I begin to pray for my enemies.  I begin to love them.  And slowly but surely, God answers my prayer, “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done.  On earth as it is in heaven.”

      Jude had been watching the streetlights go by and was wondering what Mark was like, or if Mark was Mary’s boyfriend, or what, and then, there they were.  The white Camaro pulled into a broken-up blacktop parking lot in front of a small fluorescent-lit burger place, with big windows.  It was painted red and white with a sign above the door – Kelly’s – it read.  “This is Kelly’s.  It’s like the mom and pops burger place in town.” “Sounds good,” said Jude, feeling the emptiness in his stomach.  They got out of the car and walked towards the front door.  Jude saw someone behind the counter in a red apron.  Must be Mark, he thought.  He reached for the door and the bells hanging on the other side of it jangled as he opened it for Mary.  “Thanks,” she said, in a surprised voice, as though not many people opened doors for her.  “Hey Mark.” “What’s up.” “This is Jude, his truck broke down just outside of town and he’s on his way to Portland.” “Oh man, I’m sorry,” said Mark with genuine compassion.  He reached out his hand to shake Jude’s and Jude returned the shake.   “I saw it coming, it did this to me last night too,” said Jude. “That sucks.”  “Yeah,” said Jude as he reached his hand up and started messing with his hair.  He did that when he was nervous or uncomfortable, and Jude was always overly self-conscious in the presence of more than one new person.  “Hey Mark,” said Mary, “I was telling Jude he could probably stay with you.  Like crash on your couch or something?” “Sure, no problem.” “Are you sure?” Jude interrupted, “Cause I don’t want to be a hassle, I mean, I can just roll out my sleeping bag in the truck bed, or whatever.”  Something else Jude habitually did, used the phrase, “…or whatever.”   “No way man.  You’re welcome to my couch as long as you need it.” “Wow.  Okay, thanks a lot,” said Jude gratefully.  “See?  Told you he wouldn’t mind,” said Mary with that smile again.  “You want some food?  On the house?” “Sure, thanks.” “I got it,” said Mark.  “You wanna get the tables for me Mary?  I’ll hit the kitchen; the mopping and bathrooms are all done.” “K,” said Mary, reaching around the counter for a washcloth and a bucket full of bleach-water.  “You can take a seat Jude, Mark’ll have some food out in a sec.”  “I feel bad,” said Jude watching Mary wiping down tables.  “At least let me help you clean the tables, earn my keep around here.”  “Okay,” Mary said laughing.  “Here,” and she underhanded a damp washcloth across the restaurant at Jude.  He caught it and began wiping the salt and crumbs and soft drink stains off the tables and rearranging the napkin dispensers and salt-and-pepper shakers.  Jude heard Mark’s voice from somewhere back in the kitchen, “You want cheese on your burger Jude?”  “Um, yeah sure, thanks,” Jude called back.  “I’ve heard Portland’s really pretty,” said Mary, as she looked up from the shine of a clean, wet table. “Yeah, the last time I was there was when I was like seven or eight or something, so I don’t remember much, just that everything was really green, and it rained like the whole time.” “I wish I could get out of here.  I graduated a year ago and I feel like the only loser who hasn’t moved on with life.  Still working at Kelly’s, cleaning tables.” “I wouldn’t feel so bad, it’s been a year for me too and I’m just now leaving.  Probably won’t even be able to start classes for another year or so, just so I can save up enough money.”  Mary moved to another table.  “Yeah money’s my problem too.  My mom wants to help me but my step-dad…”  And her eyes glazed over as she looked down at her reflection on the shiny table top.  “Sorry,” she said, wiping her eyes and laughing out of embarrassment.  Jude didn’t know how to respond.  He felt like he wanted to show his concern but he didn’t know how.  Jude wasn’t very good at showing the way he felt, unless he was depressed, he wore that like a badge.   “He’s been a jerk tonight.  That’s why I was out driving when I saw you.  Guess there’s a reason for everything huh?” she said as she looked up from the table.  “Yeah, I guess so,” said Jude, reluctantly, not believing it himself.  Though Mary’s smile made a convincing case.  “So, what’s there to do around here?” Jude asked, changing the subject before it turned on him.  “Well, there’s the lake, there’s a one-screen movie theater in old downtown, aaaand,” she looked up at the ceiling, “that’s about it,” she said, shrugging her shoulders.    “Weren’t you going fishing tomorrow afternoon Mark?” Mary yelled over her shoulder.  “Yeah,” said Mark, a lot closer than Mary had thought.  They all three laughed.  “You’re more than welcome to come if you want,” he said to Jude, setting down a cheeseburger and fries basket on the table he’d been wiping down.  “I mean, if you have to wait on your truck or anything.”  “Okay, cool,” Jude said looking down at his food.  “Hey thanks again Mark.”  “No problem.” Mark headed back into the kitchen.

      the following poem was based on the first line...i liked the phrase so a poem followed.  cameras keep us rectangles of personal history that blur the lines between what is memory and what is simply documentation? yellow t-shirts ewok villages sweaty hair was this me? is this me? my memory betrays me am i remembering the event itself? or am i remembering this little thing?  also, if you want some super cool music go to epitonic, i've linked it.  you can create what they call a "blackbox" and put all kinds of nifty hard to find tunes in it.  it's fun!  and somewhat productive!  sheesh!  what more could you want?!?!

      hi friends...well, nathan and cat and i went to this acoustic open mike thing at the liquid lounge here in deep ellum.  neither of us played but we want to next time.  anyways, we heard 3 guys there from a new band here in dallas called "pherigo."  they were real nice and gave us a free 6 song cd that is also swell.  it's not often you get a free cd that you don't laugh at and then throw away at the nearest trash receptacle (i.e. - tek 9).  i don't like comparisons, especially because i think these guys stand well on their own, but i would recommend them if you like switchfoot and/or coldplay as a point of reference.  i've linked their website if you care to check them out.  you could probably write them if you're interested in getting your hands on a cd.  anyways, i also played the arcade classic last night...galaga.  and gues whose initials are the #1 high score?  that's right...rph.

      you can get the lowdown on saturday from my buddy pearce.  good times all around.  kenny h...if you read this i recommend a new found band, The Theater Fire, they are very cool.  sunday i went to my parents house and took a big nap and then ate dinner with them and lacy and blake, her boyfriend from cincinnati.  he goes to xavier and lives in norwood!  this is crazy because i was just in this neighborhood visiting community house.  then i went over to shane and alissa's and watched 2 more episodes of Band of Brothers...goodness.  today is rainy and lazy and labor day.  we're just sitting around the apartment in our boxers playing on computers.  logan's actually doing math homework.  well, rock and roll...

      blogging community, i got my checks from bank one in the mail today which also means...guess what?  i got my cincinnati public library card!  hooray!  so today i checked out several compact discs for my listening enjoyment:  jimi hendrix - wild blue angel (live double disc) ibrahim ferrar - if orget the title but he's from beuna vista social club ryan adams - heartbreaker  that's right.  libraries have all kinds of cool stuff.  you should get a card at yours.  but don't take my word for it...  also, this sunday i am going to  king's island  courtesy of the bells here at community house.  they had an eztra ticket so i get to com along.  it's paramount's theme park.  roller coasters and expensive food i'm sure. i'll tell you all about it.  i think they have a  scooby doo  ride.  rock!  on a final note...if you haven't seen the new homestar halloween cartoon or the malloween commercial, what are you waiting for?!?!

      hi friends... God has been good to me and i've had some good work opportunities the last couple of days.  yard work and painting/ dry walling.  it pays!  here's the strange part...the yard work was for the Detweilers, that's Karin and Linford of Over The Rhine; and the house work was for Ric Hordinski (former guitarist for OTR).  how surreal.    lots of people came for the "Pumpkin Carve-inal," ala Homestar Runner.  Awards were given just like on Homestar.  I got "worst place," for my alien head/spiderman/manga ninja thingy.  at least i didn't get "not last."  p.s. - check out the new homestar today!  later for now...

      tonight, my parents took logan, tanya, matt doherty, and me to the mavs preseason game against the utah jazz.  we lost, but that's cause we pulled our starters to let the spares get some action on the court.  anyways,  all  was not lost...  matt, logan, my dad, and i started  the gary busey spy club .  "gary busey spy club?" you ask?  that's right, the crazy guy who lived in a bus in the woods from the chris farley/david spade hit buddy comedy  black sheep .  he was introduced at the mavs game, cause he's a native texan.  so we proceeded to spy on him throughout the game with my dad's binoculars.    matt caught "gare", as we refer to him, hitting on a blond-haired woman in front of him.  she was not too thrilled about this and after too much busey pestering her, she proceeded to shove her wedding ring in his face.  busted "gare."    also, i saw him nab a chik-fil-a cow (the cows were throwing them into the stands).  the guy next to him seemed to really want it but "gare" wanted it more, so he nabbed it.  you'd think gary busey could afford to let the guy next to him have the cow and just go buy one if he really wanted it that bad.  later my dad spotted him talking to the blond again.  after taking a look for myself, it appeared that good old "gare" was making amends and putting things aright between himself and the married woman in front of him.  we think gary busey is a fun, interesting, wack-big-toothed fellow that is well worth spying on.  if you or anyone you know has had any experience spying on gary busey, please email me a resume and we will consider you as a potential member of  the g.b.s.c.    i leave for ohio in the morning...

      hi friends.  it was greatness to see you all in lubbock.  i will miss each of you.  i'm trying to get things together so that i can hit the road wednesday morning.  cat and i are going to caravan through texas, arkansas, tennessee, kentucky, and finally to cincinnati, ohio.  specifically norwood.    i think i've decided i want to be a writer.  but that requires writing.  and i could stand to do more of that.  i think it would be fun to go back to school and learn to be a writer and then travel everywhere writing memoirs and fiction.  wouldn't that be great?!  i think so.  last night, when we went to see  kill bill , i saw the previews for both  the matrix: revolutions  AND  the lord of the rings: return of the king .  holy scrap!  they both look soooo good.  i want to try and finish reading l.o.t.r. before the final movie hits this december.  i think it's do-able.    does anyone else out there grind their teeth in their sleep?  i do and it is not awesome.  i can feel it today from last night.  okay, i'm out of here.  peace...

       The curse of the bambino...  I think I'm a believer.  Logan, Chris, Nathan and I had roommate hang-out night so we went to Bennigan's after practice tonight to watch the last few innings of the Red Sox - Yankees series.  We were in the bar and somewhere around the 8th inning the waiter let Nathan pick out some songs from the virtual jukebox thing.  So when Aaron Boone stepped up in the 11th and smacked a homerun to seal the Red Sox fate,  Karma Police  by Radiohead comes on.  This is freaky...and I quote, "This is what you get when you mess with us."  Sick.  We leave weirded out and upset that the Yankees are going to the World Series.

      hi friends.  it looks like i'll have another review on  urlLink relevant 's website sooner or later.  it's for the book  henry's list of wrongs .  i'll let you know when it's up.

      yesterday i found a used copy of  urlLink thursday 's new cd,  war all the time  and picked it up for logan cause he wanted it.  it's really good.  smart, intense, melodic, innovative rock.  track 4, "signals over the air"  is especially sweet.  tonight my friend jimmy and i went to half price books.  i was looking for a cheap copy of  the catcher in the rye .  not in the "required reading" section.  not in general fiction.  i give up and go look at the used cds.  no flaming lips.  this is beginning to look like a fruitless quest.  then jimmy comes waltzing by and drops a copy of the jewel i'm seeking into the cd shelf i'm looking down at.  "where'd you find this?!"  "i have a way of finding things when others can't."  score.  thanks jimbo, you rule.  so i walk out with a slightly worn copy of j.d. salinger's master work for a mere $2.50.  not that freaking bad.  and jimmy found  the crystal cave  for a buck.  anyone remember that book?    then we came back to my apartment and watched  shanghai knights .  owen wilson is hilarious and jackie chan rules.  it was funny but i still liked  shanghai noon  better.    on a final note, i'm thinking about visiting lubbock before i take off for ohio.  maybe like getting in on sunday and staying til wednesday or so.  hopefully that'll work.

      so tawd bell here took me to a show last night at some house across the street from university of cincinnati.  apparently the girls that live there host punk rock shows in their basement.    the basement fits about 40-50 people + 4 bands' gear + a "stage" area, which isn't really a stage.  the ceilings are low with air ducts all over them, segregating the crowd by height.  there is lame graffitti on the walls and two album covers behind the "stage" - barbera streisand (gack!) and what appears to be a record of  the prophet  by kahlil girbran.  i wanted to steal it.  this crazy d.i.y. hole-in-the-ground venue is lit with one bright "corprate light" (as it was refered to) by the stairs and one lampshaded  60-watt lightbulb that swings back and forth grazing the vocalist's head.  it is packed with all manor of scenesters, from the hardcore/straight-edge kid to the guy with dreads longer and thicker than pythons to the cute girl wearing the exact same vans i have on (see, they  are  cool).  the show started lateer than expected with "fight like sinatra" from detroit.  cool name.  not so cool band.  3-piece.  sloppy.  out of tune.  not interested.  but hey, they seemed like nice enough guys.  the second band, though they take 12 years to set up, are well worth the wait.  they are called "silencio" and are from columbus.  they blow me away; i'm pleasantly surprised.  band breakdown: 1) one guy on electric guitar (he is genius) 2) one girl on keyboard (she rules too) 3) bass player/roland sound machine/moog player (sweet!) 4) drummer (also amazing).  they are instrumental, jazz/hardcore/math rock.  crazy hard rock and roll, sweet jazzy breakdowns.  altogether everyone is into it.  it reminded me of "questions in dialect" if they were harder.  "silencio," check 'em out.  band three is "sweetheart" - from columbus also.  i didn't pay much attention to them because i was roaming around outside calling logan to leave him a message.  sorry "sweetheart."  up last is "the dead hate the living," a cincy standard in female-fronted thrashy harcore.  though i can't really latch onto this kind of music anymore, they're fun and everyone is into it.  people are dancing and falling on the floor.  this is what a hardcore show should be.  on the last song the bass player sheds his instrument and joins the crowd, dancing in the pit.  rock AND roll.    afterwards we go to "sitwell's," a coffehouse/bar type place.  i have a hot chai (thanks for the spot tawd) and we get to talking to a couple of tawd's friends that are there.  then we went home and had some good conversation on the way back about our brokenness before God.  it was a good night.  this morning (between breakfast and chores) some of us went walking the neighborhood to begin asking God and listening to Him as to how we can "love our neighbors as ourselves."  if you think about it, pray for norwood, that we at community house and vineyard central would have opportunities to actively and relationally love our neighbors; and that God's kingdom would be revealed in our community.  peace out...enjoy the weekend.

      the following is fairly deep but worth the read, i promise...  "Strong emotions and deep feelings, or seeking after signs, can be more dangerous than helpful...God will lead you, almost without your knowing it, if you will be faithful to come before Him quietly.  Eat of Him and His word.  For if you love Him, everything else will work out.  I am not asking you for a tender and emotional love, but simply that you lean toward love.  Put God before yourself and the world and even your evil desires will begin to be transformed." -Francois Fenelon  The Seeking Heart

      friends, texans, countrymen...  lots more happening today!  1) raked leaves in the yard between our house, the brown house, and the church building.  we raked so many freaking leaves up!  wow.  it's not like this in texas.  we raked up a pile that was as big as two cars.  honestly.  2) there was a fund raiser a few months ago in whicha lot of canned goods were collected.  so we got to pach them up and drive them to the foodbank this afternoon.  in the process of packing them up i came across the most horrendous and freakish bug ever.  it was about an inch and a half long and looked like some freakish hybrid of a spider, centipede, and a silverfish.  sick.  sick sick sick.  3) cat and i put together an ikea nightstand and i did a dresser all by myself!  look at me now Dad!  it's like legos for big people!  4) after praying and thinking about urban outfitters and talking with s few people here, i just didn't have the best feeling about it in terms of flexability, pay, and enjoyability.  anyways, i ended up getting a call from kevin rains who lives in the brown house and is also the sort of head pastor of vineyard central.  well he owns a car detailing shop and just opened another here in norwood.  he asked if i would be interested in doing a combination of some office work and some basic shop work (washing a car here and there, that sort of thing).  so i go in tomorrow!  this is cool cause it will pay well and kevin will be a lot more sensitive to my situation than any other boss.  so...trusting in God to take care of things = good.  5) kenny havens and i ran 2 miles before dinner.  slowly, but we did it.  he held up a good deal better than me.  6)  matrix  tomorrow!  7) love and peace...

      hey friends...lots of interesting stuf to blog about.  1) watched the movie  solaris  last night here at the house.  very interesting.  starring george clooney, directed by steven soderburg.  visually stunning.  the plot raised some intriguing philosophical/mental/spiritual questions.  it's definitley not a thriller, so it's not fast paced, but to me, it was worth it.  2) going to see the final  matrix  thursday night with a crew of housemates here.  3) went to a cool old cathedral which is now being renovated into a community/spiritual center and coffee shop/bookstore.  the coolest faith-based bookstore i've ever been in.  so while we were there (sharon, abby & nora, and cat) we walked down the street to urban outfitters cause sharon knows one of the managers.  i ended up getting a application and bringing it back.  for some crazy reason they want to interview me tomorrow.  wow.  unexpected.  but, i've also applied to this cool market called "wild oats" and a bookstore called "joseph beth."  i would rather work at these, so i'll call them tomorrow before the urban interview.  i'd appreciate your prayers for wisdom and God's leading  4) our church gathering at the house was really cool tonight.  it started off with dave leading in some discussion about the early church and the purpose of meeting together and then we got into talking about what tawd called "charismocracy" - or the Holy Spirit leading our time together.  and what followed was just that.  nothing crazy or mind boggling, but a really Spirit-led time of encouragement, teaching, edification, and worship.  it was good.  God is good.    5) that's all.  love and peace...

      weirdness.  the henry family went to the new nasher sculpture museum next to the d.m.a. in the dallas art district today and guess who was also there sporting a pair of dark sunglasses and hanging out with his model girlfriend?   ...luke wilson.  totally strange.  i got him to sign my chest with a sharpie i carry around just in case something like that ever happens.  just kidding, we didn't say anything to him.  it was definitely surreal though.  then we ate at freebirds.  yes!  and went to central market where my dad found a thing of cherry gummis mispriced at .12 cents.  yes again!  and then we went to half price books where everythig was 20% off.  what the heck?!  could the day get any better?!  now i'm gonna go see my friends scott griffith and sean corbray.  bringin' in the new year!

       interesting and fun things i did this weekend...    friday  went to the art show/benefit concert for st. elizabeth's -good music, quality art, conversation, food, inspiration  afterwards, went to "the chili company" with a gang of people -standard late night greasy spoon.  laughed hard at one particular item on the menu: "the sea dog."  imagined it being two fish sticks in a hot dog bun and having to order it with a pirate accent..."arggg, fetch me a sea dog ye salty wench!"  more hard laughter.   saturday  ran lots of errands -Christmas presents, oil change, bank, library...  met up with cat wayne and john wilson browning -drank good coffee from pleasant perk.  looked at cds at everybodys records.  cat bought low, wilson bought tom waits.  went to the earth, the sweetest vintage toy store i have ever been to...drooled over various g.i. joe, star wars, and he-man figures.  some highlights: air-tight, barbeque, flint, snake eyes (the badest mother of all), quick kick, jabba the hut, the rancor, lobster man, skeletor, the list goes on and on.  it was so rad.  and you could buy figures missing their weapons for like 2-3 bucks!  nostalgic joy.  all group -hot, free, good soup.  Christmas songs, candles, scripture, teaching, listening, meeting people, interactive worship stations.  one station had two large plastic bins on a table.  one full of gold Christmas tree decoration balls, one empty, two permanent markers, and two rubber mallets.  the idea was to write a word or phrase on the gold ball that represented a consumeristic, materialistic, idolatrous, or false view anyone had of Jesus that they wanted to confess - then stick it in the empty bin and smash it to bits.  very concrete way of confessing.  post-all group hang out -tawd, elizabeth, cat, wilson, and i went to avant garage, a cool second-hand store and then the comet, a bar/restaurant/music venue.  cat found an "I Love Texas" mug and lent me 3 bucks to buy it.  at last...the holy grail!  then we hung out at the comet: ate, drank, and watched a heavy metal band.  it was rad.   post post-all group hang out -same people.  convent living room.  conversation about anything and everything.  disagreements, new ideas, old ideas, love all around.   sunday    drive to nashville, tennessee and back -weird.  over the rhine forgot to leave a bass guitar with rick plant, who toured with them.  turns out its got a strange shape and is real expensive, so it can't be shipped - and he needs it by sunday night.  so karin offers to cut me a check to make the 9 hour round trip.  i listened to john krakauer's  into thin air , about the botched mt. everest expedition in '96 (thanks dave) so the time passed easily.  bass delivered, downtown seen, cheesy and vile postcard purchased, cracker barrel enjoyed.  i arrive back at the house around 10:30pm and sleep hard.  the end.  tomorrow i go home to texas.  ps...read about a  urlLink muslim  who is more tolerant than a lot of Christians.  maybe we could learn a thing or two.    pps...send a Christmas  urlLink iconogram .

      ahhhhhhhhh...snap!  sup fools.  just got back from hanging Christmas lights over at the church building for this art show/concert/benefit thing friday.  i like hanging lights.  they are sparkly and warm.  prepping stuff for friday makes me wish i still created art.  i really really liked my art classes in high school...it's lame, but i think because i'm not forced to, for a grade, i don't do anything artistic anymore (besides play my guitar - i guess i mean visually).  i should start drawing again.  i should do lots of things...one of which is go to bed.  i leave you with a current listening/reading list (inspired by nathan's)...   listening  dave brubek quartet -  so what's new?  john coltrane -  "best of" type album  (i forget the title) cake -  comfort eagle    reading  wolfgang simson -  houses that change the world  sister helen prejean -  dead man walking

      yesterday i worked about 9 hours!  refreshment was on the way though because afterwards we went to the over the rhine X-mas show.  susan enan (from ireland) and pedro the lion were the openers.  susan enan was a very laid back solo "folkie" (to borrow a term from sharon bell) with an acoustic guitar.  i enjoyed it.  then...pedro.  rock.  it was david bazan and t.w. walsh on drums.  they had the bass on a track like at cornerstone.  but it rocked.  it was mostly stuff from  it's hard to find a friend  but he played a few new ones too, so that was cool.    then otr was up.  i have to admit i was more pumped about ptl initially, but over the rhine blew me away.  for real.  especially "jack's valentine."  rock  and  roll.  it was great.  and  then , since our household tickets were from otr, we got backstage passes.  sweet you'd think, right?  backstage was not as glamorous as i pictured.  it looked like someone's basement full of garage sale furniture and left over food.  i mean, i'm not complaining at all...i just assumed backstage was a much cooler place than it actually turned out to be.  but the concert was excellent and i thanked karin and linford for the free tickets.  they're so nice!  then we tried to find a food spot and failed several times, so we all went home and hung out in the living room.    today some of us went to the local elementary school to help out with a free holiday carnival put on by the big vineyard here for the kids in norwood.  it was fun, i passed out candy and ran the bean bag toss.  kids are pumped about candy.  even if it's just some tootsie rolls or whatever.  cool, well, not much else planned for the weekend.  maybe i'll take a nap.  party.

      things i am learning...  - pride and selfishness are sneaky sins hiding out in the midst of many "good deeds." - we often fool ourselves into thinking we're trusting God when we're really either trusting our apparent ability to live the "Christian life" or trusting our own understanding. - i need to be more honest. - family and friends are way more important than i can even say. - spending or not spending time with God daily, takes its toll, for better or worse, on how i handle my life.  - i am often obsessed with being "useful" to God, instead of obsessed with loving Him.  feel free to add your own.  they don't have to be all "spiritual" or whatever.  but really, somehow, everything is i think.

      hey everybody.  a couple funny things happened at/around work today that i thought i'd share...   incident #1  the street next to the body shop (cleneay) hits montgomery (the main street) at an angle, so the line to stop at is much farther back than the crosswalk or the actual intersection.  i've learned the hard way why when i've had to back up (more than once) for big 18-wheelers trying to turn onto this side street.  also, it's even a tight fit for cars to get around you if you're sticking out too far.  honks, angry drivers, etc.  okay, here's where i'm going...today as i was going back to the house for lunch i pull up to the line as i am the first one at the stop light.  i put on my blinker to turn left when i get a green.  two cars and an 18-wheeler and then a butt-load more cars end up behind me.  one of these cars honks, like for me to move up so people can turn right as i wait to turn left.  fine, i hate to do this and get cut off again but okay.  so i pull about half my car over the stop line.  there.  not enough.  honking mayhem ensues and the truckers gets out of his freaking big rig and walks up to my door!  i roll down the window.    "man you gonna have to move forward, we gonna be here all day!"  i reply, "if i move forward, another big truck like yours may cut me off."  (this has happened before plenty of times, as i said)  "well then go right or somethin', we gonna be here all day!"  then irony kicks in: as he finishes his sentence the light turns green and i speed off.  he is stuck outside his ride several cars away and the light is green.  way to go ace.  if the cars behind him were annoyed by me, i'm sure  he really  pissed them off.     incident #2  around 4:45, the area around the shop turns into the set from the hitchcock movie the birds.  they swarm and poo everywhere.  they crap up cars i just washed.  curse you flying fecal flingers!  anyways, this same side street is basically their latrine.  along the side of the street that i park on are powerlines and the birds use these like communal crappers, covering the sidewalk.    as i'm walking to my car i realize this and begin to dodge poo like indiana jones dodging poisonous darts.  i can see it and hear it splatting on the ground everywhere.  it's a minefield of bird poo!  i get into my car untouched.  thank You God!  and go back to the house.  when i get out i realize the right side of my car is covered.  it looks like a freaking jackson pollock painting.  no lie:  i spotted around 100 poo splatters.  sick.  this is the lesson i have learned today: cleneay is not a good street in any way whatsoever.  i need somewhere new to park.  well, it's almost time for dinner.  i'm out.  peace...

      hello friends and family.  i just got back to cincinnati after a good thanksgiving.  family is good.  so good.  i can't wait to see my mom and dad and brother and sister again and go sking.  december 23rd...  my aunt and uncle and their 5 kids (that i caravaned with to st. louis) live in marion, indiana.  it's about 2 hours and 45 minutes from here.  so that's good to know.  that i have family so close that i can go see on the weekend or whatever.    today, while driving, i thought a lot about female companionship.  i have no one in my sights but i am wishing i had a girlfriend right now.  i know that's so lame and cheesy.  whatever.  it's just been a long time since i've even been out on a date with someone i'm interested in romantically.  i think like a year and a half.  beat that!  but i'm sure a lot of it stems from the fact that traveling for some reason makes it harder to make time for God and as a result i haven't spent much quality time with him over the break.  that and the fact that i listened to matt wertz's new cd like 4 times today.  i am weak.  i need to spend some time with God.  i need to be honest with him.  i need to learn to be content in all circumstances.  i need to trust him.  help me God.

      i would really appreciate everyone's comments on this one...  reading 1 corinthinas 13, st. paul says, "if i sell all my possessions to feed the poor but do not have love...it profits me nothing."  what is love?  more specifically, how do i love God and my neighbor as Jesus commands?  if love is not just action, as paul states, and it isn't just a mushy infatuated feeling...what is it?

      salutations. my (past) weekend:   friday  ate dinner with the household, watched  grosse point blank  (with john cusak), and read a conscious grating article about the poverty of india.   saturday  painted some studio space in the church building with cat (made some extra cash doing so).  then we went to half price books and barnes and noble (gift card).  walked away with a copy of  walk in the light while there is light  by leo tolstoy (ala tawd's recommendation), a journal, and a cafe mocha.  went to our friend rachel's house for dinner.  she made some rad mexican food (i miss you texas!) and we hung out with her and her boyfriend jesus (not the messiah, a guy from cancun).  then i watched the movie  kandahar .  it's about this woman who is trying to get from iran into kandahar, afghanistan.  very good.  we have blinders on our worldview way too often.   sunday  slept until almost noon.  right on.  cleaned my room, did some laundry.  finished an article for relevant - hopefully they'll use it.  went with tawd to amol india, this really good indian restaurant.  thanks for the coupon kenny!  then we got hot drinks from sitwells.  thanks tawd!  talked to mom and dad.  watched  cowboy bebop  (really popular anime series) with tawd and nora.  went to bed.  welcome monday...

      hey everyone. i did some real "body shop" work today.  i took apart the back door of a van and took another one off (with kevin's help) AND removed some adhesive gunk from a car door with a sweet power tool.  tawd's painting the front room and the office.  it's green.    what else is new, let's see...not much i guess.  i'm finally starting to get back into the groove of my schedule after severely throwing it off over the christmas break by staying up til 4am and waking up at noon.  sheesh.  oh, here's something cool...i think cat and i are going to chicago to visit her friends erin and kate in a couple weekends.  and here's the really cool part: the appleseed cast are playing at the metro that weekend!  right on.  so, funds allowing and God willing, i think i will go to the windy city the weekend after this one.

      it's been a while...  christmas and new years were good.  skiing was good.  family and friends are good.  being home was good.  God has blessed my life beyond reason.  thanks.  what would you do if you knew without a doubt that the world was going to end in 2 years?  what would i do?  why don't we live our lives like that?  most of us are just bored and settled.  why?  i think we're afraid to fail.  at least, i think i am.  one thing that seems to be surfacing a lot this christmas break is this: now is the time.  "seize the day," if you will, ala dead poets society.  if we don't do what we're passionate about now, when will we ever do it?  go out and fail if that's what it takes. take risks, suffer, live life, fall down, and get back up.  i want this.  it is my prayer.

      yesterday at center city collision i talked with a customer named lindell speed.  he's a young african-american guy who drives a grand prix or grand am or one of those grand whatevers.  he listens to twista and outkast and has a sony xplod subwoofer in his trunk.  he wears a black cap with an embroidered skeleton hand on it giving the "ok" sign and sports a trimed beard and glasses.  he's had to come in more than once as problems resulting from a previous wreck surface over time.    we sit around in the office waiting.  since i'm the only one at the shop, we have to wait for pat to get back from lunch so i can drive lindell home while pat works on his car.  somehow we get to talking about where i live and he asks me, "so it's like mtv cribs?!"  he's obviously joking but also curious.  we get to talking about house church and he asks if we're "like Jehovah's Witnesses or something?"  "ya'll go door to door and stuff?"  no not really, i tell him.  we talk a bit about how church is the Body, wherever that might be - not just a building or a time of week.    pat gets back with his lunch so get in lindell's car to back it into the garage.  this is hard in a two-lane, two-way street right next to a stop light.  i take it slow and hold up traffic, lurching and angling into the garage.  twista thumps in the trunk.  i get out.  "you get scared?" i ask him smiling.  "you drive like a grandma man!"  we all laugh.  it's hard backing into a garage on a two way street.  you try it.  i take lindell home in my car.  as we near his house we see the mail jeep.  "man, we got a late-ass mailman!" complains lindell.  "mailmen be late in black neighborhoods, they on c.p. time."  he proceeds to inform me that c.p. stands for "colored people." we pull up to his house and i drop him off as he gets out he says, "thanks my man."  "alright," i say, "we'll look for you around five."

      what were we created for?  i'm not asking why.  i'm asking what for?  what were we made to do?  if we could go back to eden and start all over again and not screw it up, what would we do as humans?  is everything in life just context?  context in which we relate to God and/or other people?  is the only important thing other-ness?  jobs, the cities we live in, the things we're interested in, nature, houses, food, music, art, clothes...  what is the point of it all if not for "the other?"  whether that be God or a wife or a friend or an enemy or a stranger.  it seems it is all only the medium in which we find ourselves interacting.  the medium used to exist in relation to Deity and humanity.  i don't know what this rant is all about really...take it for what you will...

      i shaved today and, therefore, look about 5 years younger.  it's weird.  my room is clean and my laundry is no longer overflowing.  it was starting to look like the talking trash heap from  fraggle rock .  i used some of my gift card at target today and got some lip balm, hot tamales (the candy), and dr. pepper.  yes!  last night, some of us watched  strictly ballroom  at the brown house.  wow.  cheesy, campy, and full of dancing.  it  was  funny, but dudes beware.    some of us have scheduled a week long retreat in april to  urlLink the abbey of gethsemani .  this is where thomas merton lived.  i'll get to stay in the south wing of the monastery.  i'm actually making progress in the books i'm reading right now.  instead of just thinking they look cool and only reading about the first 20 pages or so.

      A U.S. Presidential Commission on World Hunger (composed of Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals) repeated this warning:  "The most potentially explosive force in the world today is the frustrated desire of poor people to obtain a decent standard of living...The Commission believes that promoting economic development in general, and overcoming hunger in particular, are tasks far more critical to U.S. national securitythan most policy makers acknowledge or even believe.  Since the advent of nuclear weapons, most Americans have been conditioned to equate national security with the strength of strategic military forces.  The Commission consideers this prevailing belief to be a simplistic illusion."

      what if our biggest problem in being "followers of Christ" is not so much that we are unwilling to follow Him, but that we think that we  are ?  what if we have deluded ourselves into following "Christianity" or having "correct doctrine" and in all actuality are not really  doing  those things which Jesus taught and commanded us to do as His disciples?  how many of us really bless those who curse us? how many of us really give to all who ask of us?  how many of us would be willing to subject ourselves to further humiliation when struck in the face?  how many of us seek the kingdom of God first?  may we take a long hard look at what our Lord teaches and may He give us the grace to live it out.  "Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man who built his house on the rock.  And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.    "Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.  The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell--and great was its fall."   - Jesus Christ (matthew 7:24-27)

       cognitive minority ,  def.  group(s) of people who hold a set of beliefs that differ sharply from the majority view in their society  "Unless our theologian has the inner fortitufe of a desert saint, he has only one effective remedy against the threat of cognitive collapse in the face of these pressures.  He must huddle together with like-minded fellow deviants - and huddle very closely indeed.  Only in a countercommunity of considerable strength does cognitive deviance have a chance to maintain itself.  The countercommunity provides continuing therapy against the creeping doubt as to whether, after all, one may not be wrong and the majority right.  To fulfill its function of providing social support for the deviant body of "knowledge," the countercommunity must provide a strong sense of solidarity among its members." -sociologist Peter Berger, as quoted in  Rich Christians In an Age of Hunger   here's to being a "cognitive deviant."

       "How to Teach Your Pet to Talk"    Remember all those cartoons you watched as a child? How all the animals could talk? Most people think that stuff's all made up and pretend. But it's not. Where do you think they came up with the idea for talking animals? Obviously, they are out there. They just need to be taught. So if you'd like to teach your pet to talk, here are three simple steps to doing so:    Step 1) Have a pet.   This can be a dog or a cat or a chinchilla, whatever. It doesn't really matter. Just keep in mind, teaching your pet to talk is definitely going to freak some people out. That said, be forewarned...if you have a talking iguana, people might be more freaked out than if you have a talking dog or whatever.   (The reason this 3-step process is for "pets" is because no one wants talking animals  everywhere . I mean, come on, it's cool if it's your pet, but who wants to make conversation with like, pigeons or whatever at the bus stop? Not me. That's for sure.)    Step 2) Invent a "Teach Your Pet to Talk" machine.   This could be like, virtual reality or involve electrodes into your pet's brain or any other mad-scientist type stuff. Just make sure it's a pet-friendly device or system or what have you. After all, you're teaching your pet to talk, the last thing you want is your pet complaining to you for the rest of it's life about how painful it was to learn how to talk.    Step 3) Show off your pet's linguistic skills.   Some of you out there may just be looking for a faithful friend to talk to and listen to you, and certainly your talking pet will be this for you, but there's also an opportunity to manage your pet's up and coming career as a Professional Talking Pet (known as PTPs in "the business"). The possibilities here are endless. Talent shows, party tricks, street performance, you name it. The sky is the limit. Just make sure you're fair with your PTP. 50-50 even split.

      i changed my drudge report link to a cnn link.  the reason being is that matt drudge had nothing better to rail on john kerry about than the four-letter words found on his official website.  what?!  are we in kindergarten?  aren't there more important political issues out there than candidates' vocabulary choices?

      today at the shop was rad for many reasons:  1) tim's birthday.  tim is freaking hilarious.  easily one of the funniest guys i know. 2) because of tim's birthday, kevin bought everyone fuddrucker's.  careful how you say that.  it was "so good!"  we also got goodies from the pony keg across the street!  (ho ho's and cokes)   3) after lunch i went downtown to the carew tower cause there's a cingular store down there.  (the weather was amazing - sunny and 70 degrees)  i thought i needed my phone serviced and a new battery maybe, but nope.  everything worked like a charm when i let the guy mess with it.  let's hope it stays fixed. 4) finally, we took technique photos for the upcoming website ridgemasters.com...beware of The Ridge...

      we bear the image of Deity yet we are fallen.  the psalmist says none seek God  and  says God has not forsaken those who seek him.  God made men upright, but they have sought out "many devices." (ecc. 7:29)  who are we?  did adam and eve cause us to inherit sin, or death?  have we all fallen in our own personal gardens?  was i born into sin or did i fall into it?  am i a mixture of the Divine image and a sinful distortion of that image?

      well, back from the abbey...strange to go from such quiet just right back into normal life.  the weirdest thing that happened was i was in the lunch line and noticed several guys wearing "hip" and "cool" clothes with "stylish" haircuts and such.  guess who...  chris tomlin and his band are just hanging out at the abbey of gethsemani.  what?!  it was strange.  they were only there for like half a day, but it was still weird to see "passion" guys chillin at a monastery.  anyway, it was a good experience...lots of time for prayer, meditation, hiking, and just relaxing.  kentucky's really pretty.  the only bummer was i thought i took all these sweet photos of some really cool statues and nature shots but dumbhead that i am...there was no film in my camera.  dur....  i'm sure cat will put some on her fotopage though.

      yesterday... the morning was full of shoveling dirt and gravel to make some progress on enlarging our driveway.  we screwed up and dug too deep, giving us the humbling task of taking the wheel barrow back to the moved dirt, shoveling it back in, and hauling it back to the ditch in the parking lot.  sheesh.  somehow though, we got it level and filled with enough gravel (for the time being) to leave at around 2 or so to disc golf while many women filled the convent in celebration of the coming havens child.    kenny, matthias, and i went to taylor mill, kentucky and played on the most enjoyable 18 hole course i've ever played on...pride park.  though it wasn't a pdga manicured course, it was greatness.  green grass, huge hills and valleys, and a creek running through the middle of it complete with a wooden bridge.  one of the holes was named after a guy named "chainsaw."  yes!  it ruled.  on the last hole i thought i lost my frisbee and as i scouted for it, i stumbled upon a treasure!  an old rusty machete!  this was either some long forgotten trail-cutting tool, or a murder weapon.  either way i took it.  cause old rusty machetes are just cool.  then some of us went to dewey's pizza, mmm... and watched the ben stiller movie,  duplex  at the brown house.  good day, good day.

       all we have is now  ala  the flaming lips ...  As logic stands you couldn't meet a man  Who's from the future. But logic broke As he appeared he spoke  About the future  "We're not gonna make it" He explained how the end will come You and me were never meant to be Part of the future  All we have is now All we've ever had is now All we have is now All we've ever had is now  I noticed that he had a watch and hat that looked familiar He was me From a dimension torn free Of the future  "We're not gonna make it" He explained how the end will come You and me were never meant to be Part of the future  All we have is now All we've ever had is now All we have is now All we've ever had is now    that's pretty darn sermon on the mount if you ask me.

      as i was sanding floors this week, i was astounded at the amount of random songs that floated around in my mind.  refusing to go away.  lingering even subconsciously under my brain.  "heal the world" was the worst one.  songs i haven't thought of in years.    then i thought...what if i had not bombarded my brain with media and noise for the past 20something years?  what if i had lived in solitude all my life.  hearing only the sound of my own voice and actions and nature around me.  i know, it's a weird thought.  sanding floors affords you those.  anyway, would things like the sound of a certain bird's voice, or the way wind sounded in trees, or a the water of a certain rushing river be the sounds floating around trapped in my head?    you know those detox drinks or programs or whatever that one uses to rid the body of drugs or impurities?  i wish i could do that for all the mindless blah blah blah media stuck in my gray matter.  also, i want to see the new charlie kaufman movie with jim carrey.  isn't that ridiculously ironic?

      in an effort to stay up on current events, here ya go...  In 1968, during the Vietnam War, Lt. William Calley ordered the massacre of the entire village of My Lai (innocent men, women, and children) though no Vietcong were present.  He blamed his actions on orders from higher-ups in the military, but with no substantial evidence, only Calley was convicted.  A journalist named Seymour Hersh brought the scandal to public attention in an article he would write a year later.  Why is this relevant?  Seymour Hersh is also the journalist who recently penned the now controversial  urlLink New Yorker article  on the abuse scandals of the Abu Ghraib U.S. military prison in Iraq.  It seems to be an eerily similar situtaion in which Staff Sergeant Ivan L. Frederick II blames his behavior on the orders of military intelligence (much like Calley who blamed his higher-ups).  I wouldn't be surprised if this is as big as Hersh writes.  We'll see...

      "Now we know that You know all things, and have no need for anyone to question You; by this we believe that You came from God," the disciples exlaim with unwavering assurance.  Jesus answers them, "Do you now believe?  Behold, an hour is coming, and  has  come, for you to be scattered, each to his own {home,} and to leave Me alone..." Jesus replies, speaking of his disciples'  forthcoming desertion of Him in Gethsemane.  I see myself in the disciples.  So willing to make over-confident assertions of my own faith and belief, yet often faltering in actual practice.  I hear Jesus, "Do you  now  believe?"  And I realize that my faith is a quest.  Salvation is more than a one time event.  It must have a starting point, yes, but salvation is ongoing in us as we learn from Jesus - how to follow Him and how to be at home in His kingdom.  I think Brian McLaren said something like, many of us have taken a "starting line" and turned it into a "finish line."  Dallas Willard sums it up really well in his book  The Divine Conspiracy :  "Understanding this helps dispell the common misconception that those who are studying with Jesus have already realized in themselves the vision and practice of the kingdom...  "Jesus' disciples are those who have chosen to be with him to learn to be like him.  Al they have necessarily realized at the outset of their apprectinceship to him is,  Jesus is right .  He is the greatest and best.  Of this, they are sure.  That initial faith is God's gift of grace to them.  So they have  him .  They do not yet have 'it.'  And as they move along they do indeed attain, by increasing grace, to an 'advanced spiritual condition....'  "To enter his kingdom, we believe in him.  To be at home in his kingdom, learning to reign with him there, we must share his beliefs."  Since this faith is a journey, full of pitfalls and mountaintops, we will continue to fall from time to time, from the faith-rhetoric we unabashedly proclaim.  The voice of the Teacher, the Master comes to us; piercing, yet full of grace..."Do you  now  believe?"  He knows our next fall.  Our next Gethsemane desertion.  But thankfully He is merciful.  And if we will get back up and continue following Him, seeking Him, believing what we madly and sometimes haphazardly proclaim to be true, His promise is to lead us into fullness of joy and a truly abundant life.

      well, blogger got the hooks-ups now that google owns them.  they have lots of new, really nice templates now too.  alsoooo... they have a commenting system finally!  hooray.  so, shedding a few tears over all the past comments that would be jettisoned into the far reaches of cyberspace, i got a new template, dumped haloscan, and am using blogger for comments now.  that said, i hope you enjoy the new look.  it felt more classic to me.  one thing is, if you are not a registered user of blogger, you may have to type your name in the text of your comment for it not to show up "anonymous."  i'm not for sure though.  give it a whirl...

      i have not been blogging much lately because i am trying to refresh my memory on american history and such for a TExES test i have to take on may 22 in order to be certifiable.  it's the content test for 4-8 grade social studies - this covers world and u.s. history and culture, geography, government, and economics.  lots to cover and i obviously can't hit it all, so please pray for me that i pass it.  it's amazing how much one can forget what he learned years ago in school...  matthias here has lots of new photos on his fotopage...go check it out.  logan got me elbow's  cast of thousands  for my birthday and it has been in heavy rotation.  sooo good!  saw  the last samurai .  enjoyed it but it reminded me a lot of  dances with wolves  as far as the plot was concerned - though tranplanted to japan instead of the american west.  this is not a bad thing, as i like  dances with wolves  (bring on the kevin costner-hating).  anyway, it was beautiful and now japan is added to the list of countries i want to visit.  happy mother's day Mom!

      life has a strange way of coming full circle...one year i'm at over the rhine's merchandise table talking with the guy behind the counter about a thing called community house in cincinnati; the next year i  am  the guy behind the merch table.    this past thursday through saturday i was able to do a short 3-day stint with over the rhine in columbus, cincinnati, and lexington (kentucky) as the merch guy.  setting up the table, hauling stuff around, selling t-shirts and cds a plenty.  sometimes i marvel at how good life really is.  it was bittersweet though because at the best western in columbus, just about all otr's gear was stolen.  someone clipped the lock on the trailer and did a professional job of taking everything but a hammond organ.  and then, as if that wasn't enough, on saturday the van that tawd bell and i were driving broke down on the way to lexington.  though it seems i may have been some sort of bad luck charm, i'm grateful for the experience.  sunday morning i woke up early and headed out for new york city with cat, matthias, kim, and elizabeth.  thanks to jim and jerolyn morrison (family friends) we had a free place to stay the night and were extremely well taken care of.  in one night and the next day we naviagated many a subway trains, took the staten island ferry, walked the brooklyn bridge, wandered through central park (matthias went up the empire state building), did st. thomas, st. pat's and rockafeller on 5th avenue, ate in grand central station, marveled at the people and the lights in times square (toys r us is so fun!), and saw the former world trade center.    as of now i am in new hampshire, staying with cat wayne's family, taking it easy.  i think we're going to see the ocean, hike in the white mountains, and spend some time in boston.  life is good.  thanks God.

      well, my parents were here for the weekend and we had a blast.  i'm glad they got to come visit me in ohio.  we went to newport where we ate at a seafood place called the fish market and i got the 21 grams soundtrack and a book called  urlLink baghdad express . to be read after  into the wild  by jon krakauer.  (it's excellent by the way.)    then we tried to watch some boat racing on the ohio from sawyer park but the river had too much debris (mostly tree trunks and stuff), so the coast guard called it off.  but sawyer was really nice.  when we got back to the house, we hung out with kenny, marissa, and josie for a while and then went to chuck e. cheese's with sofie, izaac, and zoe.  i got 2 100s on one round of skeeball.  the prizes are really terrible though.  i never realized it when i was a little kid.  after that we went to see matt murray and kim nixon at bar humbug in covington.  they did a great job and it was a lot of fun.  yesterday we went for breakfast at sugar 'n spice, watched some city league baseball, played wiffle ball, saw  dodgeball , and went out for dinner at buca di beppo with the nixon clan.    a good time was had by all and the weather was perfect.  we got my dad a digital camera for father's day, so be sure to check out his forthcoming fotopage.  i've linked it below.

      anyone ever feel spiritually numb?  no amazing life lessons, no earth shattering spiritual truths coming to light... nothing i can feel anyway.  i hope God is moving somewhere under the radar.  part of this may be due to a slacking off in getting alone with God.  i'm trying to change up my alone time with Him by praying in my mind and heart instead of always using my journal to write out my prayers.  this was an extremely helpful practice that i started when i felt like God was a million miles away and i wanted to be honest.  but now i think it's time for something different.  i don't want to end up feeling stuck, and like i can't pray without a pen and my trusty journal.  that said, it's been very difiicult for me to pray coherently in the mornings (even with the coffee).  i trail off into thoughts about the day ahead or thoughts about last night's dreams.  i guess being coherent isn't a prerequisite for God to listen to me.  i just have to trust that, "the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him."  kids with a.d.d. have always baffled me, but most mornings that's what i feel like trying to talk with God.

      what's up y'all.  thanks for the mass comments lately.  no sarcasm here.  i'm not bitter.  really.  let's see...i just got back from a umc youth camp with junior high kids - 4 out of the 13 in my cabin had severe ADHD.  some highlights...and lowlights  -finding a mouse in my dresser and watching the boys run around the cabin and kill it with a broom.  so hilarious. -canoe trip down the little miami river.  it was supposed to be 3 miles long.  yeah, so uh, we missed our pull-out point so it turned into a 6 mile trip. -breaking up several fights. -jumping off the "pampers pole" - a 30 foot pole with a little platform i had to stand up on and jump about 8 feet from to a trapeze bar.  so fun. -watching my "family group" get to know, like, and hang out with one another of their own free will. -big bonfire. -standing watch over my boys until about 2 o'clock when they finally shut up and stayed in bed. -junior high kids dancing and singing to 'undignified,' 'sing like the saved,' and 'those who trust.' -hanging out with my co-counselor steve minor. -camper vs. counselor dodgeball series.  we lost but we were out numbered by like 6 to 1.  well, i'm gonna go spend a few days in north carolina with my dad so i won't be back until late tuesday.  rock and roll.  love and peace to you all...

      tonight kenny, marissa and josie came over and we got take-out from thai express.  the red curry chicken dish is mind blowing.  i love it so much.  thai food is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  then we sat down for a game of cranium.  traditional.  guys vs girls.  we lost.  but that's okay because i got a sweet autographed picture of R2-D2 from kenny.  you wouldn't believe how realistic it looks.  i wish i had a scanner so i could show everyone how amazing this R2-D2 is.  after that i decided to take a late night walk around the neighborhood and ended up finding people hanging out in steve and becky's backyard across the street from the convent/brownhouse courtyard.  we talked around a fire pit out back and then moved inside for a while.  steve has some unbelievably hilarious and entertaining stories.  he told me one tonight about going to a 60-hour movie marathon (at this place that used to run classic movies here in cincinnati - i can't remember the name) in order to win a year long pass.  anyways, he ended up getting called a "motherf%$#@!" by one of the midgets from the movie  time bandits !  crazy huh?  i leave you with...  secret of the easy yoke  -  pedro the lion  i could hear the church bells ringing they pealed aloud your praise the members faces were smiling with their hands out stretched to shake it's true they did not move me my heart was hard and tired their perfect fire annoyed me i could not find you anywhere  could someone please tell me the story of sinners ransomed from the fall i still have never seen you and some days i don't love you at all  the devoted were wearing bracelets to remind them why they came some concrete motivation when the abstract could not do the same but if all that's left is duty i'm falling on my sword at least then i would not serve an unseen distant lord  if this is ony a test i hope that i'm passing cause i'm losing steam and i still want to trust you  peace be still

      matthias and i left for columbus after lunch yesterday and spent the night with tawd bell...  we walked haku (the bell's australian sheep dog) around high street and the o.s.u. campus.  we checked out  evolved , the piercing/tattoo shop tawd will be apprenticing in.  we ate some awesome pizza at  hound dogs .  we hung out with some of the landing place crew at  the shi-sha , a cool hookah bar/coffee shop/hang-out lounge.  then tawd, the german, and i went to a late showing of  fahrenheit 9/11 .  pretty compelling.  this morning we had  buckeye donuts  (i burnt my tongue on the coffee - sheesh), stopped by 64 king to hang out for about 20 minutes, and walked around downtown for about another 20 minutes so matthias could take some photos of the buildings and stuff.  it was a great time.    here's an unrelated quote for the day: "Do not be one of those who, rather than risk failure, never attempts anything" -Thomas Merton,  New Seeds of Contemplation

      while road-tripping in new england, completely out of the blue i ran into an old friend, sean horton (of red crown records fame and lore). he is now the curator of a cool gallery in burlington, vermont which is located in an old renovated firehouse on church st.  it was surreal.  i wish i could have seen melissa, who is also in vermont with him.  you can check out some of their design work at the snowflake factory...i've linked it.  also, look out for bosque brown...  pedro the lion has a new ep with some different versions of previously released material and three cover songs: randy newman, cat power, and radiohead.  6 songs 6 bucks.  several months ago we got two new dell computers here at the body shop.  the keyboards were wrapped in this plastic that had a little "no suffocating" logo/character that looked an awful lot like strong sad.  so, believing it to be a warning for strong bad not to suffocate his little brother if he ever got a new computer wrapped in plastic like ours, we sent it off to see if they would find it as amusing as we did.  a couple weeks ago we got a letter from HomestarRunner.com  P.O. Box 888421  Atlanta, GA 30356.  it reads as follows:   Dear Center City Gang,  Thank you for your interest in Homestar Runner.  We love to hear from our fans.  We are sending you some freebies just to show how much we appreciate you.  Have a great summer and continue to look for new things from the Homestar Runner Gang.  Thank you for taking the time to write us.  Strong Bad will be reminded that Strong Sad is not to be suffocated.  He will just have to find some other means of mistreatment.  Sincerely, The Homestar Gang   enclosed were strong bad stickers for everyone at the shop.  we want to get the letter framed so we can proudly display it.

      this was taken from  urlLink funderstanding.com :  "Internalization refers to the process of learning--and thereby internalizing--a rich body of knowledge and tools of thought that first exist outside the child. This happens primarily through language."  i'm reading this stuff for my teacher course work and it's proving to be really insightful in relation to some internal dialogue i've been having about how God communicates.  also reading dallas willard's  Hearing God , which is amazing so far.  i can't really articulate much now, but hopefully in time...  more later.

      1 week of jr. high camp + 1 bacteria-infested cabin - my vitamins + a 10 mile hike in the great smoky mountians in less than 4 hours - needed rest + hike with dad around chimney rock = sick ryan. thankfully it was short and i am fast on the mend, though i wish i could have hung out with my dad for longer.  the smoky mountains are awesome. and the national park is completely free! i hiked a trail called "alum caves bluff." it was 2.2 miles following a creek and leading to some bluffs and then 2.8 more up to the peak of mount le conte (6,593 ft.). i want to visit as many national parks as i can in my lifetime. on the list: joshua tree, yosemite, glacier... maybe one summer i'll just live out of my car and a tent and see as many as i can.
