       I just had a thought that would make everything fit together!! I have indeed figured out where we come from, though how 42 fits into it... I am still working on that.  Heres the quick run-down untill I have time to forumlate a full theory.  Scientists say we evolved from Monkies, etc...  Creationists say we were made in Gods image...  Now, in the bible there are 'gaps of time' that could account for long periods of 'evolution' present in science.  Ok, taken that, and what we read and have been taught/know et al...   WHAT IF...  God was a monkey? I don't mean that in a sacrelgious way... not at all, but ... hmmm I think I am on to something here, more research required.    -intX    The tree that Eve snacked on was really banana!

       If you are interetested in programming and you are interested in free stuff then you just might want to look at  urlLink this . Basically, just watch five movies and rate them and MS will send you a free, not-for-resale, copy of VB.NET 2003. This worked out good for me since i have VB.Net but not the 2003 version.  So whatta ya say, even if you don't program go do it and get a copy and learn yourself something.   -intX    a free-for-all, fuck 'em all!

       So yesterday I woke up to a swolen face. Not completely swollen, but like my sinus areas and my upper lip like I had been punched. There was no real pain other than pressure. It did make me a little disortientated. I think it was just more freaky than anything. I called my doctor firt thing but either they hadn't got in to the office yet or they were just swamped with other calls.  Anyhoo, they called me back and told me to take some benedryl (even though I am on zyrtek...) so I did. I guess allergies was all it was afterall. I zonked out and woke up feeling a little bit better and 'The Burbs' was on. I opened my eyes just in time to see him cut the power wire and fall into the shed. Good stuff.  I'm feeling much better today, though, ever since yesterday my sense of smell has been noticably better or something.  I had something to post on about VB.Net but now cannot, for the life of me, remember what it was. Well, if I think of it I will post later.     -intX    Rock'n'roll with all my friends, hopin' the music never ends.

       Ran across  urlLink this article  earlier which reports on a couple of guys that found and recorded locations of quite a few motion sensors scattered about the desert around the "Area 51" base location. Supposedly agents and officers of the FBI and Air Force didn't much care for the snooping going on.  I like to think they have a Stargate [ urlLink image ] in there!

       Well, it's Monday... yeah. I'm pretty beat, I've been going and going all weekend. Saturday I went out to the gun range for a while before I needed to get back into town to go to A Perfect Circle concert. The show was awsome. They were just as good as, maybe better than, when I saw them back around six months ago in Tampa. Needless to say, the concert tired me out, but I wasn't done yet for the night.   After the show we went downtown to say happy birthday to Bill. He got a pink fanny pack and pink party hats. Good times. Had a couple beers there and whatnot then headed home to get some sleep. The problem is I ended up plopping down on the couch and found a cheesy movie to watch that kept me up till 4am or so.  The next day I decided to sleep in a little and not go to the gun range as was planned the previous day. I was just too tired. But around 2 or so my friend insisted so we go out to do some skeet shooting and target practice so out we go. While we were out there, I somehow tore a muscle in my shoulder and it didn't help that I was shooting a semi-auto 12g shotgun either. Also I managed to get a shard of something in my left index finger and dehydrated myself while I was out there.  So in other words, "ouch". I might have more interesting stuff later.    -intX    I've fallen, and I can't get up...

        urlLink This article  talks about the chance of a Privacy Czar. This person is to oversee, as you would assume, privacy issues. It talks about not only creating this one position but several other positions under the "czar" which manage the different government departments. Hopefully this new position is added and the Patriot Act and, to an extent, the DMCA can be put into check. (One can only hope.)  I had a dream last night, I went to the moon, or maybe it was Mars, I know it was an extraterrestrial body of some sort. Anyhoo, for some reason we were up there tossing a football around in the lower gravity. We got some damned good distance with it too. I remember heading back to earth and remembering that I had neglected to pick up some rock samples as souvineers for my friends back home, so when I got back I called up some friends and we went zooming through space yet again.

       Most of you know my general stance on censorship, I fucking hate it. There, if you didnt know before, now you do. The reason I hate it is not that it shields people from something they would rather not be exposed to but that it forces that shielding upon everyone, no exceptions. With that in mind I totally (heart) the ratings guides.  The ratings: G, PG, PG-13, NC-17, R, et al... as well as the entire video game ratings from the ESRB and such. Great idea, I love them. The question remains tho, why do we need censorship when we have ratings? I'll tell you my take on this.  Parents do not want the job of parenting. There is the summed up bulk of it all right there. Noone wants responsability. It's always someone elses fault that their kid is screwed up, never their own. Granted, there are exceptions as there are for many rules, but to blame a generation of fuckups problems on TV, video games and movies... that is absurd.  According to the First Amendment of the United States  urlLink Bill of Rights :    Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.    Now according to the  urlLink FCC :   The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent United States government agency, directly responsible to Congress. The FCC was established by the Communications Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable. The FCC's jurisdiction covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. possessions.    OK, so we find out that the FCC is established by the  urlLink Communications Act of 1934 . You can read that yourself, it's in PDF format and I didn't feel like typing a bunch of stuff.  The point is, nowhere in any of these documents have I been able to find information granting the FCC the power to censor what is broadcasted. From my understanding, and please I want someone to prove me wrong, the FCC is only in charge of regulating fair use and charges associated with the different forms of telecomunications.  My view on censorship is basically, if you are easily offended, stay away from the stuff that offends you or learn to deal with it. The world is full of offensive stuff and having someone shield you from it does nothing to help you other than to help you hide from the world. To tie the ratings system in, if everythign was "rated" and everyone could find out before hand the "rating" on something they could choose not to watch it. If, with the rating in place and censorship out of the picture, the program/broadcast somehow exceedes its rating, at that point it should be fined based on severity alone.  Anyway, I'm done typing now. bye.    -intX    guns don't kill people, they just shoot hot projectiles at them

       So there I was, yesterday morning, ready to go to work when as soon as I get out of bed I notice I have a pounding headache and a sore throat. These things don't normally bother me since it's usually just one of those things that happens when one wakes up out of some deep mouth-breathing sleep session. I hopped in the shower hoping the steam would revive me. I was wrong.  I ended up calling in sick and stayed home. I poked around on my PC for about an hour laying out the finishing touches for my essay saved that and uploaded it so I could print it later. Then I made it a point to go lay down, at which time I fell back asleep untill around 4pm. I felt like such a bum for it, but oh well that's that.  Maybe I should work a little harder on obtaining a new girlfriend. I had pretty much forsaken relationships for a while when out of nowhere I started seeing this girl, problem was the same thing happened again that had originally forced me to swear off dating. Now I have that itch again. Something deep inside is telling me I should go for it, I should just go out there and get ground into the pavement again. I think it's also telling me I should run with scissors too so I don't really know what to make of it.  Done with that babbling, I picked up "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" season 1 the other day and have thoroughly enjoyed that. I also picked up an old classic,  urlLink "Disgaea: Hour of Darkness"  for the PS2. This game is brilliant and I would reccommend it to anyone, that is... anyone who is into brilliant games. If you aren't, well, this one isn't for you... go play Poke`mon or something.  At first this may seem like some sugar coated cutesy game, but as you play it the story really developes into some twisted shit. Let's just explain a few things you play as  urlLink Laharl , a psychotic and dimented kid and only son of Krichevskoy the king of the Netherworld. Basically, you are a demon prince. Your direct subordinate is a little cutesy demoness named  urlLink Etna , though she is loyal to you, she sometimes freaks out and has temper tantrums. You're goal in this game is to basically overthrow this guy that has taken control of your, now deceiced, father's kingdom and destroy everyone in your way.     -intX    do a little dance...

       It appears that people who wish to have children have to perform this thing referred to as... "sex". I don't know about you but this is some earth-shattering news that has been laid upon me. Appearantly it is also news for  urlLink this couple . I'm glad I found out now instead of when I decided to start a family. I mean, I can barely imagine the anger these people must feel having tried fo so long and in so many different positions: Sitting on wooden chairs, standing on stepping stools, riding a marry-go-round. All of these seem like wonderfull ways to conceive a child, but I guess it just doesn't work that way.

       In the  urlLink article  I just read is a statement by former Congressman Allan Swift on the way the DMCA SHOULD be. He has been making home copies of T.V. programs, singles from cassettes and CDs. He even gives these compilations out to his friends, but he never charges money, not even the cost of the media he puts it on.  I think a quote from him pretty much sums it all up:    When I buy a CD or a DVD, that content should be wholly mine to do with as I please as long as I am in no way selling its contents or profiting from it. ... Present law is predicated on the assumption that consumers will rip-off copyright holders. The vast majority are innocent of that assumption, but all are treated as guilty.     -intX    keepin' it real in the 'hood

       As the title may implay to some of you, this posting is more or less just a status update on things I am working on, such as essays for class and software I am writing. Not a major update I guess, but as I have yet to look around for something good to write about I figured I might as well do something.  To start with, as a few of you may know, I have started back at college. I'm on my second week of a six week, three credit class. To my surprise I actually like being back in school. Well this class currently has me working on one essay and a longer-term essay. The essay is a process essay discussing the Rational Unified Process (RUP). Basically, this is a general process by which software is planned and designed.  The research project is an argumentive paper discussing the problems with the DMCA such as how it prevents researchers, programmers along with many others from reverse engineering, circumventing security and/or finding holes in software and reporting or publishing papers on such research if they do decide to do it anyway. Several people have so far served cease and decist orders, arrested, charged and extridited under the broad blanket statements of the DMCA.  I'm also making some progress on a program I am working on in my free time (like I have any). I've been getting a lot of it reorganized here and there and some new parts written. I'm about to get to the point where I need to start working on the printing interface for it.  Well, that's about all I got for now. I'll probably post more later on when I get a chance.    -intX    stab stab stab!

       Not to get all "Dear Diary" on you but I had a dream last night that was rather strange. I don't remember the whole thing, but I do recall parts of it.  I was back in my old neighborhood where I grew up and was at my neighbors house. Somehow I had my left forearm replaced with a synthetic/mechanical arm. It must have been a new addition because there were still stitches and it was sore. I also had a remote controled truck of some kind. It was a full sized vehicle but I could controle it with an arm mounted remote, kinda like K.I.T. needless to say it was pretty fucking rad. Pretty fucking rad that is, until my friend started messing with the controls and it crashed into another neighbors house and took out part of a wall. I back the vehicle up into a garage and closed it and we ran inside before anyone noticed.  Once inside it was like our old neighborhood get-togethers. All of our parents were there, the grill was going and it seemed like a good time. The next thing I remember was that I was lost in a strange house that had a T.V. in every room, I was trying each one, looking for anything except static, I think the static was causing my robotic arm to act up and I couldn't control it efficiently.  I think this is where I woke up. I know there was more to the dream but I just can't remember it. It's strange, I have been having very vivid and outright strange dreams the past week or so and I rather enjoy it.  In other news, I have decided on the topic for my research paper. I am going to write about the downfalls of the DMCA. It is an argumentive essay so I will be arguing that the DMCA does more harm than good and that it should be drasticly altered or done away with. Depending upon how it comes out I might look at publishing it. Also, if I enjoy writing this essay as much as I believe I will, I think I might write another on the problems with the Patriot Act and how it steps on the rights of individuals.  On a scientific note, I'de like to point you to  urlLink this article  I saw on slashdot about David Deutsch's experiment which, as he describes it, shows proof of a parallel universe. He also gives instructions on how you can test this at home with a laser pointer, a pin and a piece of white paper.  The parallel universe he describes sounds like some evil, negative, shadow universe where an exact copy of yourself exists, except with an opposite moral allignment. If you ask me, I think that's pretty bad-ass. I would caution against taking this article for fact though. I might take some time and do some more research about this, though I have done a lot of reading and research on quantumn theory and what he is proposing does, actually, make some sense.    -intX    randome phrase

       A  urlLink friend  pointed me to  urlLink this article . Now, I had heard about this supposed  urlLink DMCRA  which is meant to "fix" some  urlLink things that were wrong  with the  urlLink DMCA , so this doesn't come as total news, but I'm glad to see people are starting to take notice of this.   Ok, I realize I have given you a lot of links to read over, but this is kind of important to me. I am glad that this issue is finally being addressed. Too many companies have brandished the DMCA at anyone they deem "evil" (which in most cases, translates to people like me, and probably you, that like to figure things out or possibly write our own software to emulate another program). In my opinion, and in the opinions of others, the DMCA was a knee-jerk reaction to events and concepts that were not understood by the people that made the law. The DMCA greatly cripples the ability to legitimately explore software and hardware. It gives companies the power to file legal action against individual researchers giving reports of vulnerabilities. It also gives companies the ability to extradite foreigners who reverse engineer their products or security features, even if it was done for personal "fair-use".  From what the article says however, it doesn't look like this proposal will get too far. Butch Otter (R-Idaho) looked down on it saying, "Theft is theft and property is property".  Hey Butch, no shit, I'm glad you explained that in such a way that my simple mind could comprehend it. The problem is, Butch, the DMCA doesn't just stop thieves from thieving property, it stops legitimate researchers from doing anything more than sticking their collective thumbs up their collective asses. Without research, Butch, we cannot innovate, and without innovation we cannot progress as a society.  I think that about covers my thoughts at the moment, I might comment further in a little while.    -intX    hug the duck

       I have often had dreams of the future. A place where we humans may one day be physically enhanced by machines. A place where I could rule with, literally, an iron fist. Since I have fond thoughts of this 'future' thing, I thought it appropriate that I should mention  urlLink this article . Give it a quick scan over, maybe read some bits here and there then come back here and finish up with what I am babbling on about.  Imagine if you will, the ability to switch your vision to the infrared light spectrum at will. Viewing over-lay diagrams of something you are working on, perhaps your cars engine. Maybe you wish to have notes for your presentation lightly scrolled in your periphrial vision. This is all  urlLink a lot closer  than most people would think. In the link right back there it talks about head mounted 'glasses' which reflect low-powered lasers onto the users retina displaying virtually any image provided to it.  With enhanced vision not too far off we are that much closer to my robotic future, but we need something more. We need strength enhancements,  urlLink no problem , this is being worked on already. I haven't quite decided if I would get a couple limbs lopped off yet, but I would abso-fucking-lutly go for an exo-skeleton type frame connected directly to my brain.  I can imagine, however, that with all these robotic implants it would make air travel a little more irritating. I wonder if there would be any exceptions or special planes that cyborgs would fly... Shit, i may just get rocket boosters attached to my mechanical body and fly myself wherever the hell I wanted to go.  Of course this would, more than likely, lead to a war between the humans and the cyborgs. The humans would start it by trying to revoke our freedoms and rights claiming that we were no longer self-aware or that we were a threat. In the end the cyborgs would crush the human opposition and we would expand to other planets and travel the galaxy waging wars with any who stand in our way.  I guess that's it for now, just something I was thinking about.   -intX    ...and your point is?

It actually seems like this class will be pretty easy. I don't know if it's just because I have had such a long break or if it's because I'm just a little older and a little wiser.  I need to pick a topic for my research paper. I think I'll go with "Censorship In America, More Harm Than Good". I really dislike censorship, I think ratings are a great idea, but not manditory censorship. If you don't like it, DON'T FUCKING LOOK AT IT YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKER. ...I might include that in my research paper. ^_^  Got quite a bit done on my application last night. Reorganized the classes and did some much needed commenting. =) I still think I need to rewrite the search functionality of it.

       Huzzah, first blog post here. Well, what can I say?  I start back at college today. in fact, in about two hours I will be on campus. I've decided to finish off my degree after taking a short "break" 5 years ago... Oh well, it will be good to get back into it. I think I will go for my CS degree, I was originally going for an AA but quickly realized that it was not something I wanted to waste my time on when I could be working. I don't regret it, I got a good start on my career even without college.  On to a different subject, I am working on a .Net application. It is basically just a image viewer/thumbnail browser. The big deal with it is its built in search functionality and print queueing. I would carefully estimate that I have about 70% of the core programming done. After I finish that up I'll move on to some hardcore testing and kicking the crap out of it. I have one tester lined up, a photographer who has gotten into the digital imaging scene and the, what I call, photo-on-demand market. That is what this application is aimed for.

         This has allowed us to develop a complete manned space program from scratch for the price of one of those government paper studies, I’m so proud of that it brings tears to my eyes, it really does   (Rutan)  Just think, today could be the day that the first privately funded vehicle makes it out of our atmosphere on its own. "June 21, 2004" the history books will read, "was the day Scaled Composites showed to the world that it was time for humanity to make its move into space." This will also signify that the governments around the world need to wake up and take things a little more seriously.   Some people would argue that we do not need to go into space, that we still have oceans to explore here. I would say they were correct; however, it is not the fact that we do not need to go into space, it is what we learn by attempting these things that gets us further. I would estimate a good 85% of what we use daily was developed durring or for missions into space.  Anyhoo, good luck Scaled Composites.    -intX    Warp Seven! ENGAGE!

I may one day just do this myself, but I wan't to make sure I either do it first, at the same time, or not at all.  Here's my plan:  Have my mouth physically stitched shut in the morning before sunrise. Stick a set of horse blinders on my head and put on some earmuffs. Position myself in front of one of the main buildings in D.C. and hold a sign that reads "I had a better sign, but it got censored." and on the back "I'de be more controversial, but then I wouln't make the news."  Spend a day out there, yes that means no water, no food and probably pissing yourself. It would be worth it though. I just need to go do it now. It only took a single man to stop a tank...      -intX    This phrase has been censored by the U.S. government.

        urlLink fucking link!   Goddmanit, as if the DMCA wasn't bad enough. First they decide to throw a piece of crap like that into legislation. Now we got some jack-off senator aiming to toss another monkey-wrench in the gears of innovation and personal freedom.  A hardy 'fuck you sir' goes out to  urlLink Sen. Orrin Hatch  (R-UT) for his wonderfull work toward a safer world full of lawsuits over meaningless crap. Way to clog the system buddy.  Well, now that I have that out of my system I think I can enjoy my weekend calculating how long we have until Skynet or Big Brother come in to the picture.  Have a good weekend you mindless dumbfucks.   -intX    Omnia mutandur nos et mutamur in illis

       Well, I ended up getting a 98 on my final research paper. The 2 points I lost were from indenting the first line of my blockquotes. I indented all of the blockquote like normal, but I also indented the first line as you would for a new paragraph. Pretty lame thing to lose 2 points on. =/ I mean, at least I was consistant in it.  I believe I also did quite well on the final exam, which was 60 questions and an in-class essay about frequent testing in classes bleh.   So yeah...    -intX    blasphemy

        urlLink link   Above is a link to an ebay auction. This person is selling TONS of video game hardware and software. From NeoGeo to X-Box this guy is selling a huge package deal.

       So there I was...  (You can always tell a good story when it starts off with "So there I was...")  So there I was, sitting at my desk putting some finishing touches on a report I was writing in FoxPro (yeah, *cringe*), and I think to myself "Self, this needs to be compiled and tested. - You are absolutly right self!" So I begin to compile the program which contains the report, the one which I had mentioned earlier. Things go fine, then a couple errors crop up that keep me from proceeding. You see, this isn't all together strange, we work in a multi-user environment so all of our code is stored in a source control, usually when this happens it just means you maybe havent added, removed or updated some files; no problem.  (If you watch closely this is the part where my morning becomes... not so happy and fuzzy and stuff... as if it were before. Well, it was, to some extent, a bit more on the cheerfull side... but I digress.)  So I was deleting a couple files and I guess I just got on a delete spree for some reason and clicked on the report I had just written (I am currently blaming the fingers but the fingers keep pointing in other directions). As I looked this file dead in the eyes (or... whatever form of ocular organ a file may have) my finger swiftly and deliberately pounced upon the delete key. Immediately I realized what I had done when the confirmation dialog box popped up.   "Do you want to: [Remove] [Delete] [Cancel] ?" it enquired.  "Interesting choices, though I really don't want to delete this file. This is the one I have been working on." I said to myself as I clicked directly on the button marked "[Delete]".  The dialog box left in much the fashion that it appeared. I could feel my brow do a summersault and land in a half furrow, half questioning position. My eyes blinked of their own accord for a moment and then my hand joined in the fun and smacked both of them just for the hell of it, it made sure to include my nose just to make sure my mouth would be upset. Obviously it was quite upset, as it immediately let go of my jaw and muttered a few curse words.  Needless to say I will be spending the rest of the morning rewriting that report and hoping I do not delete it a second time.     -intX    Bottles and cans, just clap your hands

         Dear Nintendo,  I noticed that you have recently started your NES Classic campaign whereby you are bringing back such hits as The Legend of Zelda and Donkey Kong as well as a fanny pack full of other greats. While I applaud you for re-introducing today's youth to the revolutionary ideas and game concepts I cannot help but see this as nothing more than a way to rake in some fast cash by whoring out poor Link and Mario, two of your greatest champions. I certainly hope I am wrong in this, believe me, I do.      urlLink Link to IGN   Anyhoo, that is about how a letter from me to  urlLink Nintendo  would go. As you can tell, I have sorta mixed feelings on the whole situation. On one hand I am glad to see the classics getting out there on a newer system that today's children will possibly buy and find as much entertainment in as we did back in our youth. On the other hand, releasing each one sepperately for $20 each seems like more of a way to bring in extra cash. I think I would have been a little more happy about this had there been, I don't know, 3 or so games on one cart.  I read a  urlLink review  which covers Super Mario Brothers and The Legend of Zelda. The reviewer lost some credibility when he mentioned "The game has been given the same treatment as Super Mario Bros., with a gray cartridge and all". Now, I would like you to take a look at the last part of that sentence. The reviewer mentions earlier in his review that the SMB cart matched the old NES game, however the Zelda game was, in-fact, gold. They possibly did come out later with a grey one, but I have yet to see one.  I digress as I jst wanted to point out that the "new" classic NES games you may or may not choose to purchase are, in fact, out there for consumption. I MAY break down and buy one or two. If I do it will be Legend of Zelda for sure, and if I find out that there is a Kid Icarus coming I will definately have to purchase that one.  The thing is, however, I do still have a working NES attached to my living room television. I also still have Kid Icarus, Zelda (I & II), SMB 1,2, and 3 and just about any other classic NES game anyone would ever want to play (including Gauntlet, "Blue elf needs food badly").  Well, that about summs things up for the time being.    -intX    Justin Bailey

       If you haven't heard of it yet, please check the  urlLink Monolith  project. The premise of this project is that it combines two files to create a third completely different file with a .mono extension.  See it works like this...  Let's say you have:   Metallica-Master_of_Puppets.mp3  And you create a text file with enough characters to make the files the same size. We'll call this file, junk.txt groovy? groovy.  Now Monolith will take the two files and "munge" them together. You now have a file called munge.mono or something similar. The contents of this file are neither of the original files, yet they are both of the original files. (mmm quantum states...) Anyhoo, this new file is not, nor can it be copyrighted, and therefore is free to be distributed since none of the data contained has anything to do with the copyrighted Metallica song.  The nifty part is, what a person does with this file is totally up to them. They could for instance get a copy of your junk.txt file and extract "Master of Puppets" from it, but ONLY with an exact copy of junk.txt in this particular case. To bring this all together junk.txt is not a copyrighted file is it? Nope, we just made it... I guess you could go TRY to copyright it but that is neither here nor there. Avoiding further digression, junk.txt is free to distribute right along side your munge.mono. When the person you send this to gets the files he/she can run their Monolith and combine the junk.txt and the munge.mono files to pull out the Metallica-Mater_of_Puppets.mp3 file. Of course their ownership of that file is subject to scrutiny but the trasferring of data cannot be considered criminal, since the data transmitted has absolutely no copyrighted content within it.    -intX    UNO!

       Did some catching up on some of the usual reading I do and came across  urlLink this article  discussing virii and the people that write them. Basically saying how difficult it is to actually track the writers down. This article then goes into mentioning WiFi and how it opens up a whole new attack point for virus writers.   urlLink This  has been spotted in several places and has thus been reported by these places. I decided to give you the  urlLink BBC  version. It seems that companies have been selling off hard drives on eBay. Cool, companies recouperating losses to an extent... well, the not-so-cool part of it is that these drives contain residual data. Even though companies and individuals may think they have cleaned their storage devices residual data can still leave a magnetic imprint. The article gives a few suggestions to avoid this problem such as encryption and access control procedures. In the past I wrote scripts that would rewrite file contents with random characters tothe exact byte-size as the former file. Then it would rename each file to a random string, also of the same length, then delete these files (or format, fdisk, format on the particular partition). Sure it can be a lengthy process, but having a script that performs most of it helps greatly. An honestly, if the data is sensitive you should be going out of your way to clean it up whether it be personal or business.  Finally, if  urlLink this  is true you will have to excuse me while I sit here and shake my head in dissapointment. Land of the free and home of the brave my ass. I love watching our rights fade away on a daily basis.    -intX    We control the horizontal

       I just got done reading an interesting  urlLink article  in which Declan McCullagh raises the question (which I have been raising for quite some time now) of "[is it] time to abolish the Federal Communications Commission"?  He brings up several good points. But only barely touches on the main point which I use in my arguments, censorship. He mentions Howard Stern and Jannet Jackson's nipple. This falls under the category of censorship. The FCC was originally a good idea, however times change and because of that fact, we need to change as well.  As you may have read in some of my other posts, I have found nowhere that the FCC has the power to censor. In fact, that is an impedement of our First Amendement: The freedom of speech and of the press.  Well, you just think about that today as you hear your lyrics bleeped off of the radio, or see a nipple blurred off of your favorite movie. Maybe you can think about it while you're reading the morning paper and get the feeling you are missing out on some facts.    -intX    omnia mutantur nos et mutamur in illis

       As the title may suggest I am currently listening to Ænema off of Tool's album Ænima. This has always been, by far, one of my favorite songs from them. Tool in general has always been one of my favorite bands. I believe nothing more needs to be said about this subject since it is obvious that I have covered all there is to be said. =)  If you haven't figured it out by now, it is in fact Friday. I will only be working a half-day today as I have a doctors appointment later on and I needed to get a few things done while I was at it. I've got a real craving for sushi right now, and quite possibly a bottle of sake could accompany the meal to result in a well rounded meal and a warm fuzzy mood.  I've noticed a few new people have actually stopped by. Not only have they stopped by, but they actually posted. Aren't I the popular one? Ok, so maybe I'm not *that* popular, but hey, it gets me through the day.  Sorry I don't really have news right now. I've been busy at work and just didn't have time this morning before I came in to the office. Speaking of the office, we are trying to decide which language we should migrate to when we do our big systems re-write. So far it looks like the majority are leaning to C#. The other main choice was VB.Net. I think either would be fine honestly. The languages in the .Net framework all compile down to basically the same thing so there really isn't much in the way of performance. Several quarks have been pointed out to me in VB.Net that I never noticed. I would probably ellaborate on it however, I don't see why most of the people reading this would even care. =p  My Comp class is almost finished. Summer A session is being a real bastard. We've had 1k word essays due each week. I have one small essay due tuesday discussing opposition to my argumentive research paper. I need to follow that with a rough draft of my paper on Thursday and then turn in my final the following Tuesday. That thursday we receive the papers back and take the final exam. So I am almost done... *phew*.  I'll see about digging up some interesting news, in the meantime, consider joining me and many others at the  urlLink Warped Tour  in Tampa, July 30.

         urlLink Space.com  is reporting on  urlLink Scaled Composite's  SpaceShipOne, the privately sponsored craft that is on it's way into history as the first non-government vehicle to reach sub orbital altitudes and earn it's pilot his astronaut wings.

       I seem to be a hub of advice. It has been this way for some time now. I have never understood it fully. I mean, I listen to the advice I give, but I rarely follow it. Well, that is, if I have not already experienced it. I don't know if it is a gift or a curse. People tell me constantly that I anticipate their thoughts and I do admit to that. At the same time I seem to be, as one would describe, an absentminded professor.  I think back on my life in a sort of fast-forward review of events leading me to my present position in the space-time continuum. I am happy about one thing over everything else. I have given myself to experience. I try not to take someones word on things, be it good or bad. I've hurt myself plenty of times. I've even hurt others, and by hurt I mean physically and/or emptionally. I don't appologize for any of it, it's life. That has lead me to conclude that life is meant to be lived, lived with no regrets. Obviously you need to moderate your activities and minimize negative influences on others, but often that cannot be avoided.   This brings up another thought. People, in general, appologize for far too many things. At times they appologize for events that are well out of their control. We also tend to over-use other words and phrases, such as 'love' and 'hate'. I am not saying I am innocent of this, but I do try to watch my careless usage of such words. I admit, however, that it is hard in fits of excitement to check every word. Once I began thinking about this subject years ago I started noticing more and more people using these words in completely wrong contexts. Then again, who am I to say what is right or wrong, such things are subjective.  I recently read an inteview with Maynard from Tool, one metaphore he used to describe knowledge and information is this:   "If you look at the cycles of the moon, it starts as a thin crescent and then gradually waxes until it becomes full; then it gradually wanes back into another crescent and then it is gone. The moon reflects sunlight like humans reflect information. We wax and wane and when we become full moons, our egos are full.   I think he hit it dead on. We should not take credit for information. The information was always there, we didn't create it. However, interpretation is something to be proud of. Sharing knowledge I learn with others is one thing that really makes me happy. To inform someone of something they did not know before. Sometimes I think I should be a teacher or a historian. I very much enjoy ancient history and learning of cultures that were pondering the same questions we have still today.  I've recently been thinking about looking for a new female companion. The last two times I ventured this i got burned. Maybe I'll just poke my head out of the treeline and see how things are going out there these days. It's not insecurity, nor is it fear. Some might call it hesitation, but I don't think that would fit either, if anything I am not hesitant (for the most part) in fact most of the time I am quite the opposite - "shoot first ask questions later", "going both feet in", etc. Maybe I would call it, cautious I guess. Yes, that works.  Anyhoo, I'm pretty much done rambling. Mynext post, I promise, will be something back in line with the standard dork-factor, which is normally present here.   -intX    what, me wory?
