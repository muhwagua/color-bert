       Well where to begin...  I think I will begin with one of my first memories as a child. I remember sitting on some type counter and all these girls looking at me. My sister was there and there was feathered hair all over the place. I knew we were at my sister's high school in the V building. Denise's friend were making a big fuss over me (why because I was a QT of course). For some reason I remember all of the girls wearing a deep maroon or it may have been red. I think they were all mat maids or uncoordinated cheer leaders. Well I think that is where I will stop for now. I know it isn't much but I will continue on little exercises as my blog progresses.  caio!

       Me:  I'm not as bright as you. I'm one of the dull crayons  My friend:  hardly.  Me:  I'm a broken crayon and you’re a freshly wrapped crayon.  My friend:  I'm one of those big fat ones for little kids  Me:  with a perfect point?  My friend:  yes! brand spanking new  Me:   I'm in the broken crayon bin. We hope to see the light of day sometime. I'm with the crayons that get melted into some ugly arts and crafts project.  My friend:  rofl  Me:  Oooh I am one of those flesh tone crayons. Nobody used those. I'll write an auotbiography called: "My life as a crayon: tearin' back the label" or "Broken and lovin' it"  My friend:  haaaaaaaaaaa! yessssssss!

       Happy Halloween!   Well I have received some great feedback on the costume. When I have pics available I most certainly will put them up.  I am going to stop by Charles' work. He didn't pick a costume.  Slacker!!!

       Costume Status   I am 99.9% complete with my costume. I painted my sweater and tie maroon and gold (Gryffindor).  I sewed latches on my cape. I also sewed the Gryffindor emblem on the cape. I'm wearing my black slacks and black shoes. I have the white button up shirt to wear with the tie and sweater. What's left you ask? Well I forgot my wand. I didn't get a wand. How could I forget? Maybe tonight I could put something together. We shall see...

       Ready for the weekend    I need some time to actually rest. I have caught a little cold that is slightly annoying. I just don't want it to turn into a hinderance. Well tonight I am going to a wake. My tata's sister passed away. I knew her as Tia Annie. It isn't pronounced like you would normally pronounce Annie. It sounds more like On-knee. I loved going to her house. She lived right by Davis Elementary and there were train tracks. I loved putting pennies on the track and waiting for the train and then after the train had passed we (my cousins and I) would run to the track and look for our freshly squashed penny. It was the best. She was one of the nicest people. I pray that God gives the family peace because I know my Tata is taking it really hard. I hope that this will bring our family even closer. There are so many relatives that I don't know. I am sure that I will meet some tonight.

       Long time no talk    Here is a quick recap of what I did this past weekend: Saturday  Class was pretty easy. I just have to email the instructor the last assignment  He came out great! My sister did some major makeup on the guy. For more pics look at  urlLink Operation Zelda   I didn't go to my Uncle's b-day party. I wasn't feeling too good and I wanted to spend some time at my mom and dad's so Charles and I  stayed there and watched a movie.    Sunday  I worked on my costume some more. It is coming together... slowly but surely.  I took many a pictures of the party. I will post my favorite pics later

        Busy as a bee...    Yup I have actually been busy. I know it is hard to believe. I learned how to crochet. I am putting together a Hogwart's student costume. I went to Toys R Us with AM to look for gifts for Asia. After TRU we picked up Asia from school. Then we went back to my mom's house. Dropper off Asia and picked up my mom. Went to Wal-Mart and picked up a DVD (Truth About Cats & Dogs) and some other stuff. AM got a head start on Christmas for Abram and Asia. Went back to my mom's house. Took some left over pizza (earlier from the day) and took it home to Chalres. I then put on the Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets (for motivation) and sat through the whole movie crocheting my scarf for my costume. I then went to bed about 11:30. It has been kind of hectic...

        My thoughts about Kill Bill    Well Charles and I went to see two movies this weekend. On Friday we went to see Kill Bill Volume 1 and on Saturday we saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Both were good movies.               -- urlLink    Kill Bill     --             This is the first part of two series and it left me wanting to see more. The action scenes were great. The costumes were good. The plot was simple. My favorite part of the movie was where O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and "The Bride" (Uma Thurman) fought out side of the club in the snow. It was just as if the snow falling was timed with the music. It was excellent. My favorite character was Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuritama). She was O-Ren Ishii's bodyguard. She was a bad mofo! I wish there was more of her in the movie.  There is always a least favorite character in the movie. In this one it would have to be Sofi Fatale (Julie Dreyfus). I can't put my finger on it but there was something about her that really annoyed me. I might have to watch it again just to find out  ;)

       AM's Lack of Short-Term Memory    So where to begin. I have so many examples at my disposal.  The exact times and dates of the events I can not recall (do I suffer from this as well?). But I think this will be a regular segment of my blog. Going forward it will be called AM's STM.  Example 1 -- Last week AM was looking for a costume for my niece Asia. She found a Yoda and I told AM, my sister, that she needs something brown to wear underneath. I proceeded to give her several examples such as a t-shirt or a sweater. What does AM say? "How about a white turtleneck?"  My poor chuck...

       Back for more  Wow has it been over a month? I'm sorry I did try to start a blog at other sites but it didn't work out. I do however want to include a post from my journal I started at the other site because I think I should share it with you. Here it is:   There was a discussion today about the worst Halloween costumes you wore as a kid. I am embarrassed to say... I won.  You remember the California Raisin fad? Yes... it is true... I was a California Raisin. My costume consisted of black tights, white gloves, a black garbage bag and many wadded up newspapers. I will let you use your imagination on how this ended up. All I can remember is how much I had to use the restroom and if I took off the tie at the bottom all the papers would come off.

       Weekend Synopsis    Friday night Charles and I hung out and relaxed.    Saturday I did loads and loads of laundry. Then while Charles went to work, I met my mom at Gordo's for lunch. We were there for about an hour and a half just talking. It was nice. She said that she misses me. Awwww.  Later Charles and I went to my parent's house for a nice friendly game of Mexican Train. My mom is quite the competitor. She has the double 15 dominos set that take 3 hours to play through. Once we are over with the game she immediately wants to start over. Charles and I look at each other with bloodshot eyes (it was already midnight), but we played on.  Instead of starting at 15 we started on 6s. It was fun. My mom won.  After our long night, Charles and I slept in. My family came over and brought a bucket of chicken from KFC. My dad helped Charles turn on the heater. They left and Charles and I then headed over to Jenny's house. Mike and her just bought a new tv and needed help lifting it. We chatted for a bit and left to run some errands and then returned home. It was a great weekend.

       TGIF... It seems as the year draws to an end, the weeks go by faster. I swear it was just Friday. What are my plans for this weekend? Let me check my calendar... oh look NOTHING! I think Charles and I are just going to take it easy this weekend. Probably clean house and that's about it. I am sure Charles will have to work tomorrow.  Hopefully not too long. The only thing I have to look forward to is laundry. Our laundry basket runneth over. I didn't realize it had been so long since I last washed. I guess I should have realized it was bad when putting clothes in the leaning tower of laundry has become a game. How so you ask? I compare it to playing Jenga. For anyone who has lived under a rock, Jenga is a game of stacked pieces. The object is to remove a piece and add it back on the top without making the whole pile fall. That is how my laundry is right now. I remove a piece of clothing such as socks and skillfully add them to the pile of laundry and I get excited if I don't make the leaning tower of laundry topple over.  I celebrate my 'non-topple' silently in fear that Charles might catch on with my own little game.

       Last class tonight... Yup it's true. Tonight is the last week for Human Resources Management.  The instructor is actually pretty good. Ooh that reminds me I need to fill out the course evaluation.  I'm so glad there are no papers due this week. The only thing that will be due is the final and it was a piece of cake.  Next week I have off. Why you ask? Thanksgiving of course. Which reminds me... I have to cook a ham for next week. Last year when I was given 'ham duty' I resorted to a Honey Baked Ham.  It was quite tasty, but my Mom refuses to accept a Honey Baked Ham. She wants me to cook it myself.  ::gasp:: That is quite an undertaking.

       Baby Shower Stuff...  I'm starting to gather stuff for my sister's baby shower.  There are so many sites with information on it. I took a stab at the guest list and there are roughly 30-35 people total. I think my house can handle that... hopefully.

       Good deed for the day...   I'm not sure if you remember the movie  urlLink Teen Witch . It was a great 80's movie/musical. Come to find out that Molly shares the same love for this movie. I was able to find some samples of the songs and Molly was really excited and fowarded them to her sister.     Molly's sister:    YAYAYAYYYAAA    Molly's sister:    O JESUS I am DYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Molly's sister:    How can I ever thank you enough.    Molly:   it was all delisa's doing    Molly's sister:   Well, you give her a big stick figure high five for me, ok?

       Weekend Synopsis    Friday    Charles and I relaxed and watched movies.    Saturday    Went to Asia's soccer game (it was a tie game) and then to Peter Piper Pizza with her and the team.  Went to Walgreen's and picked up a gift bag for my cousin's first b-day. It was nice we hung out with Becky, Adrian, Tia Mary, Uncle Arnold, Ronnie, Melissa and Becky's parents. Her parents were making me laugh. They are a hoot. There was some kid riding around on a scooter and Becky's dad, Charles and I were absolutely mesmerized by this little scooter. Everytime we heard it we got excited and said things like 'Here it comes! Here it comes!', 'I think I see it'. Becky's dad stopped the kid and wanted to get the details about the bike. We were all under the impression that the bike holds like 150 pounds and goes about 20mph at top speed. Boy were we wrong. 500 pounds with a top speed of 40mph. WOW! The kid I'm sure was a little intimidated. I'm sure he couldn't have been older than 13-14 and here are 3 adults surrounding him like kids at an ice cream truck. After answering our questions he drove into the sunset.  Left the party to go grocery shopping and to Target.  Molly, Dina and Teddy came over. We played Pictionary, Mexican Train, and some other games. I learned that I can not play the game BS. I am absolutely horrible at it.  I think Molly won all the times we played. Molly stayed till about 11:30pm. Dina and Teddy left about midnight or so. I was so proud of how my dogs behaved. I was worried they would try to bite Molly. but after Pixie barked at her a few times and gave her a good introductory sniff, all was good. We had Raspberry Vodka and Lemonade. That is some good stuff but way too dangerous. Charles wasn't feeling well yesterday. Good Times!!     Sunday    Charles and I drove to Phoenix and picked up Jan (Charles' mom) at the airport. Then drove her to the Four Seasons in Scottsdale. It was a really nice place. I'm sure they sell timeshares. We ate lunch at a outdoor restaurant. I had Albondigas and Charles had Posole. Jan had a Diet Coke (she was eating later with her co-workers).  The Albondigas were good but it was 7 bucks for about a cup size of soup. After spending some time with her in the room, we then left and stopped at In/Out for some burgers and fries.    All in all I had a fun weekend.

       Honorary Member  I go to Molly's blog and I see:    The Club  Well, I think I made a boo boo. Last night, I told Delisa I thought she "looked like a chola" in her work ID photo. Then I quickly recanted with, "Oh I can't say that, can I? I'm not in the club."  Delisa, who takes EVERYTHING in stride, said, "Well I can make you an honorary member! Your code name will be 'La Guera!'" OUT-freeking-STANDING!   My response?  To correct your statement I actually said 'honorary beaner'.

       Weekend Synopsis  I went to Asia's game Saturday morning. After the game I took her and Abram to go eat. After eating, we went to the parking lot of a local mall and I was teaching Abram how to drive. It was fun and he did pretty good too. Saturday evening we saw two movies. Elf and Scary Movie 3.  Elf was great! Will Ferrill was awesome in this movie. Scary Movie 3 was awful. I really didn't want to see it however Charles wanted to see it. It was a 'double feature' night. We paid for Elf and saw Scary Movie 3 for free.  . When the movie was over and we were walking to the car, Charles quietly said "at least we didn't spend anything to see that movie". I should have said I did because I spent way too much time in that theatre.   Sunday I had to come to work to finish up on a project. Then went home and played some PS2. It was great.

       Pen Pal  I'm really excited. I received my packet yesterday about being a pen pal for kids in Washington DC. I have two assignments before I am given a group of pen pals.  The first is to write an introductory letter. The second is to create a visual profile. I think I will have to work on that later today.  Molly first introduced me to the in2books.org and I'm really looking forward to writing the letters. I've never had a pen pal and I think that this is a great opportunity to help kids. PLUS I spend way too much time playing PS2 and I was going to start volunteering anyway. Thanks for the lead Molly!

       Friday  Well I made it through another week.  School was good yesterday. Notice I didn't say great. It would have been great if Molly went but it was good. The teacher kept us til about 9:30pm. This teacher is holding my attention. In fact he has been throwing a wrench on Molly's ability to tell when I lose attention. How so? Well let me tell you. At the start of each class Molly will write down the time that she thinks I will lose my interest in the class lecture. Of course she doesn't show me the time. She has quite the ability for prognostication. So the deal is if I reach for something and start 'doodling' or grab for something in my backpack to keep me entertained the time is 'marked'.   She had it down to 2 minutes once...

She said that she included new scenes in the comic strip. Well hopefully I can get through the class.

       Voting  I am so bad. I completely forgot to vote yesterday. I had even read up on the current propositions and filled out the voter's brochure so I could take it with me. CRAP!!! I know this is bad I am admitting it to you but I have never voted before. I think that's why I was so gung-ho about voting this time around. I did my research too. I feel awful now.

Someone:  If people don't love me enough to use their credit cards, then they don't belong there.  Me:  Exactly.  Someone:  I'm glad we're on the same track.

       Frodo vs. Potter  So as you are aware I was a Hogwart's student in the Gryffindor House. For you muggles, that is from Harry Potter. I was really proud of my costume. Not only did I learn how to crochet and finish my first 6 foot scarf in less than a week, I also sewed on my latches and patch on my cape AND I painted my sweater trims to match the Gryffindor House colors (Maroon and Gold). I wanted to share my accomplishment with a friend at work, I shall call her Cheri ;-)  So I go to Cheri like a little kid all excited to share my creation. Imagine a 5 year old showing a freshly colored stick figure family portrait and the pride that goes with them sharing it. I am positive I had a cheesy smile that went from ear to ear. My friend Cheri goes..."Ooh Lord of the Rings". My smile immediately faded and I replied with disgust "ahhh..no". Needless to say I walked away feeling totally defeated by her lack of pop culture knowledge.

       The Last Samurai   This movie was great. To be perfectly honest I am not a big Tom Cruise fan but he was great in  urlLink The Last Samurai . Charles mentioned a few times during the movie "those are my brothers".  He had also mentioned that he now wants a samurai sword with his mom's maiden  name 'Watanabe'. I told him I can see him playing around with the sword and cutting off a major appendage. He said he promised he would be careful.

       Dinner and a movie   Last night Charles and I ate a Gavi's which I thought was spelled Gabe's.  Molly informed me that I was not spelling it correctly. If Gabe is pronounced in spanish it sounds the same as Gavi. Oh well...  The portions of food at  Gavi's  were hearty and dee-li-cious. I ordered lasagna, Charles ordered stuffed eggplant and for our appetizer we had creamy calamari. I have leftover lasagna for lunch. Yummy!   After dinner we met my parents, Denise and Abram at World Market (I think it is called Cost Plus). Abram had way too much flavored coffee from there. He was talking way too fast for me to understand. I had to keep reminding him to stay still around all the breakable items in the store. After the store we decided to go see The Last Samurai at Park Place (the mall). When we got to the mall we had about 20 minutes to spare before the movie started so we walked around a bit. I needed to get more lotion (Plumeria) from Bath & Body Works and Charles needed to go to KB Toys. Abram was still buzzing off his coffee in Bath & Body Works shop; he was actually jumping up and down. I lightly grabbed his chin and told him to settle down.  We met Charles in KB's and he found Star Wars figures. After he bought them we met my parents and Denise and went to the movies to see The Last Samurai.

       3 Years   Today Charles and I will celebrate our 3 year wedding anniversary. I can't believe it has already been 3 years. Charles showed up at work to hand deliver me flowers but I missed him. He gave me white roses which are my favorite. Such a great guy. We may go eat later tonight. We may eat at Caruso's which is my favorite restaurant.

       Weekend Synopsis    Friday... I can't even remember what I did Friday. Oh yeah. Charles and I went to the Casino. We played the penny machines and spent about $20. Not bad for a couple of hours.  We didn't win anything. Oh well.   Saturday... Charles and I cleaned house and then lounged around. We later got ready and then went to my mom's house and played some games. Afterwards we went to pick up Denise at the airport about 10pm. She looked so cute with her little mommy belly. After picking up Denise we went straight to Mi Nidito. She loves to eat there and wanted good Mexican food. Back at home (Missoula, MT) there isn't much Mexican food except Taco Bell.    Sunday... The baby shower was on Sunday. The food was great and we laughed a lot. It was fun. I took plenty of pictures. I will have to get them to Denise.

       Class Tonight   I have class tonight. Ugh. I haven't even started the paper. Ok so I did start the paper. I changed the standard cover sheet to the class name, the new instructor, and date. That's all! I will have to start working on it. Why do I always wait until the last minute? This is the last class that I have with Molly at the UofP. Awwww. Hopefully we will still take the Art History class at Pima. We shall see.

       Drive By Chocolate   Strange. I got back to my desk earlier and there was a big chocolate bar on my seat.  It is one of those fundraiser chocolates that was left at my desk.  I wonder who it is from? Maybe my secret santa. I don't want to sound rude but I am not much of a chocolate person. I know Charles will love it.  Wait a minute. What if it was left at my desk by mistake? Ok this is what I will do. I will leave it at my desk for the remainder of the week. It will be right by my keyboard. In case someone 'forgot' it. However when I leave on Friday it is going home with me and it will make Charles a happy man.

       Tuna Fried Rice   That's what we had for dinner yesterday. It is simple to make and it is yummy. Charles and I ate dinner, then we played poker.  We played Texas Hold Em, Follow the Queen, Baseball, Flying V, Low Ball, 7 card No-Peek, and plain old poker. While playing we watched Bubble Boy.  urlLink Bubble Boy  is an okay movie. There is this midget named Beetlejuice.  Charles thinks this midget is funniest thing in the world. Why?  I have no idea. I personally like the Bright and Shiny people (cult) and their leader is Gil played by Fabio. Like I said... an ok movie.

       Long Weekend Synopsis    As you know this past weekend was Thanksgiving.  Here is what I did on each day:  Thursday -- Woke up at 8 to start the ham. Yup that is right I did the ham. Pineapple, ground cloves, brown sugar and the ham is all you need. It came out great. The feast was great. I love the way my mom makes yams and her 18 pumpkin pies. Sooooo gooood. After dinner we reviewed the ads for Black Friday. Charles and I had decided the only place we were going to stop was Best Buy.   Friday -- Charles parents came in at about 3am. I know they were exhausted. They flew from South Carolina to LAX. They were there to see their son, Matthew, graduate from the Army National Guard. As soon as they got in they went home for about an hour to re-pack and then drove to Tucson.  I woke up at about 4am to get ready for the Best Buy shopping. Which was absolute madness. The lines were long to get in and to pay. The good thing is that we were only in the store for about 2 hours tops. Later that day we went to the Casino. I broke even and so did Charles.   Saturday -- We relaxed and then got ready. We went to this candy store and bought a crapload of Mexican candy for dirt cheap.  It was like I was in Nogales. We also bought a jar of hot pickles.  Jan and Chuck made dinner for everyone. My parents, Dina and the kids and Angel all came over for dinner. Then later we played Mexican train. Another great evening.  Sunday -- Chuck and Jan left at about 1130. Charles and I went to JCPenney soon after. They were having a great sale and Charles received a 20% off coupon. I haven't bought new clothes in awhile so I was quite excited.

       No gym yesterday or the day before that   There has been so much going on that I haven't been able to go. School, Family, Family and more Family. Of course I have to make up the time.  I need to go and keep it up. I got way too much junk in the trunk that I need to get rid of.

       Email comedy...   SINGLE BLACK FEMALE seeks male companionship, ethnicity  unimportant.  I'm a very good looking girl who LOVES to play. I love long walks  in the woods,riding in your pickup truck, hunting, camping and  fishing trips, cozy winter nights lying by the fire. Candlelight dinners  will have me eating out of your hand. Rub me the right way and watch me  respond. I'll be at the front door when you get home from work,  wearing only what nature gave me. Kiss me and I'm yours.  Call (404) 875-6420 and ask for Daisy.      Over 15,000 men found themselves talking to the Atlanta Humane  Society about an 8-week old black Labrador retriever.      Men are so easy.

       Just Say No To Salt   Awhile ago Charles and I went to a little Ice Cream shop where the sold Mexican Candy and boy did we stock up. One of the many items we purchased was a huge jar of hot pickles. Well now all the pickles are gone BUT the juice is still there. I bought some saladitos and put soaked them in some of the remaining juice from the hot pickles. It was yummy. I took one for Molly to try. I carefully plucked one from its sisters and brothers then gently wrapped it in foil. I get to the gym and some of the juice leaks out and I smell like a pickle the rest of the night. I'm waiting to talk to Molly to see how soon she tossed it.

       What a Day   Well my sister received her test results today. It looks like she might have to have surgery.  I'm not sure if this is bad but I try not to think about it because it scares me. I don't understand why some people have had to go through so much crap and others through practically nothing. I know it is part of life blah blah blah.  Don't get me wrong, I don't wish bad on other people but I can't help to compare.

       Sunday   Let's see... I worked out with Molly. After working out I went home and got ready. Charles and I went to Wal-Mart. I really don't like to go to Wally's during the day especially on the weekend. It is always so packed.    After Wally's we drove to Albertson's. While on the way there, my energy meter went to E. I couldn't even keep my eyes open. It was kind of strange. So I told Charles I would stay in the car while he shopped. Sometimes it is fun being in the car and watching people walk by and they have no idea that someone is watching them. I think I saw about 10 people pick their nose.  When we got home from the grocery store we made dinner and then I played some PS2. I think I fell asleep a few times while I was playing.  I went to bed about 730 and slept like a baby until 6am. It was nice.

       What a great um... good... er um day today is   Well my day isn't all that bad. I went to work out today with Molly. Rode the bike for 40 minutes and then worked on back and abs. I then went home and got ready. I got ready to come to work... yup that's right. I am at work right now working on a project. I actually don't mind so much because Charles is working right now too. Plus if I didn't have work to come to I would just be home playing with my new MP3 player.   Yup that's right your looking at (sorry reading the words from) a Nomad Zen Jukebox owner. 30 gigs of what ever type of music my little heart desires. We went to Best Buy and I asked the guy about the Creative Nomad and his reply kind of upset me... "oh the one that's been out of stock for the past 3 weeks?". I think from the expression of disgust on my face he realized that he was rude and then quickly apologized. "I'm sorry that was a little rude of me wasn't it?" I just looked at Charles and we left the guy standing there. So we headed over to Circuit City and low and behold ONE LEFT!!! The price tag showed $269.99 but I know that Circuit City website had it for $219.98 and asked about price matching. So after he 'made a call' I bought the MP3 player for about $280 with the extended warranty because it only comes with a 3 month warranty and it is the first one I've owned so I didn't want to take ANY chances.

       LMAO   Class yesterday was interesting. First night of class and I think my instructor is challenged. She will talk and then laugh for no apparent reason. Her outfit for the evening consisted of a colorful vest with a black blouse underneath. She then wore a black skirt cut to the knee AND then she wore black knee high stockings. I felt so bad for her when she sat down and you could see where her stockings ended. I had to really concentrate on not laughing out loud when I saw that. Molly isn't in the class so it will not be nearly as entertaining.

       Routine   Yes I am getting into a routine here. Besides the normal eat, work, sleep, school cycle I am throwing in the gym. That's right after much procrastination I have officially become a member of a local gym. I work out with Molly. So far so good. I am working out Saturday through Wednesday. The only day that I don't work out with Molly is on Wednesday because she has class.  Going from never working out to working out 5 times a week wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I am commited to doing it for at least a year since that is how long the contract is for anyway.

       Remember Me?   Yes I know this is so bad. I started this and should commit to an entry once a day or at the very least once a week day. So let's see... what have I been up to? Since the 23rd (the last time I posted) Christmas and New Year's have come and gone. I was in Orlando from 12/26 to 1/5. It was neat being there for New Year's but nothing beats my parent's house.  I couldn't believe all the people that were in Orlando. It was so packed. I guess waiting for 3 hours for a single ride should have been an indicator.  It was so bad that Magic Kingdom was at capacity by noon on New Year's Eve.  So we went to Universal and had an amazing dinner and then watched the fireworks.

       Feliz Viernes!!   Today was a good day. I received my mid-year review. I went to lunch with Michelle and Miss D. I learned on how to automate some of the charts and that will save me some time.  Then we went to eat sushi. The only bad thing about today was I didn't go work out. I didn't get out of work until 6 and it was too late to meet Molly there. Oh well... I will see her tomorrow.

       Raws and Urine   Tonight was the last night of the Global Business Class. Quite interesting. Just like every other class, a group presentation is given. Our group presentation was about Singapore. One of my three topics was to give a political and legal analysis. All was going well.... until I went to say copyright laws.  It came out as 'copywhite raws' laughter erupted. At least I joined the likes of another presenter who wanted to say European monetary but instead it came out is 'urinary'.

       Group meeting   I went to school about 530pm to get a room for our group to meet at 6pm. I figured I would go early not only to get a room but also to start working on the final exam. So there were three people who had asked if I was leaving. Then the fourth person came in and said, "oh are you leaving?" I said no.  "Well we signed up this room"  "I've been here since 530 in this room. What am I supposed to do leave my stuff alone and go down and sign up"  "Well you know the rules"  I could have smaked her. There is not a 'sign up' sheet for rooms at the UofP. All they have is a stupid white board and it's a courtesy not a requirement. Stupid old lady.   Well by this time it was 6 and I told her I would wait 10 minutes for my group. If they didn't show up she could have the room. I should have camped there for the rest of the night even if my group didn't show up.

       Playing catch up   I did some catching up today in more than one way. How you ask? The first was going to the gym again. I'm going to the gym 4 times a week NO MATTER WHAT!  I have just been busy I haven't been able to go but I will... I must  Second way... on the way home from the gym I called Angela. Angela is my best friend from high school. I hadn't talked to her in quite a few months.  The last time I had any contact with her was when she left me a voicemail on my birthday. That was really thoughtful of her and Raymond to call me. I just feel like sometimes we would only talk if I called her. I am perfectly fine with not talking to anyone from high school. Sometimes I will just call them because I am thinking about them, but I think I will stop that practice.

       Whad'ya do this weekend?   On Friday night Charles and I ate sushi. Which was totally against my low-carb diet. I gave up strictly following Atkins. I'm just doing a modified version of it. I'm not necessarily counting carbs. I'm just being smarter about what I eat. Plus going to the gym helps out too.  Saturday was Valentine's day.  Charles and I didn't get each other anything. We agreed before Valentine's day that we would go shopping for each other. We didn't go shopping for each other. I really want to get a PDA. I told Charles and I don't think he was expecting a high end item. It is practical though and I could benefit from it. I'm sure he thought I would say lotion from Bath & Body. I guess it doesn't matter anyway... we didn't go shopping. We went to eat at The Outback about 2pm and then went to the casino. Charles won $60 and I won $70 on the penny machines. It was great!  Sunday was a lazy day. I didn't go to the gym. I put together shelves, did laundry and finished the game Prince of Persia.    Overall it was a nice relaxing weekend.

       Back on track   Yup that's right. I've been home from work a few days. I have what the Dr. called Red Eye. Schmuck. What the heck is red eye? Oh well. Have gave me some drops and my eyes are feeling better.   Today work was ok. Not too busy and not too slow. It was just right.  I went to the gym today. It felt great because the last time I was at the gym was Friday with Molly. Today I was on my own. Well not completely true... I was joined by the music of the B-52s, Tears for Fears, The Outfield and other great 80's bands. This was while I was riding the bike BTW. While I lifted weights... I listened to Trina, Xhibit and other rappers. Their attitude wore off on me a bit well I was lifting.

       No It's not Hookey!   I didn't go to school today. There were other more important things that were pressing. At least I am glad I will sleep tonight and go to bed before 12. I can't wait.  Today is my second day on Atkins. I'm feeling okay. I just get sick of ham and cheese. I know I know. I can spice it up a bit. I just want to lose the weight. I need to figure out my right carb count. I figured that with me working out and doing Atkins... I will be closer to a newer, leaner.... me!

This week I feeling I'm holding on my a thread. One thing is for sure... I am definately looking forward to this weekend. I need sleep. About 10am at work I was ready for a nap... FOLKS... this was at 10am! I need to start on my vitamins again. Maybe that will help. But for right now I can barely keep my eyes open.... I'm going to just rest my eyes for a moment... zzzzz

       Sunday, Monday, Tuesday Cliffnotes   Sunday we ate at the Pier with Charles family. Later that night Charles, Matthew, Caeser (friend of Charles) and I went to shoot some pool. I really suck at pool. I found that I can not shoot a ball in from a foot from the pocket. Mind you it was a straight shot too. Oh well. My hopes and dreams to be a pool shark are over.   Monday we went to visit Charles' cousin, Lynn. She lives by Rancho Cocamunga. She is such a sweety. After visiting Lynn we went to the casino. We lost money and I will leave it at that.   Tuesday we went to the card guy's warehouse and bought some more cards. He also gave us some containers to put them in. The flight home was great. We watched Return of the King for about an hour and before we knew it we were already home. My dad picked us up from the airport. Good Times.

       All Collectors Go To Heaven   Saturday Charles, Jan, Chuck, Matthew (Charles' bro), and I went to  urlLink Frank and Sons . The place where collectors and dealers gather to exchange goodies.  Charles and I fell victim to starting another collection. We started collecting  urlLink >Lord of The Rings Trading Cards by Topps . So far we have three autograph cards: 2 of Aragorn (one of Return of The King and the other from Two Towers) and one of Pippin. We also have three costume cards. Each costume card has authentic fabric used to create the character's costumes. The three costume cards we have are Gandalf, Samwise and Faramir. We got the guy's number who sold them to us in case we wanted to buy more of them. The guy also mentioned something that caught my attention... in May Harry Potter cards are available with the autograph cards and costume cards. I am really excited!

       Friday Night    The flight was fine. I sat in the aisle seat, while Charles sat next to a guy that was quiet the whole time and didn't even want any of the free honey roasted peanuts or Chex Snack Mix. It could have been worse, we could have sit next to someone that reeked of some unholy stench.  Charles' parents (Chuck and Jan) picked us up from the airport. We went straight to their house ate and then went to sleep.

Charles and I are going to LA to visit his parents. This was a trip of Charles choosing. I really prefer this more than going to Vegas which was his original request. I just wasn't in the mood. I will be out of touch for awhile. Stay tuned for more details on how the trip goes.

I have been lucky enough to have the same peers in the past 4-7 classes. Unfortunately we are parting ways with this class.    Speaking of school I really need to put forth some more effort around graduate school. Ugh...

       The Supremes    I wore my hair down to work today. Today I was told that my hair looks like a banshee. My hair also got compared to a Diana Ross wig. The Diana Ross comparison doesn't really hurt my feelings that much.  When I was smaller (3-6ish), when I woke up in the morning I had a major fro going on.  So my sisters would always tell me "good morning Ms. Ross". Of course at the time I hated it.

       Cat in the Crap   I forgot to mention that I watched Cat in the Hat this weekend with Mike Myers. It was awful. In fact it was almost painful to watch. Kelly Preston is in movie along with Alec Baldwin. Whenever I see Kelly Preston in movies, I always think back to her role as Tish on the movie  urlLink  SpaceCamp .  I loved that movie.   Quick fav quotes from that movie:  "Jinx and Max... friends forever".    "Jinx put Max in space"    Catherine (Lea Thompson) - "How's you know all that?"  Tish (Kelly Preston)- "I remember everything I read. It's a real drag sometimes when my mind gets totally cleathered."  Catherine - "What'd you get on your SAT's?"  Tish - "800's. "  Why I love that last quote I have no idea. It just one of the lines that I remembered.

       Teen Night at the Gym   Last night I had to go to the gym a bit early because Charles and I had to make it over to CostCo before it closed. I think last night all the teen boppers work out. It was interesting to listen to there conversations. Well I was riding the bike (sorry Molly no Elliptical machine yesterday), these two girls were talking about the cars they want to get when they turn 16. One said she test drove an IS300. The other one said something like "OH MY GOD... those cars are so ugly. I would never drive a station wagon." The 'test drive' girl said "the one I drove wasn't a station wagon." For about 10 minutes these girls were arguing about a car. One of the girls was upset and left while the other was still cycling.    After I was done with cardio, I worked on arms and back. I over hear yet another conversation about cheerleading. These two girls were talking about how much cheering means to them. Listening to them I remembered the movie  urlLink Bring It On .  I reluctantly admit... I did like the movie. "Brrrr its cold in here... There must be some clovers in the atmosphere!"  So I have them to thank why I have that cheer stuck in my head.

       The Attack of The Red Eye   So I had a touch of the red eye again today. It really sucks. It looks like someone hit my eyeball. I'm starting to think that it is allergies. My eye looked like one of the 'infected' from 28 Days Later.  I'll just spend the day with ice and Clear Eye drops.

       I Know What You Saw At The Movies Today   Charles and I saw  urlLink  Dawn Of The Dead  at the movies today. It was 'ok'. I wasn't blown away by it. Two things were good in the movie. 1) The zombies were really grotesque. I attribute this to the great make-up.  2) The dog in the movie make it out alive! Apparently flesh eating zombies don't like to eat the flesh of non-human creatures hmmm who knew?

       The Me Quiz   I was inspired by the quiz on Molly's blog. So I decided I should create one too.      1)  What is Delisa's favorite animal?   2)  Who was Delisa's childhood best friend?   3)  Delisa's first car was a _____ .    4)  How did Delisa meet Charles?   5)  What instrument did Delisa play in Middle School?   6)  If Delisa could have any job in the world what would it be?       Answers:   1) Koala   2) Christina G.   3) 1991 Maroon Ford Thunderbird  4)On the Internet   5) Violin  6) A Teacher     Scoring:  I am going to use the same scoring convention that Molly decided to use. Why reinvent the wheel?  5+= You know Delisa well.   3-4= You know who Delisa is... for the most part.   0-2= Delisa who?

       Pinky Swear Terms and Conditions       Me:   what happens if for some reason one of the individuals that did pinky swear lost that pinky in a freak accident.    Molly:    hmmmm    Me:   does the 'swear' at that point become null and void?    Molly:   that's a very good question you raise...The entire pinky is gone? Or is there a stub left?     Me:   LOL    Me:   Two completely different sets of circumstances.    Molly:    hmmmm    Molly:   and how many days after the swear was the pinky lost?    Me:   I think that portion is irrelavant.    Molly:   interesting.    Molly:   My thought is....    Molly:   If the pink is lost at the point of Swear Impact or lower, then the swear remains valid.    Me:   I would have to agree but I am sure those who would think "hey I don't have a pinky anymore... it doesn't apply"    Molly:   they would be WRONG!    Me:   I'm glad we had this conversation    Molly:   I am too.    Me:   I don't think I could be friends with someone who didn't have the same views on the 'pinky swear' as me.

       The Midget Woman   No I'm not talking about my mom... I'm talking about my godchild (niece) Asia. I'm so excited because her and I have a date to see Harry Potter: Prisoner of Azkaban on June 4th. I can't wait! I also realized that her and I don't have that many pictures together... BUT we Charles did happen to snap one of us the day of Isaac's Dedication.        Wow... I have man hands in this picture.

       Weeds, Mariachis and a Dark Alley   Before going to my dad's firestaion on Saturday, I did yardwork. Yes I know that is hard to believe but I used a shovel and yanked the weeds out of our front yard. I remember one time the weeds were growing so tall, I could have sworn I saw a few crop circles. I didn't want to let them get that bad, so I yanked those suckers out.  My cousin, Chantelle, was performing at the Mariachi festival at Armory Park on Saturday. I love going to this event. They have great food and excellent music. Plus this year it was a treat because Denise is here. I think this event gives Denise her required Hispanic culture for the trip. It was fun because a lot of the family was there to support Chantelle. It would have been better if Dina and my dad were there. I did happen to get some pics of the cousins while we were there.    Aaron, Chantelle and Jarrod        Joaquin (Michelle's husband), Adrian, Michelle, Aaron and Jarrod       While we were at the park, Charles got a call from his friend Eddie who happened to be in town. We went to visit him at some concert hall called The Muse. The band that he was there with didn't perform until 10pm. We got there about 730pm or so. It was strange because we just hung out in the back of the hall which was this dark alley. We talked until 945pm and then Charles and I went back to my mom's house and hung out for a little while longer. Afterwards we went home.

       Unspoken Tradition   I was really unaware of this. My dad said that it is a tradition to take a picture in front of the firetruck (my dad's a fireman) with the newborn baby. Never knew... My dad was so proud of his new grandson... but don't take my word for it just look at the pictures...    Isaac, Dad and the rest of the crew        Isaac, Denise and Dad sitting on the bumper of the truck        Isaac, Denise and Dad sitting on the bumper of the truck (close-up)

       Movie Night   Friday night was movie night. After Charles got out of work we went to pick up my cousins, Aaron and Jarrod. They are both hilarious. We have so much fun when we're together. We picked up some pizzas and headed back to my parents' home. There is only one movie that I remember watching that night... Jackass. It was their (Denise, Aaron and Jarrod) first time watching the movie. We laughed so hard. After watching that movie, Charles and I went home.

       Double Double Toil and Trouble...   I am a Harry Potter fan. I have read all the books. My two favorites are Prisoner of Azkaban (book 3) and Goblet of Fire (book 4). The Prisoner of Azkaban movie comes out on June 4th... only 43 days away. I am really excited to see this movie and I'm contemplating on dressing up to see it. I of course would be a Gryffindor. I doubt there will be any other 25 year olds dressed up to see the movie though...

       Happy Hair Day   Went to the beauty salon to beautify my hair. The plan was to have my hair cut, highlighted and styled. The place was packed. Well sitting there playing tetris on my PDA, I noticed 5 girls walk in all have the highlights I wanted. So that was out. The three of us (Denise, Dina and I) were supposed to have our hair done by the main beauty person girl lady. She was bilingual so I knew I had a decent chance of having Dina explain what to do to my hair. Why her you ask? Because I have no idea how to 'talk shop' to the beauty people.    Well I didn't get to go with the bilingual beauty girl. I went with a Spanish speaking lady. She's talking to me and I just smiled and laughed when she did. This was all while she was washing my hair. Then I knew she asked me a question because she just looked at me and waited. So I did my best, "no speako spanisho" for her and she got someone to start translating for me. I was okay with this... I knew I had a shot.  So she gave me a brush and asked me (according to the translator) to brush out my hair. Okay easy enough. So I brushed out my hair and Denise came over and said that they were rescheduling their hair appointments to next Wednesday. At this point I just wanted to leave. Well the beauty lady finished cutting my hair she asked (again according to the translator) if I wanted to have my hair styled. I told her no its ok. I will just do it at home.  It came out to $20 and I gave her $10 tip. I know 50% tip, what was I thinking? She was nice and my hair did come out decent. I probably won't have my hair cut for another 2-3 years.  At least I got 1 out of the three (cut, color, and style) that I wanted.  What made the day is having sweet bread from the local 12th Avenue bakery. I love me some Pan Dulce. Well enough for now...

       Random Memory #41798   I'm at Roskruge Middle School in 8th grade. The girls proceed to tell me if I want to be in their 'club' that they would have to initiate me. Thinking about it now that is what gang members did to their new members.  So they talked to Sara and me about it at soccer practice (all the cool girls played soccer). I didn't really care so of course I said fine and so did Sara.  So how did one get initiated you ask?  They told me about 5 minutes before the initiation started.  This took place in the girl's shower room (in the basement). There were about 8 girls besides Sara and myself. They said in order to be in their club they would have to fight us. So 4 girls against Sara and 4 girls against me. The sheep that I am... I said fine. I remember a girl that was supposed to be my best friend (not Sara) said she already went through the initiation the previous week... right.  Back to the fight. There were 4 girls surrounding me and all I remember were two of the girls names: Reinah and Michelle. The so called leader of the group was Laura. Laura said she would say go and the fight would begin.  She even said she would count backwards from 5.   5-4-3-2... I remember looking at tile on the ground and thinking how dirty it was and I hope I don't fall on the floor. I also remember looking at Laura as she whispered something to my best friend and they looked at me and laughed.  1.... go!  Reinah and Michelle started hitting me but it didn't hurt. She was small and Reinah was about my size. I punched Reinah a few times but then backed away and just let them hit me. I didn't want to hurt Michelle because she was so much smaller than me. I didn't want to hit Reinah because she was my 'friend' and I didn't want to hurt her.  As quickly as it started... it stopped. Everyone was silent as we walked out of the showers. I remember changing and asking Reinah if I hurt her when I punched her those couple of times. She said it hurt a little.   Why I brought this up I don't know. Like the title says random memory.

       Gripe #4152   I hate it when strangers come by my desk and pick up my silly puddy. Gross... I have no idea where there hands have been. Who knows how many of them don't wash their hands. I will have to start hiding my silly puddy.   In other news... Charles has called me a few times today to see what time I will be home. He wants to make sure that I'm there to sign for his package of hot wheels. He's so cute. That's all he has been talking about since he ordered it two weeks ago.

       To Flush Or Not To Flush   Why is this even a question? I walk into the bathroom today (at work). The 16 stalls of the of one of the women's bathrooms are broken into two groups of 8 stalls. I walk into one of the sections and the first 5 stalls I go into have 'remains'. Yes I know this is gross but I just need to get it off my chest. For goodness sakes... just flush the toilet and if you need to... flush it again.  Okay I've done my ranting and raving for the day.

       Flag Quiz   At church the other night I saw that they had flags up from different nations and I realized how awful I am at geography. Not only do I have a weakness for identifying flags but my knowledge on history is awful as well. UGH...  I decided to take a Flag Quiz. On one of the questions I had to identify the flag of Ireland (of course I didn't) but afterwards it gives you a sentence of history of the country. Irelands history tidbit was "This flag is from Ireland, which is also the setting of the Great Famine of 1845-1850. Over one million people died in Ireland when the potato crops became diseased."  I really suck at history. BUT come one honestly I knew the flag they were showing was either from Italy or Ireland. They are both using basically the same colors. Can you tell the difference?            Didn't think so! Yeah yeah yeah... one is red and one is orange. BUT THEY ARE SOOO CLOSE!!!

       Random Memory #453982   My favorite animal is a koala and I had a big stuffed animal of a koala bear. Before I was 6, I remember going to the San Diego Zoo and falling completely in love with this koala bear. I gave it freedom (for a small fee at the San Diego Zoo souvenir store) and took it home with me. The name of the koala was Pansas. I loved that koala bear so much.   Sad thing is I have no idea what happened to it.

       #1 is back   We went to the airport yesterday and picked up Denise and the midget man Isaac. He is so adorable. He is 6 weeks old and last night was the first night that we all got to see him. Of course my dad held him first and cried.     Oh and I was right about the family affair at the airport... for the most part we all went except for my grandparents.     We were supposed to go to church today, but didn't make it on time. Charles and I have to start attending church more often. I think we went a total of about 2 times last year. I know that is awful...BUT we are off to a good start. We already went once this year so we are half way to tying our church attendance record from last year.

       Postponing the Rest of My Life   Honestly I had every intention of going to the gym and working out. Got up got ready to go called Too Tall and arranged a time... but NO go. Molly and I decided to have the 'First Day of The Rest Of Our Lives' another day. I think the agreement was for Tuesday.   Today we pick up Denise and Isaac at the airport and I'm sure it will be a family affair. My grandparents, my parents, Dina, Abram, Asia, Charles and I will go for the event. Afterwards we will go to one of Denise's 'must eat' places.  Among her 'must eat' list...  Eegee's  Any Mexican Food place  Lucky Wishbone  Wienershnitzel (no clue on how to spell it)

       Let's get physical...   Went to the gym again... Did about 35 minutes of cardio and then worked on arms and back.  I have to get back in the swing of things again... I must.    I have to admit something. I have a guilty pleasure. I was watching Making The Band 2.  There I said it. It is off my chest. This burden has weighted me down for some time. Well last night Tony (Sara's husband) got into it with Babs. I can't believe Sara just sat there the whole time and didn't say anything. I won't go into the specifics of all the show because they can be read at the  urlLink Making The Band 2 Episode Guide .

       Back on the Saddle...    Went to the gym last night with Molly. The remodeled our gym so now it smells like carpet in the cardio room. I don't like it.  Give me back the wet dog smell. I had made a comment to Molly that Tuesday is the first day of the rest of our lives. Well we moved that day to Wednesday. Then after a extremely light workout we decided that we can't just jump right into the 'rest of our lives'. So instead we will carefully assimilate into the rest of our lives. This means we eventually build up to a great workout. For now I'll settle for a 'I better stop now cause I don't feel like it' workout.

       Charles' song   Awhile ago when Charles and I were officially a couple he said he found a song that is his song to me. He gave it to me on a tape but while we were in CA for his b-day I was looking through his mom and dad's CD collection and it was in there.       Godsend       by DC Talk    Hoping, praying, I've been waiting  Everybody needs somebody to love  There's no question, straight from heaven  You're my angel, I'm so crazy for you   You're a Godsend  A blessing from above  You've been God-sent to me  You're the Godsend  I've been dreaming of  You're a Godsend   Holding your hand, touching your face  I will love you now and always I swear  I will never forget that first moment we met  When two worlds collided and I found my best friend   You're a Godsend  A blessing from above  You've been God-sent to me  You're the Godsend  I've been dreaming of  You're a Godsend   I was made for you, you were made for me  In this lonely world, we were meant to be in love  I will never forget that first moment we met  When two worlds, they crashed in  And I found my best friend   You're a Godsend  A blessing from above  You've been God-sent to me  You're the Godsend  I've been dreaming of  You're a Godsend

       Shrimp and chili    Today we went to Little Mexico to celebrating Charles' 30th b-day. Yes I know, I know. His birthday was really March 29th, but my parents wanted to get together to celebrate his b-day. Since we were in California for his b-day... this is the next best thing.   Charles loves this dish at Little Mexico called Shrimp Chili Relleno. I haven't had it but he swears by it. I had shredded beef tacos and a small bowl of menudo.

       First time in a long time...    Today was the first day I went to the gym in 10 days. I walked the treadmill and rode the back with Too Tall. Immediately afterwards Molly and I contemplated on what we were working on.  Would we work on arms, back, legs, abs or our final decision.... NOTHING! That's right. TT and I left right after cardio. Oh well. We will actually work out on Tuesday.

       Quarterly Dinner   Last night Dina invitied me to be her date to the Quarterly Sales Dinner. In order to qualify you have to have been the top in four sales metrics in your particular department. I'm so proud of her. She did it!! The dinner was held at Westin La Paloma. Of course the place is beautiful. When we arrived we were met by several co-workers. One of the gals from work and I went out onto the terrace. We both looked by the pool and noticed there was a ping pong table set up. We both agreed if things got to boring we would sneek out to the ping pong table.  The seating was assigned. Which I usually don't mind. It gives you a chance to mingle. Usually when there is assigned seating I sit in the back with some Sales Agents. But nooooo... instead I sit right up front next to the Director and Senior VP. That was interesting. We chatted a lot, had dinner, drinks, then the awards presentation proceeded. Afterwards all was said and done... we went home. I didn't even get to play ping pong.

       I got my license   I was able to drive myself to work today. Yippee.   Yesterday Charles picked me up from work and then we drove to my parents house. We picked up our family portraits from when the big chuck was in town with the I-Man. The off to the grocery store and home.  Charles and I watched some junk on the tv. I was bored out of my mind and so I went to our game closet and dusted off the dominos for some Mexican Train. Charles beat me by about 400 points. I will get my revenge soon.

       Redeye   Charles brought me to work today since I can't really drive. It really sucks having this eye condition. I couldn't keep my eyes open too long. The sun just hurts my eyes like heck. Yesterday was like an adventure. I couldn't keep both eyes open when I tried to drive to work so I had to take turns... 'camera one, camera two, camera one, camera two'. I didn't want to go through that again today that's why Charles brought me. I hope tomorrow I can drive myself to work.

        The waiting room    I love going to the Dr's office. It's my favorite. Usually I'm in and out in less than 30 minutes. Today is a different story. My appointment was for 11am. Whenever I go to the doctor I try to be at least 10 minutes early. Today I arrived at 1055 and the waiting room was full of elderly people. About five of them would go on a coughing marathon and then moan really loud afterwards. About 30 minutes into the coughing symphony, my name was called. I felt like a million bucks. I was overfilled with joy and on the inside I was celebrating like I just made a touchdown in the Super Bowl.  I went through the whole triage: height, weight, blood pressure, shoe size, etc. Then the continuation of the waiting game in the examination room. About 20 minutes later the Doc came in and apologized for the wait. Then looked at my eyes and asked me a series of questions. Come to find out my corneas are scratched from wearing my contacts. He told me to see my eye doctor before I wear my contacts again, which after going through this I probably won't.

       The Rage is Back   Woke up this morning and found my eyes were red again. It is the freaking contacts it just has to be. I don't know what else it could be. I rested my eyes until 11am and then got ready.  Charles and I went to the movies and had every intention to see Shrek 2 but shows were sold out. Instead we watched Van Helsing... yawn. I fell alseep a few times. Let's just say Charles refers to the moving as Van Helstink. I will never get those couple hours back from my life... never.

       Saturday Shindig   Last night Charles and I went to Molly's going away party. IT WAS A BLAST!! First of all the party was at Erick and Michelle's house (what a nice house). Their son is such a cutie and a ball of energy. Apparently while everyone was having a great time Cole was battling huge bad guys. I didn't know what a big deal it was until he said he was on level four. Cole saved the house... and the entire world!  Then the Dance Dance Revolution pads came out. Molly went head to... er um I meant foot to foot with practically everyone. As someone at the party said it was a "dance duel to the death" and someone else shouted, "death by dancing". It was just amazing. I was challenged but respectfully declined. You see I'm not that coordinated. I'm lucky I can  breathe and do anything else at the same time. Molly was quite the dancing queen.  After Molly boogie downed all her challengers, we hung out for awhile. Then left for home. I thaked Charles for going. He originally said he was too tired but he decided to join me anyways. He even had a good time.   I only have one regret... I didn't take a camera but I'm sure there were enough cameras that I will see a couple of pics eventually.

       Ms. Ross?   Last night Charles and I joined my sister, Terri and her daughter Monica at Old Pueblo Grill. I had a couple of Fat Tires and Charles attempted to some sort of margarita that was waaaaaay to strong. He couldn't drink it. The topic of conversation was fun.   Dina and Terri went to high school together and reminisced about those days. Little did I know that before Denise or Dina went out, their chores had to be completed. Denise and Dina had a 'chore' to brush out my hair after I took a bath. I didn't remember at all. Terri said she witnessed this event time and time again. She said they used to part my hair in the middle and each of them would take a side. My head would go this way and that. Just to give you an idea of my hair... I would be called Ms. Diana Ross by my sisters growing up. The memory was a great laughing piece for all.    After Old Pueblo Grill we went to the Harley-Davidson because of a car show that was being held there. My Uncle David bought a 69 Impala a couple weeks ago and entered it into th show. Everything in the car was stock and it looked nice. After the car show we went to Kon Tiki's for about an hour and then came home.

       Gripe #41248   This one isn't that big a deal but I just thought I would mention it. I was walking down the hall at work today and realized that I don't take up much room because I usually walk along the wall. I came to this realization because this lady was walking towards me with another 'walkmate' and didn't move out of my way. Mind you had I been walking down the middle of the hall I would move. But I was walking along the wall and she was walking in the middle. Well maybe not in the middle but if I had to divide the hall into 'walkable' places, there would be 5 sections.  Sections 1 and 5 are along the walls and section 3 would be in the middle. I was in section 5 and she in 4. I can't go anywhere... where did she want me to move? There was no one in sections 1 and 2... she could have moved. Ahhhhh!!!  I realize the above was just ranting and raving, but I feel much better now.

       Eclipse and lip gloss   I went to the store today. I realized that I forgot to get a gift bag for Molly. So I went to the store and bought some Eclipse mints (my new favorite) and a gift bag and tissue paper. Afterwards I went back to the house to pick up Molly's gift and put them in the bag.  Molly's gift is different types of lip glosses. There were some flavors that I didn't even know existed. I know one of them was 2000 Cookies. Being that they were lip glosses I know I couldn't leave them out too long because... of course they would melt. So I had to time it just right.   I left the house about 4:40. I thought it would take me a lot longer to get to Molly's place but I was there about 4:50. I know Molly gets out of work at  5:00. So I waited until 5:00 in my car. Dropped them off and left. It was kind of like Mission Impossible. Okay... maybe not but that theme song was playing in my head well I was waiting.

       That's my song...   I was just thinking about the songs that my dad picked out for his girls. Dina's song is "Always" and Denise's song is "That's All". My song is "Daddy's Little Girl". I then started thinking about if I ever had a munchkin, what my song to him or her would be.   I have some front runners of course:  "If This World Were Mine" by Marvin Gaye featuring Tammi Terrell  "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" by Marvin Gaye featuring Tammi Terrell    Of course I have plenty of time to think about it.

       Swooosh   Today I bought tickets to see Phoenix Mercury. I'm so excited to see Ms. Diana Taurasi play for Mercury. I think it will be awesome. Charles and I will see three games. One of the games is against the LA Sparks. It will be awesome to see the best Center... I'm talking about Lisa Leslie. Oooh oooh... plus Teresa Weatherspoon is an awesome guard. Charles and I will see three games. One is against the Sparks like I said earlier. The two others are against Shock (2003 WNBA Champs) and Fever (Ebony Hoffman AKA Big Dog graduated with Charles' brother).

       Case of the Mondays   Work was the usual stuff... blah blah blah.  After work I went home and played with Pixie and Bo for awhile before going to school. I didn't even do my assignment. When I talked to the instructor about not turning in the assignment she said I could turn it in today for full credit. That will be easy enough.

       Sunday   Today I slept late. I went to bed about 1030pm and slept until 9am. I guess the moving wore me out. After laying around and being lazy and watching Big Fish I got ready to meet my parents. Charles and I met my parents, Dina and the kids at Outback. Then we came home to watch Kill Bill V1.

       Moving Day   Moving day started promptly at 930am and ended about 3:30pm. It was so hot and moving my cousin into her apartment was no easy task. She had a second floor apartment. Ahhh! I guess it could have been worse. The apartments were three stories and she could have picked a penthouse suite.

       Moving On Up...   Last night Dina, Abram, Asia, Charles and I saw Troy. It was decent. Now I have to go back and read Homer's Iliad to really see how accurate it was. Plus I'm done with the book Angels & Demons by Dan Brown so I have to read something else.  Later today I am going to help my cousin move. We will see how that goes.

       One Mic   I left work about 5pm yesterday. Ugh!!!! Charles was supposed to go to orientation at University of Phoenix. He wasn't feeling up to it so he blew it off. That gave us some time to spend together.We went to eat some wings and hamburgers. Afterwards we went to Target and Albertson's.   We need needed to get some supplies at Target. One of the items we needed to purchase was a mop. Well we strolling around Target I kept taking the mop and talking into the top of it like it was a mic. Then I would put it down and ask Charles a question. When he started talking I grabbed my 'mic' and put it in his face, then he would stop talking. I played this game longer than I'd like to admit. It was funny. Then while we were in the checkout line I tried it again. He finally gave me the 'no comment' line. My last try... I asked him to please say something into the mic. He then said "Testes, testes, 1-2-3". It was hilarious.

       Coffee Update   It is 10am and I haven't had my cup of happiness yet. Ugh. I have a headache. I am sure I will be getting the shivers soon. I think these are symptoms of withdrawl.   In other news...I went back to the gym last night. It was the first time in about 5 weeks. It felt great.

       The "other" factor...   While at the gym, I asked Molly about the 'pee' posting. She mentioned length of pee. Which in thinking about it now I guess I would have to clearly define what I mean by 'length'. For example, a woman walks into the stall... we do not start the timer yet. You hear her unzip or detangle herself... we do not start the timer yet. And I am purposely saying she... I don't remember the last time I was in a men's restroom. (Well I do but story for a different time.)  The start time would be the first instance the act of peeing is actually audible to the time it stops. Now... combine that with what I posted earlier about torque. That could be quite a game.   The perfect example of this is the movie A League of Their Own. Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks' character) goes into the ladies locker room for the first time and starts to pee. Mae (played by Madonna) times him (although it isn't quite when he starts) and at the end of the peeing fest she says, "That's good some good peeing".

       Not that best subject..   but oh well. I walked into the bathroom and while I was using the facilities (#1 if you must know). There was a herd of women in that came into use the bathroom.   I was listening to all the ways that women pee. I'm sure it has something to do with volume of pee and pressure one exerts, this in turn affects the velocity at which pee impacts the toilet. All I'm saying is that there was quite a lot of torque for some and not so much for others. Okay enough of this subject.

       Coffee Anonymous   I hate to admit it. I think I'm an addict. I need coffee! What I don't get is that I am completely fine on the weekend and can go without. During the week... my motivation for coming to work is knowing that there will be hot(and free) cup of coffee. I used to look down upon the coffee addicts and now I have become one. Whyyyy?  If that wasn't bad enough... when this habit started they used to have a good sized styrofoam cup. Now.. they made the cups smaller. Of course I could get two cups but I somehow felt cheated. UGHHH! Pretty soon I know I will have brown ugly teeth. I should just start investing in whitening strips now.   I think I will do an experiment. I will try to pass on coffee tomorrow to see if I notice a change.  I would do it today but I already had my cup of brain juice for the day... (and it was good).

       Typical Monday   Monday night is the typical school night. Much to my surprise time in class last night went by much quicker. The topics were somewhat interesting. We reviewed different types of torts in law. I can't recall any of them right now... negligence, intentional torts, something like that.

       Going Back to Cali... again   Saturday and Sunday consisted of long stays at the hospital. Much to my surprise the hospital cafeteria had great minestrone. We ate there a couple of times.   Saturday night we played poker and spades. I won both times... woowoo!   Sunday we went to the hospital again. Sue (Charles' grandma that's in the hospital) was sitting up when I went in to see her. I felt kind of akward going in to see her. I didn't want to see her alone so I went with Charles' Aunt Peggy. When I went into her room she was sitting up in a chair. Also she had tubes coming out of everywhere. If someone were to pick her up by all the tubes she would look like a marionette.   There was food on the tray in front of her and the only thing that I feard was that Aunt Peggy would ask if I could feed her. Then something else that made me feel kind of funny was the fact that she had to put her teeth in. At this point I don't think I could have stayed in the room much longer. So I helped out with the feeding by asking what she wanted to eat. After about 10-15 minutes I told her bye and told Aunt Peggy that I was going out so someone else could come in. Then Charles' grandma said, "Thank you so much for coming".

       Going Back to Cali..   Last nights flight was fine. My mom dropped me off at the airport early and I was in the coveted 'A' group. This means I got to board the plan ahead of about 150 others. I was about 10th in line and when I sat down I thought for sure I would have an empty space next to me but some lady sat by me. She passed my 'good flight neighbor' test: 1)Wasn't obese so she was touching me when she really didn't mean to; 2) Didn't smell; 3) Only spoke when spoken to.   Getting to Charles' parents house was easy enough. I got there, the fed me and we watched Last Samurai, then went to bed.

       Bag Lady   I was up late last night doing a load of wash and packing for the short trip. I am amazed at my packing skills. I used the smallest luggage for my clothes which includes 3 outfits for 2 days. My mom taught me to always pack one more then what was really needed... "you can never be safe". I fly out tonight and then I will be back on Sunday. I expect the weekend to be uneventful, which isn't totally that bad. I know we will spend some time in the hospital so I made sure to pack a book. I probably would have packed myself soem crayons and a coloring book but decided not to because I may be forced to share.

       The big 6-0!!!   Today is my dad's birthday. He is the big 6-0 today. I got him a present and a card but I didn't get to see him on his birthday because he worked late. I hate it when they send him to Nogales at 5pm because it means he will not be back until after 9pm. UGH!   I told my mom that we would have to get together to celebrate his b-day and Mother's Day since I will be out of town and my dad also has to work on Mother's day. Maybe a nice dinner. We shall see.

       Finally   I bought my tickets to go to LA today.   In other news I bought my mom and sister their Mother's Day Cards yesterday. I was among the throng who were purchasing cards. I couldn't believe all the people in the card section at Target. After selecting 3 cards: birthday card for my dad and 2 for Mom's day.   It was kind of nice browsing the store without Charles. YES I MISS HIM!!! But I have to admit, it was nice being able to look around without the sigh of boredom from him or the feeling of being rushed.   While I was looking at the baby clothes for the I-Man, I saw Too Tall checking out. I considered yelling "Cracker your beans are over here!!!!" but decided not to. Plus, I don't think I can yell that loud.

       Walk, Eat, Walk   Went to eat with Molly at Gavi. We walked from her apartment to the restaurant. I had stuffed eggplant which was excellent. Molly had cheese whatchamacallit. I think it was tortellini. Talked about this and that. Mostly about that. Walked back to her place and she gave me a sourvenir Minnie Mouse doll from her Disneyland trip. Minnie Mouse has 6 points of articulation. Minnie will be my new desk mate.

       Hasta Luego   My parents accompanied me to the airport in Phoenix yesterday to drop off Charles. Why Phoenix and not Tucson you ask? Nothing was available yesterday from Tucson to LAX, but there were some from Phoenix to Ontario which is closer to the hospital Charles' grandma is in. So we dropped him off at the Phoenix airport with an In and Out burger and he was set.  My parents and I went shopping at JCPenney outlet. Picked up some socks for $.99 for Charles and picked up four big plastic pots for outside. Spent less than $25, Charles would be proud. Afterwards we went to Cracker Barrel for dinner then drove home.

       Rough weekend   Friday night was the last time I saw Denise and Isaac before they left today. I didn't think it would impact me so much. I hard such a hard time sleeping. I was crying so much I had to get up because I didn't want to wake up Charles. He slept like a log.   Saturday we cleaned house. I had about 7 loads of laundry that I had to wash. I didn't even realize Charles and I had enough clothes that would make 7 loads.   Charles got up early to make his toy rounds. I got up early thinking that I would join him. He was supposed to go to Target and then come home and pick me up to go to a toy show. Of course after I showered at 730am, I decided not to go so I called him and told him to just head straight to the toy show.   While I was getting ready,  Jan (Charles' mom) called. She wanted to let us know that her mom had a heart attack and was in ICU. She was stable but they were going to run tests on her. I immediately called Charles. He came home and called his mom. We bought a airline ticket for Charles to go. He will be there today and comeback on Wednesday.

      Yes it's true. I was among the first to see  urlLink Spiderman 2 . It was actually a last minute decision. A coworker of mine said she was going to see the movie at midnight and asked if I'd like to go. I talked to the husband and he said fine.  I got out of class last night at about 9:55... UGH! I went home and picked up Charles and we headed over to the theater. When we got there I expected a long line, but to my surprise there was no line at all. We headed right in and saw the reason why. There were people seated already... but it wasn't too packed at 10:45.    Enough about that... let me tell you about the movie:  The special effects were good. They would be great but there were some digimations (is that a word?) that were cheesy. Yes I know it is a comic book but they weren't as clear and looked more cartoonish. The music was great! There were three prevalent plots:   1)Good vs. Evil - Of course there was the evil guy Dr. Octopus. Without giving away the ending... I had trouble with the way the struggle came out. My thoughts were "he could have done that at any time he wanted?" Once you see the movie you will know what I'm talking about.  2)Identity - Peter Parker (aka Spiderman) has trouble with the dual life i.e. hero vs. average joe. Of course we know how that ends up. Go Spidey go!  3)Relationships - This was the one I was most interested in. There was the Harry (Green Goblin's son) turmoil with Spiderman. Harry basically wants to avenge his father's death. There was also the relationship with Mary Jane... yay! (I am saying no more about that one).    I loved the movie and in no way was I disappointed. The ending definately left me wanting more.

      First of all I'm sorry I haven't been posting. So to all my reader (yes I know it's not plural) I apologize.     "You're gonna stand there, owning a fireworks stand, and tell me you don't have no whistling bungholes, no spleen spliters, whisker biscuits, honkey lighters, hoosker doos, hoosker donts, cherry bombs, nipsy daisers, with or without the scooter stick, or one single whistling kitty chaser?" -- Joe Dirt to a fireworks salesman    The familia should be back from Montana today. Yay! My nephew called me on Sunday to make sure he bought me some Black Cats. They are bringing back some fireworks and I'm so excited. Now where to set them off is onther thing... I'm sure I'll have fun with that.

      Just got an update from the folks in Montana. Apparently Asia and Jesus (Abram's friend) were at the river behind my sister's home. Jesus was swimming and Asia caught a turtle. She caught a freakin' turtle? She is so adventurous and nothing like my handsome boy Abram. Abram was so clean as a kid. I remember once when he fell in the water in the garden section of KMart. He was totally grossed out and started gagging. I think he puked on himself too because he was so grossed out. Asia was the one that liked to play in the mud and get dirty. She's my midget woman... my turtle catching midget woman.

A friend:    Toby Kunta Kinte Milton bradley Lamar Burton Madero Perez    Me:   YES! I'm writing that one down     Later it gets better... let's just say that many of the names started with Ivana and followed up by middle names that would cross my PG rating.

      Yes it is true... I'm back on the coffee. It is awful because I'm not used to the cafeine and when I drink it I can't concentrate. But I need it to help keep me awake, but what good am I if I can't concentrate?    Damn this cup of brain juice! Damn you Juan Valdez! Okay I don't really mean it because I'm sure I will be snuggling up to my cup tomorrow morning.

      I had that line from Nell stuck in my head yesterday: 'Twee in da win, chickapee, ma and pa and mae'. I just kept saying it over and over.     Last night Charles and I watched a foreign film called   urlLink Musa . It was okay. I only agreed to watch it because I wanted to play Dynasty Warriors 3 afterwards. After I got my fill of DW3, I finished my school work. I'm taking Buyer Behavior now and it should be a breeze. I will keep my fingers crossed.

      I forgot to mention something that happened while we were eating at Claim Jumper's. While we were eating I just started wondering about the waiters and waitresses. I wondered if they ever got sick of watching people eat. So I made the comment to Charles and about a minute later he stopped eating. He looked at me and asked me why I even brought it up because now he couldn't eat his food. He said that he looked around and the people eating grossed him out. Truth be told, I too was getting grossed out by looking at people eat and I had to stop. The food that I did have was great though. You know the whole 'think before you speak' doesn't really stick in my head. I guess at times I have no inner monologue.

      After the game Friday, Charles and I stayed the night in Phoenix. Saturday he got up early and got ready to go to KMart. He had to look up a location of a KMart and off he went. They were having some sort of Hot Wheels event. He called me afterwards and said he got some cars that he needed for his collection. Yay!   After that he came and we checked out of the room and went to eat at Claim Jumper. Love there food. We walked around the mall and then headed home.

      Friday night was my introductory game to the WNBA. The whole experience was awesome! We got there about 6:45pm and the game started at 7. We were watching the gals warmup.  Diana Taurasi is the one with the bun (in the middle)     The Mercs played the L.A. Sparks. Lisa Leslie (center for the Sparks) is such a unique player. She seems like she is bored of playing and not putting forth any effort. She scored 17 points, had 2 assists and 1 blocked shot. The Sparks could have fed it into her all night long.  The awesome player was of course Ms. Diana Taurasi. I have to admit she was cold the first 8-10 minutes but she just was on fire after. She typically averages 17 points per game but last night she had 25 points and 3 assists. Some of the shots she made reminded me so much of Magic. I'm so happy I got to see her play and it seems that she is quit the crowd favorite. The crowd went wild anytime she scored and also if her name was mentioned.   The Sparks did seem like they were going to have an easy win becaus at one point they led by as much as 23 points. The Mercs made a few runs and by the end of the game the score was 76-74... Sparks. Well shucks!    View from our seats. The player there is Lisa Leslie.         Ooooh... Kimberly Locke was there and sang the National Anthem... WOW! She has a set of pipes.She also sang during halftime.        One more thing about the whole Mercury experience. I didn't quite catch it at first. It took me about 15 minutes into the game. There were plenty of bi-level haircuts and mullets on the ladies. There was this one lad... I mean lady that kept yelling during the game. It appeared that Lisa Leslie is not a favorite in Phoenix. She seemed to be a ref fav according to the lady. Some of her jeering follows:  "What happened Lisa did you break a nail?"   "Oh don't be to rough with Lisa!"   right after the foul she said "Lisa don't your elbows ever get sore?!" (personal fav)

      I am wearing my new Hufflepuff shirt today. For the muggles it is one of four houses in Hogwarts... ya know from Harry Potter?        So I go and get some water this morning and someone goes to me are you sure that you should be wearing that shirt to work? I was totally thinking it was a joke but after about 5 seconds of silence I took it that this person was serious. I asked why they felt it was inappropriate. "You know HUFF and PUFF?"   I politely smiled and said that it was not a reference to anytype of recreational drug use but to a house in Hogwarts from Harry Potter. They looked at me and said 'right'.  I have never seen this person before in my life. I'm sure they work here because they have a badge but they were new to me. What nerve!

He took a couple of pics and I thought I would share them...     North Rim of the Grand Canyon      Jesus, Dad, Asia and Mom breakin' the fast

      Charles called me at work yesterday telling me that it was the worst day of his life. He said that he had to call 911 twice in one day. He's in charge of a summer program that has about 80 kids. He went on to explain that there was a runaway and another occurence.   I told him instead of making his day worse by cooking for him, that I will take him out to eat. So we had Chinese food and rented a couple of DVDs. We watched  urlLink 50 First Dates  and I thought it was cute. I love practically anything with Drew Barrymore. Adam Sandler's movies are pretty good except  urlLink Little Nicky  that was 90 minutes that I will never get back from my life. The other movie we rented was  urlLink Paycheck . I haven't watched it yet and have this feeling of disappointment settling in my stomach since Ben Affleck is in it. I hope to be presently surprised.

      I had a meeting at work yesterday from 4-5 that was really from 4-5:30. GROSS!    Last night after I got home I had to endure  urlLink My Baby's Daddy ... yuck. I think I smirked at one or two parts of the movie.

      I got an A in Business Law. Yay! I realize now that I have four classes left. That means 19 more weeks of school. Hey that is really 18 weeks of school because I will be missing the 4th week of my new class, Buyer Behavior.   Speaking of my new class my instructor reminds me so much of Chris Kattan. You know the little guy that was on SNL? He brought the characters of Mango, Roxbury guys, Mr. Peepers, Azrael (goth guy), Gay Hitler, plus a dozen more to life. "Maaaaaaannngo!" I think this one should be interesting.

      I'm in such a funk over the work occurences for the past few days. But what can ya do? So I decided to stop getting all worked up about the whole situation and move on. Not moving on from the company but moving on in the sense that I'm putting this issue back in the drawer and will open it up another time.

      In high school I was the first one to drive out of all my friends. So naturally I was the taxi when we went out except for one night.   On a Saturday night, I picked up A, J and M to go to a quincenera party at some dance hall. Well I was lucky enough to pick up a variety of liquor and we drank it on the way. Ugh.. I remember it was St. Ides too (the red and blue ones). So we drank it and then went to the dance hall and headed inside. We met several of our friends there and continued to drink in the parking lot.   Well all good things must come to an end... BUT I couldn't drive. I was completely gone (yes now I realize it was really stupid but I was in high school cut me some slack). So my friend J, who just got her driver's permit earlier that week, had to drop M and A. A and I were fighting for some reason I can't recall. After droping them off, she had to get home.   Of course I was in no condition to drive but she drove me to my house. We got down and she waited in the living room. I stumbled to my parents room and knocked on the door and told my dad that he would have to take J home. He asked me why and I told him I 'felt funny'. He asked why and I told him someone must have spiked my drink. My dad was furious and the best part that it wasn't at me! He put on his coat and took J home and took me straight to the TMC emergency room.   I escaped being grounded but I paid for it the next day while I was praying to the almighty porcelain god to make the pounding in my head stop.

      Went over to my parents house tonight to bid them a fond farewell. They are off to see the big chuck in Montana. My dad, mom, Abram, Asia and Jesus (Abram's friend) are all leaving to Montana. They are going to be gone for two and a half weeks! My handsome boy and midget woman are not going to be here. That also means that my dad isn't going to be here for Father's Day :(     I will just have to make sure that I give my mom my pop's card. Oooh I also have to get a card for Chris (Denise's husband) because this is his first Father's Day with I-Man.

      Friday  Charles and I went to go eat at Wing Stop. Had me some goodola chicken wings. Afterwards we went to Target and I cut myself on a shopping cart. How you ask? I have no clue. I was just walking along the aisles getting the necessities and I look down and and noticed a red stuff on the cart (not the red handle BTW). I look at my arm and there was blood everywhere. So I went to the bathroom cleaned off and had the cart cleaned and continued my shopping adventure.     Saturday   Charles and I met my mom, Dina and the kids for lunch. Afterwards we went to the movies and saw  urlLink Shrek 2 . I loved it. I especially liked the Antonio Banderas' character Puss In Boots. Afterwards, we went home and went swimming. Later we watched  urlLink Mystic River . Bleh... it was just okay. I expected more. I'm not a big Sean Penn fan but he did do a great job in this movie. Other than that... bleh.    Sunday  Didn't do a darn thing all day. I invited my family over but they were busy getting ready for the Montana trip. It was a great day to just unwind and take a dip. That is exactly what we did. Oh I did buy my ticket to go to Montana in July. It was $350. eeek. I'm sorry I waited so long to buy it. Charles isn't going to come with me to Montana, instead he is going out to visit the folks in L.A. We bought his ticket there and I have to drop him off at the bahoozie early hour of 5am July 2nd. He sure is lucky I love him.  =)

      Awhile ago Molly told me about the In2Books Pen Pal Program. I filled out the form last October and got as far as submitting a introductory letter and a visual profile. I never heard back from them... until now!  I guess they waited for the new school year and asked me to do everything over again, so I did. Maybe this time I will actually have some pen pals.

      Last night Charles went swimming and I sat on the edge of the pool. The pool is the perfect temperature. I didn't want to go swimming because I would have to dry my hair before bed... yes I was being lazy. Sitting by the pool with Bo on my lap was nice.   After about 40 minutes, I went inside and played  urlLink Army Men:RTS . It is the typical Command and Conquer strategy game. I just love it because the army men are the green plastic toys. Of course I looked up some codes for extra plastic because that is the material needed for buildings, cars, and soldiers. It just reminded me of the good ole Contra code for Nintendo. The code that gave you infinite lives. I can't believe I still remember that code.   UP, DOWN, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, A, B, A, B, Select, Start.   Yet another piece of useless information. I'm sure there is a lot more where that came from.

      I went to see it Friday night with Charles, Asia, a co-worker and her boyfriend. We got there about five for the seven showing and there were still 15 people in front of us. I didn't mind waiting, before we went to see the movie Charles bought me a box of PoA trading cards by  urlLink Artbox . Apparently in order to get the costume cards, prop cards or autographs you need to buy the hobby box which is about $100 more. It was fun opening the card packs though.      Back to the movie though... it was great. It was better than the first two and much darker. I just find it amazing that the movie is exactly the way I imagined it when I read book 3 from the Dementors to Trelawney to the Maurader's map to Buckbeak. I plan on reading the book again this week and then go watch the movie again.      My favorite character is Hermione. She has some great moments in the movie. I absolutely love the part where she punches Draco in the nose. Oh and her line of "is that really what my hair looks like from behind?" was great!  I can't wait for  urlLink Goblet of Fire . It is supposed to be released in November 2005. The count down begins.

      Sunday June 6th is my parent's 40th wedding anniversary. My Dad decided to surprise my mom and renew their wedding vows. It was great watching them renew their vows. My Dad got teary eyed and my Mom cried. Here they are gettin' hitched again...      Afterwards we went to church and then to Coco's for a salad then about 3 hours later we went Olive Garden. There were about 25 people in our party. We had to wait about an hour and a half but the time flew by because we were all having a good time. I had the seafood alfredo and a beer, which isn't a good combo but I just felt like having a beer. Charles had stuffed ravioli... bleh it was aight. I like Caruso's much better.

      Saw the movie  urlLink Monster  last night. It was pretty good. Charlize Theron looked so different in this role as Molly said, "she was chunkie monkey". I found the following pics of her and the real Wournos.

      After work yesterday I went to the pizza joint and looked for the waitress. I asked the girl that was there and she said that the person I talked to left for the day.  Talked to the Manager and found out that he couldn't do anything either. So I left my contact information and headed home.   I got home changed and went to the gym then came home. I called the bank and they said they usually allot more funds for restaurant transactions because they never know if they leave a tip. I thougth it was wrong but oh well. After that I figured it was my bank. Charles and I started watching the movie Monster. Then I get a call from the owner of the pizza joint. He called an confirmed how much I was charged. So all is well. I may have over reacted a bit but oh well.

      Yesterday Dina, the kids, my mom and I went to a great pizza place by the UofA. So I paid for the dinner which was yummy. Plus it was only $37.61. I gave my card to my nephew, he went to the counter, signed the bill and then gave me my copy. My sis left a $6 tip. When I got home later, I gave Charles his pizza surprise. He loves the pizza from this place.  Later Charles is doing the checkbook and asked me what I spent $45.61 on. I told him the only place I used my debit card was the pizza joint. So after looking at the receipt and looking at the $45.61 online, I finally put the 2 and 2 together. They added 20% onto my bill. I couldn't believe it.   So I called the pizza place and told them that I ate there yesterday. Receipt says X my online statement says Y. I told them I wouldn't really make a big deal out of $7 but I left a cash tip and I like there food there but I don't think I could eat there again if this happened.  So lady on the phone said she would look for the receipt and I will meet up there later so we can talk about what happened. We shall see...

      Just wanted to make note a few of the things that make me happy. I was in the bathroom today and noticed how in one of the stalls they only have rolled toilet paper. In every other stall there is the tissue type of paper. I much prefer the tissue type dispensed paper. If toilet paper is rolled then it must... I repeat MUST BE PERFORATED. I hate it when it isn't.   The other item is a toilet seat cover that already has a cut and I don't have to tear the perforation. I know big deal about nothing, but then again is there anything that I discuss that is a big deal?

So I said you got a picture?   So she shows me a picture and the girl was ugly!!! I couldn't recover. I looked at my watch and said I had a meeting. I wanted to scream at her and say... WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH YOU?!!

      Friday... Went to the movies to see Day After Tomorrow. It was okay.   Saturday... Went to Nogales and picked up some Mexican Candy and some pastries. Charles and I went with Dina, my Mom, Abram, Asia and two other cousins (Linda and Ericka).   Sunday... We went to my cousin's house in the desert. It has to be one of the nicest homes in Tucson that I have ever seen. I'm sure it was about 3500 sq feet. It was just amazing. The view was spectacular. My cousin said it took two years to build the home. It gave Charles and me an idea that we need to buy land now so we can build a home later. I doubt that will happen.   Monday... I invited my Mom, Dina and the kids to come over to go swiming. Charles and I made Won Tons and shrimp with rice. It was deelish!

      I can't believe I'm up this early on a weekend. What gives? I couldn't sleep anymore... hrmf. Yesterday I talked to the hiring manager for the position that posted. It went great.  I felt really comfortable talking to her and bythe end of it it seemed like we were just finishing each other's sentences.  She is looking for someone to start in mid August. It looks promising.  In other news... Team member 'T' for school has been diligently working on the paper and I asked for team member 'C' to do week 4. She politely says, "sorry thought you knew. I dropped the class". Huh? 1) No I didn't know. 2) Thanks for the communication. Now each team in our class has 4 or more members except for us. We had three and now we are down to two.  It's okay since the team member 'C' didn't input much into the first paper anyway.

      Yesterday was such a great day.   First- I got all the turmoil from work resolved. I feel great about it because it was physically making me sick. I'm glad it is all behind me now.   Second- Got my tuition reimbursement check. Money, money, money, money,  MONEY!    Third- A new position at work&nbsp;that was rumored to open that&nbsp;I am reeealllly interested in&nbsp;finally posted. Keep ya informed on that one.   Fourth- After much deliberation, Charles and I went to the bank transferred some money and paid off my car. I still had about another 14 months to go... not no mo. Yay!   After we paid off my car we had a celebratory dinner at some Chinese food place.&nbsp; I was eating some General Tso's chicken. I was sure that I picked out all of the chili, but NOOOO! I ate one and it was the one of the worst things ever. My eyes started watering. My tongue was on fire. No amount of&nbsp;water, soda, pudding, ice or tongue scrapping&nbsp;helped. About 20 minutes later everything was okay but by that time, I couldn't even eat anything.&nbsp; Luckily the General Tso's chicken was the last thing left on my plate.

      Skipped the gym last night. Charles took me to go get some sushi. It was fabulous.&nbsp; We typically go to Bunbuku on Broadway. There was awhile there where we would go every Friday. Of course we get the same thing each time. It has been about 2 months&nbsp;since we last went but when we walked in she asked us if we wanted the same thing...&nbsp; she got&nbsp;a nice tip.   Afterwards we went to Target and Toys R Us and came out empty handed.

      Email correspondence with the big chuck (Denise)   Denise: Do you have the song Fantastic Voyage by Lakeside (Coolio did a remake of it)?   Me: I can get it. When do you need it by?  Denise: When you can. no big rush. People here at work didn't know it was a remake.  Me: WHAT?!! Blasphemy! Chuck you can not work under these conditions. What kind of savages are you working with? I suggest you quietly pack your bags. Tip-toe with your back facing the door and once you reach it, run like you have never ran before to your car and NEVER look back.

      Last night went to school. I think I have the ignoratory voice. (I'm not sure if that is even a word. Can you change the word ignore into an adjective? Oh well I like making up words.) So we get into a group exercise. Instructor lady had us count off by fours. Got in our group and discussed the exercise. I was talking to them and giving my input. I could have sworn they were listening cause I got the eye contact and a confirmation head nods.  About 2 seconds after I finished my input, another girl talks and says practically verbatim what I said. The reaction from the other members acted as if it were the first time ever they heard it... "That's a great idea", "Oh yeah I never considered that", "That's important because...". Bleh... oh well. I must have that type of voice that has the right combination of pitch, decibal, tone and some other characteristic that gets lost easily. I could never be a radio host.  After school, Charles did a short toy run to Wal-Mart and Big-K. I can easily see this turning into a routine after school.

      Yesterday after work I went home. Picked up Sugar and took her back to my parent's home. It was nice to the family. It was the first time I saw them since they were on vacation.   They got me some nice Dopey merchandise. I got a Dopey&nbsp;link for my Italian Charm bracelet and a Dopey charm for my charm bracelet.   I picked up some Eegee's later on, watched some tv and then headed home.   Hmmm... let me see. I also did some homework last night. Piece of cake. My group isn't as involved as I'd hoped. I sent them the paper on Sunday and did not hear back from them at all. I finally had to call them late last night and ask if the paper was okay... "yeah it's fine." Okay thank you for keeping the open lines of communication.  What I'm happy about is that I don't have to do another group paper. Now it is their turn... mwah ah ah ah. Who am I kidding? I know I am going to contribute. Damn this conscience of mine!!!

      Friday night Charles and I stayed home. Nothing new on the home front.   Saturday we went to my parent's house to water her jungle. That took about 90 minutes and then we were off to Phoenix to see Mercury play the Indiana Fever. Woo Woo! The game was great. They actually won! The score was 56 - 71. Ms. Hoffman didn't get playing time till second half. Plus D Taurasi was injured the first half so she did not play in the second half. Hrmf. I know she's off to play in the olympics and I must admit, I was really close to buying her USA jersey, but then it hit me. When will I wear this? I would probably buy it and have her autograph it... naawww doubt it. Here are some pics to document the road trip:   urlLink    Here are the ladies of Phoenix Mercury warming up before the big game.&nbsp; urlLink         urlLink    Here is Ebony (Big Dog) Hoffman # 34 running into position.&nbsp; urlLink          Oh and in case you're wodnering (which I doubt ya are) I didn't do a darn thing on Sunday and that was alright with me.

      After rescuing Sugar, her and I went back to my home. Charles made his fantastic world famous teriyaki chicken. Yummy. He popped in a movie he rented called  urlLink The Big Bounce . Yawn... I couldn't finish watching it. So went to the computer room and did some school stuff.      Charles said he was going to take the movie back and I hear the front door slam. Then I hear it open about 5 minutes later. He said my car is dead. WHAT?! My car was packed behind his, so we had to put my car in neutral and let it roll back so Charles had enough room to pull his car out. Gave my car a jump to get it going. Got it over to Auto Zone and mechanic, oil drenched, beer gut, guy says that my battery is dead... DUH! Thanks Earl. Charles changed the battery and we were on our way back home.

      Today after work I went to my parents' home. As I walk in I realize that they left the AC off... how dare they! I also look around and see that they set off some bug bombs. So it is hot as heck and I realize there was no air circulating since they have been gone.     When I look on one of the counters, there I see Geico's cage. I already knew what to expect. When I got closer my assumption was verified. There belly up in his cage was Geico. Poor little guy. My emotions got the best of me and I called my parents and told them they poisoned a harmless, innocent creature. They were still in Disneyland and I don't think they heard me... hrmf.      After the 2 hour watering marathon, I was able to leave. Since I didn't want Sugar (the family chihuahua) to meet her maker prematurely like good ole Geico, I brought her home with me.     Moment of silence for the sweet sweet Geico please.

      Thursday... only 1 more day left.    Yesterday the familia left for California. The folks and Dina and the kids all left yesterday about 3pm. One member that did stay behind was Sugar. My Dad wants her to stay at their house and I’m supposed to go to their home everyday to pick up the mail, water the plants and feed Sugar. They will be back on Sunday so it will only be four days.  Oh and I was given the task to set free Asia’s gecko, who she named Geico.      This Saturday is yet another exciting Phoenix Mercury game. I liked the last  urlLink Mercury game  I attended. This time they are supposed to be playing Indiana Fever.  urlLink Ebony Hoffman , a.k.a. Big Dog,  plays for Indiana Fever. She used to play for Narbonne High School in Harbor City, CA then later went to USC. According to Charles, she is really, really, really good. I would think since she did go 9th in the WNBA draft, that she was/is a good player. I’m sure I get to see her skills on Saturday.

      Last night's Sales Management class was decent. I had a headache but overall it was a okay. There's a student in class that has a French accent. I could probably listen to her talk all night long. She could have been reading the ingredients to toothpaste and I probably could have found it beautiful. I was tempted to ask her to say 'solid' like Claude (Hank Azaria) in  urlLink Along Came Polly .     Oh and the big mouth guy is still in class. Practically after every sentence the teacher said, he would comment. Each time after he spoke there were synchronized sighs.     Charles' class went well. He was so nervous heading in and afterwards he was excited. Awww I wish I still had that enthusiasm for school. With this week completed, I only have 14 more weeks and the enthusiasm has been long gone well before this class.

      On my MP3 player I have a playist that has many slow pop songs. I did this before I went to Montana in hopes that when I played it, I would fall asleep. It worked!! I also found that it works a little too well. I was listening to it at work and found my eyes closing.     Here are the songs that are on this playlist:     Mandy Moore - "Only Hope"   Mandy Moore - "Cry"   Nsync - "Gone"   Jojo - "Leave (Get Out)"   Justin Timberlake - "Never Again"   Mya - "If You Were Mine"   Mariah Carey - "Fourth of July"   Mariah Carey - "Melt Away"   Mariah Carey - "Underneath The Stars"   Mariah Carey - "When I Saw You"      So if you need some help sleeping try listening to these to zzzzzzzzzzz.

      Well another class begins. Joy. I am seriously getting burned out and find that my attention is dwindling.  &nbsp;    Charles is starting class tonight also. He was asking me all these questions about protocol. Awww he's so cute when he's nervous. He had me read his paper about 4 times to make sure it was okay. I should have directed him to this blog to show him examples of what not to do.  &nbsp;     Walking into work today, I noticed all these leaves on the ground. As I got closer they started jumping. Then I realized those aren't leaves at all but they were grasshoppers... or grasshoppa. It was disgusting because it was like a blanket of grasshoppers and each step I took more and more jumped. Good thing I wore pants instead of shorts today.

      Friday  Went over to the parental unit's casa. Played Mexican Train with Double 15s. The game took about 3 and a half hours to complete. By the end of it I was crowned the Queen of the Train... woowoo I won!    Saturday   I played Dynasty Warriors 3 for the longest time and then got ready. Charles and I went to Costco and Target. Bought  urlLink Digital Fortress  by Dan Brown. I'm still reading  urlLink The Dante Club  and find it hard to hold my attention. I'm going to stick to it though.    Sunday   I volunteered to help out with the audio visual team at church and I was supposed to 'shadow' someone so I could be shown the ropes. When I went to the observation room, high above the church, I was told the projector died. It was about time. The beast was about 16 years old. The church will be purchasing a new one this week. It will be nice to have some new technology.  After church, the parents, Dina and the kids, Charles and I went to go eat. I came home and played some more DW3. Asia was later dropped off so she could go to work with Charles today. I think this is his last week of the summer program... so he said that he would take Asia so she could play with some of the kids. Awww how sweet.

      or maybe not. I forgot to mention that while I was in Montana I read  urlLink Deception Point  by Dan Brown. I really enjoy his style of writing and the three novels,  urlLink Angels & Demons ,  urlLink The Da Vinci Code  and  urlLink Deception Point , have all been page-turners. I still need to read  urlLink Digital Fortress    Right now I'm reading  urlLink The Dante Club ... not quite as exciting but still managing to hold my attention. I'm hoping it will pick up a bit more.

      Charles and I went to the Scion dealership yesterday and we ordered ourselves a Scion xB model. It will be nice to get a new car. I know a lot of people don't like it but I think it is unique. Take a looksie...

      I got up early to get ready to take Denise to work. After dropping her off, I went to due some toy rounds but came out empty handed. Oh well.   I went back to the house so I could finish laundry and packing. Then about 2ish I picked up midget man from daycare. It was so beautiful spending some time with him and realized next time I see him he will be crawling. I can't wait to see what type of trouble he gets into.   With my bags all packed and Isaac securely fastened in his seat, I picked up Denise from work at 3:30. She stayed with me in the airport for awhile and about 15 minutes before the plane boarded I passed security.    While waiting to board I was listening to the soothing sounds of No Doubt's "Don't Speak" except it was done in elevator music format. When I arrived in Billings, MT, I noticed they had the same type of music playing. This time it was "Rapper's Delight"... I wish I would have recorded some. It would have been hysterical.  Billings to Las Vegas was fine. Las Vegas to Tucson was okay except that we boarded about 90 minutes later than we were supposed to. Charles I'm sure is hating life today because he got about 3-4 hours of sleep to last him throughout the day.

      Sunday we went on a float. The water must have been in the 60s brrrr. Denise and I went and battled a bit o' white water. Okay not much because we were on inner tubes but we got splashed quite a few times. I saw a water snake and it fer-eeeked me out. I panicked because I'm deathly afraid of snakes. I think the rest of the way I kept my butt out of the water.    After the float we picked up some grub and went back to the house. It was a nice way to end my Montana trip.

      Well it is true... I accomplished one of my goals in life. I have a favorite arcade game called Star Wars Trilogy. One of my goals was to score high enough to actually input my initials into the freaking game. Yesterday when I went to the mall in beautiful Missoula, I went to the CyberArcade. Imagine my surprise when I saw they had my game and my complete excitement when I saw it was only 2 tokens to play... yay!    When all was said and done the game ended and I was getting ready to get up and tada... it had the infamous prompt for initials. Before I go back to Tucson I have to try playing the game again because I am not going to settle for 49th place (out of 50). After entering my initials I knew the day was going to be great.

      Yesterday Denise, Isaac and I went to the mall. I spotted out some stuff that I want to buy and with no sales tax I'm all over it.   In the evening, Denise and I went to Sean Kelly's for dinner and we met some of her friends. Every Tuesday night they have quiz night. There are several teams that compete for what I'm not sure... I guess just bragging rights. It was a lot of fun. I laughed, I cried, I drank a couple of Fat Tires and I was set. It was great meeting some of Denise's friends. They are great people.

      Last night I went to work with Denise. We showed up about 9pm. While she worked, I wrote my paper for class. The time went by quick and at about 1245am, Denise ashed me if I wanted to see the press. It was amazing. We walk down a couple flights of stairs and she opens two double metal doors. There were hundreds of stacks of spooled paper. If one were to fall it would smask anything in its path. As we walk through this maze of spooled paper I hear some type of loud rumbling and it got louder and louder. Finally I saw the press. It was amazing. It was printing the day's edition of the paper. This machine was just massive in everyway. I had seen it before on a trip, but never got to see it in action.

      Sunday was the big day... Flying from Tucson to Phoenix was fine. Flying from Phoenix to Boise was fine. When I landed in Boise I had to switch airlines since the carrier I was flying didn't fly directly to Missoula. No big deal. I went to the carrier and checked in and then got my board pass. As we got the boarding call I looked out the window and only saw a small plane with two propellers and that’s it. I thought surely we are walking to one of the bigger planes… nope. That plane was ours.   So I walk from the boarding gate down to the prop plane. After being greeted by the co-pilot and I climbed up into the plane and my heart immediately started to race. There were only two single rows of seats. I’m awful at writing descriptions but imagine a metal lawn chair bolted down to some wood and to make sure it looks somewhat presentable it is covered by some dirty berber carpet. That was the main cabin of this plane.    After climbing finding my lawn chair… I mean seat, the main cabin door was closed. Once the propellers started the whole plane started to vibrate. I thought for sure that I would be diggin’ my fingers into the seat in front of me but once we got in the air, I was out. I think the combination of the vibration from the propellers and the comfort of the chair put me to sleep. Before I knew the 70 minute flight went by and I was in Missoula.

      Saturday we went to go eat dinner for my grandfather's 80th birthday. It was nice to see him and my grandma. Afterwards I went to pick up the dogs, and drop them off at my parents house. They are going to watch Bo and Pixie for me until Charles gets back on Tuesday.  After I dropped the dogs at their grandma's house, I went home to pack. I got home about 7:30, did a couple of loads of laundry, washed the dishes, mopped the floor, folded the clothes and then started packing... packing... packing. I was packing my suitcase and vanity case and then I just happened to get up and look at the clock and it said 12:30am... eeek! I had to get up at 4am so my dad could take me to the airport.  I quickly finished packing and then went to bed.

      Ahhhhh. The extended night's rest was much appreciated. I must have been running on fumes for that past few days. It was not fun at all.   Prior to going to bed Charles called me up to let me know he was going to see some hip-hop orchestra (I didn't know it was possible either). I asked him to call me when he gets home from the show to let me know he got home safely (such a mom I know). Went to bed about 9:30 last night and I woke up this morning about 7ish. I was upset because Charles didn't call me so I decided I would wait for his call.   He called me about 9:45 and the conversation went something like:    Him- Hello.  Me- Hi. How come you didn't call?  Him- ::chuckle:: How did you sleep?  Me- Hmmmm fine I guess but why didn't you call me?   Him- I did about 11 and you were talking to me, thanked me for calling and thanked me for waking you up.    As he was talking I looked at my received calls "Charles: 10:53pm". Now I know the lack of sleep dangers... I wonder if anyone else called and I made some outrageous promise.     "Sure you can have my big toe. I have another one"  "Who do I make my check out to?"

      I can't believe I am already at work right now. I just dropped off Charles at the airport for his 6am flight to LA. He will be back on Tuesday.    Last night we went to my parent's home. They are back from Montana finally! I got my Black Cats and couldn't wait to light some off. Abram and Asia had quite the assortment of fireworks. As soon as it was dark out Abram, Asia and I ventured to the backyard. I set off some Black Cats and it was greeeat! Boom, boom, boom! Then while Abram was lighting some of his Roman Candles, I lit Asia's sparklers. Then all of a sudden I hear Abram say 'Whooooa!' I look up and I see a trail of smoke and then all of a sudden... BOOM! It was like the fireworks for 4th of July. After that we quit because we got in trouble. Abram from my dad and me from Charles.

      So as you now know I went to see Spiderman in the early morning hours of Wednesday. So that day I was running on about 4 hours sleep. I will never do that again. I was physically sick on Wednesday. I was at work about 8:30ish in la manana (I think that means in the morning). I was okay until about 1030-11. I started feeling lightheaded and I thought I was going to puke. Eating something was out of the question because just the thought of any food type was making me gag. I couldn't eat anything until the evening. I am such a lightweight. I guess I need my beauty sleep to function somewhat normal. I do use the term 'normal' loosely of course.

      Last night Charles and I had to drive to the Scion dealership to pick up the mats for the xB. I think I will just start calling it the box that rox.  After that we battled the huge demons at CostCo. I found out where Charles and I will be buying our lunches/dinners from when we retire. If your hungry after eating the buffet of samples (if they have them), go to the food court. I had a hotdog and soda for 1.50! Yay!  Afterwards we went home and I did laundry and cleaned for the arrival of Jan, Chuck and Matthew (Charles mom, dad and brother). I haven't seen them for awhile.

      Last night's class was smooth EXCEPT when they had to pick teams for a game of Jeopardy. There were three captains and it was like 3rd grade kickball. In elementary school I was always the first one picked for any sport. How things change so quickly. I was picked last for this game. Oh well. I answered a lot of the questions so who's stupid now? I'm I bitter? NO!  In other news Charles' parents are coming tonight from California. I'm glad because I haven't seen them for awhile. I will have Friday off... hip hip hooray for the 3 day weekend.

I don't know all the rules of pig latin. If I remember correctly each word ends in either yay or ay. I found a site that offers some of the  urlLink basic rules :   For words which begin with a single consonant take the consonant off the front of the word and add it to the end of the word. Then add ay after the consonant. Here are some examples:   cat = atcay   dog = ogday   simply = implysay   noise = oisnay      For words which began with double or multiple consonants take the group of consonants off the front of the word and add them to the end, adding ay at the very end of the word. Here are some examples:   scratch = atchscray   thick = ickthay   flight = ightflay   grime = imegray      For words that begin with a vowel, just add yay at the end. For example:   is = isyay    apple =appleyay   under = underyay

      Yesterday I got to drive the Scion to work. Yay! Today I am driving my Altima. I realize that I have to clean the girl up. Charles did some work by steam cleaning the carpets for me and now I have to give her a good wash.  In other news, tonight is class. I'm so ready for this school bit to be over. It will free up some more of my time to do other more important things like play PS2, sleep, etc. Speaking of school, Abram starts high school next week. He is going to be a Badger, like me, his mom, his nina, my mom and my dad. I think my grandfather went there too, but I may be mistaken. I offered to pick him up the first day of school... in the Scion of course.

      Yesterday my mom dropped us off at the Scion dealership about noon. We were helped by the Scion Manager and got paper work ready to give to Finance. While we were waiting, the General Manager of that Toyota dealership came over and introduced himself and made sure everything was okay. About 10 minutes later the Finance Manager came over to help us out.  After we signed our lives away, we checked out the car and noticed it didn't have any floor mats (we thought we ordered them) so off to the parts department and we ordered the mats and then ordered the metal door sill protectors.   We left the dealership in our new car about 1:30. An hour and a half went by quick. Charles got to drive the car most of the day and I drove it home. I get to drive it tomorrow to work. Yay!  I loved looking at the reaction of people when we were driving the car. They ranged from utter disgust to raised eyebrows and smiles. It's okay, Charles and I like it and that's what is important. Take a look and you be the judge.     urlLink    Here's the driver's side of the xB  urlLink         urlLink    Here's the passenger side of the xB&nbsp; urlLink         urlLink    Here's the back of the xB.  urlLink

      I couldn't sleep anymore. I am way too excited! Yesterday while Charles and I were shopping, the Scion Manager called and said our car was in! Yay!!  Mucho excited. We have to pick up the car today. We are driving my car over to my parent's house and my mom is taking us to the dealership so we can both drive in it on the way home. Stay tuned for more pictures.  Last night Charles and I did some shopping. Went to JCPenney's at Tucson Mall and bought about 8 shirts, several pairs of socks, and a couple pairs of shorts. After leaving the mall we went to eat Sushi at Shogun... yummy. Then we headed over to Park Place and bought four pairs of shoes. Charles bought himself 2 pairs of Adidas shoes and for me two pairs of Converse. I bought the navy blue with red on the inside and red with mustard yellow on the inside. While we were at the mall I got to see handsome.  Oh yeah I forgot to mention we went to Toys R Us and Charles bought me Sonic's Mega Collection (it has 7 games) for Gamecube. I love it! As soon as I got home I started to play it. I was amazed at all the secret passage ways I remembered.  Ahhhh the good ole days.

      Yesterday after work I happened to visit my parent's house. It was great spending time with my Midget Woman and Handsome. I was bouncing them both on my lap such cuties.  When I finally got home Charles said that he called the Scion Manager and she said they got a truck in last night. We are hoping our Scion xB is on that truck. But so far... I haven't heard back. We are both hoping that we will be driving our new car this weekend.  Charles has today off. I will probably be leaving work early today... I'm all caught up.  I went to the cafeteria to break-da-fast. I went to get my usual Crystal Light but I took a drink and YUCK! It tasted funky and then I smelled it which was a big mistake... I started gagging. So I threw it out and told the cafeteria lady and got a free Sprite.

      Yesterday for lunch we went to this steak house called Cattletown. I had one of the best French Dips I have ever had. It was deee-lish. I would have to say the French Dip is by far one of my favorite sandwiches.  After work I went to the gym. While I was on the treadmill, this girl gets on one next to me. Well not right next to me but the one next to the next of me. Okay.. she was two treadmills down... anyway. After being on the treadmill for about 15 minutes, she wiped her brow with the back of her hand and shook it off... something unforgivable happened next. A few drops landed on my arm... I immediately felt my throat swell. I was already gagging and knew I had to get out of there quick before I puked. I went to the bathroom to wash my arm, got a drink of water and then some fresh air.  After that whole ordeal, I went back and worked on arms and back.  After the gym, went back to the house and showered. Watched  urlLink 13 Going On 30 , bleh wasn't as cute as I thought it would be.  After watching the movie, I played some DW3. I have to get a new game.

      Last night's class started off with the same noise coming from the big mouth guy. I think the instructor's last nerve could no longer bear the weight of this annoyance. It was quite apparent that the instructor saying something like 'thank you for your insightful commentary after every sentence, we are all truly blessed to have you present' had an impact on him because big mouth guy was silent the rest of the class. I was celebrating internally and knew that others were doing the same. I have a feeling that next week's class he would be up to his old antics. I can only hope that the beast will be silent next week. Only hope and pray.  By the way... only 12 more class sessions left. Yay for me!

      I had a bit of time to kill today. Inspired by Molly's search for her name, I did the same. Mine wasn't as nice as her's...  Turns out that the  urlLink 'Fake Delisa'   is a criminal in Victoria County in Texas. When I look at the list of possible offenses, the Fake Delisa's is FTA (Failure To Appear). I guess that isn't so bad. ::sigh:: Oh well.

         Friday  - We had a team offsite at a place called  urlLink Bedroxx . First ball I threw was a strrrriiiiike! After that it went downhill. I left the bowling alley and came back to work because I had a meeting with the hiring manager. It was grrrreat! After the meeting Charles and I went to see  urlLink The Village ... I was disappointed.   Saturday  - Went back to Bedroxx for a family birthday party. It was fun but yet again, I sucked.  Afterwards we played pool and then went to the movies to see  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy . The movie was good except there was a car chase scene where it seemed to drag on foe-ev-ah. I also learned one important fact... Julia Stiles looks awful in a turtle neck sweater and should really consider firing her stylist. If I could see how bad she looked in it then come on.   Sunday  - Went to church then back to the house and then to work.    Other than that nothing else to report.
