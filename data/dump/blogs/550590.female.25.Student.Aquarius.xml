      Look at the cover to the new Revolver magazine:     I can't believe all the awesome bands that are on Ozzfest this year. It's ridiculous. And I know all of the people on the cover (and in a perfect world you would too), that's how sick it is.  Judas Priest, Ozzy (Sabbath), Hatebreed, Superjoint Ritual, Slayer, Lamb of God, Lacuna Coil, Black Label Society, Slipknot - insane. Dimmu Borgir weren't at the shoot I guess.  My new favorite band of the week:  Devil Doll  Theatrical Italian prog-metal soundtrack music.

Okay, enough gushing for one night. :)

      Today, boys and girls, we have learned that just because you're cute, doesn't mean you're a good daddy.  &nbsp;  Bruce didn't even know how to spell Snoelle's name until about a minute ago. Does that qualify as child abuse? Can you imagine the police report if she ever ran away? "so, tell me, sir, how do you spell your daughter's name?" "uh...I'm not sure. You'll have to ask her mother. I just come over to pull her paws and meow back at her..."  &nbsp;  And then I remember that they're cats and dogs and that this is crazy lady talk. I'm going to bed now. :)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  urlLink

      I hope you all had a blessed Easter (I say this realizing that most of you who actually read this are Jewish or Athiests...)  God, I'm exhausted--and I shouldn't be--I really didn't do much if anything this weekend.  I think Mom said it best: I get sleepy when I'm bored.  Watched Hearts in Atlantis and The Fast and the Furious this weekend.  The first was as good as to be expected--Anthony Hopkins is amazing.  I would want to have his children if he weren't halfway in his grave.  The latter didn't have much in the way of substance--kind of like Point Break meets Gone In 60 Seconds, but it was fun to look at.  I love beautiful men.  Rawwwwr.  This afternoon I went to Elyse's house to discuss wedding stuff and get the third degree about the job hunt from others there.  It was a little annoying, but added to my motivation to get the hell out of Florida asap.  Everyone seems to think I'm nuts for wanting to live somewhere with seasons and cold weather.  Florida has just been such a disappointment in so many aspects: I really think a chance of location is long overdue at this point.  Well, I'm off to apply for more jobs, seeing as I've promised my dad I wouldn't bank on the Pennsylvania thing and I'm a little skeptical of living so close to the Amish...(sp?)  Well, only God knows.  Just keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I keep you all in mine.

      Fasting is exhausting.  I vacuumed my parents house and had to take a 3 hour nap on the couch before dinner.  Fun with Good Friday.  I just keep telling myself: Only 2 more days and then I can eat all the cheese and watch all the tv I want! :)  I was finally able to get in touch with the lady about the Court Liason job in Southeast Pennsylvania today...very exciting...No real news to report yet, but let's put it this way: I had to consult a former professor about the ethical dilemma of bailing on my practicum students for summer.  Hopefully next week I'll know something definite either way. Until then, I'm content to look for apartments in Reading, PA.  3 Hours from D.C., 3 hours from NYC...joy.  Much better than 14 or 20 hours.  Still trying to sell the green chairs and the rugs if anyone is interested.  Someone please buy them.  They're comfy and dogs love to sit on them.  More to come.  For now I'm going to take another nap...I'm exhausting from eating a huge dinner to make up for the nourishment I lacked all day.

      Lots of job related news to report...  Today we hosted the Florida State Association of Teen Courts meeting and Jason neglected to tell me that he had moved the meeting up (grumble, grumble) so people had already started showing up with I strolled into the office thinking I would have time to grab coffee and check my email before everyone arrived.  Found out that Orange County Teen Court is basically desperate for employees (the letter is going out in the morning mail.)  I think I'm literally the youngest person to ever have a Teen Court job and the old bats that run the majority of the programs definitely look at me as a young kid who doesn't know what she's talking about for the most part.  I smiled, and kept my mouth shut and was just happy to be hopefully leaving the state sometime in the very near future.  I got a job phone call today from someone in a juvenile treatment facility in Southeast Pennsylvania: 2.5 hours from Washington, D.C.  Hopefully she'll call me back on Friday when I'm at home not eating or doing much of anything (ahh...Catholicism at it's finest.)  I wanted to give my notice today (or at least this week) to make sure that Jason had enough time to hire someone else before I leave at the end of July, but my father called me frantic when my mother told him.  He thinks that I will get fired if I tell them now that I'm leaving in 4 months.  I doubt it.  It will take them at least 4 months to find someone decent to replace me and then they've gotta hire someone part time on top of that!  I really want to make sure that the program will be left in good hands when I leave because it is way too big for anyone to run by himself.  It's way too big for only 2 people...  Incidentally apparently the Orange County Teen Court program has a 1.2 MILLION dollar budget!!  What is THAT about?  We had the smallest budget by far of any program at the meeting today, but I bet none of them have their masters and are making 20 grand a year.  Sheesh.  What the hell was I thinking?  Oh, that's right...that I was poor...way to get myself out of THAT situation!!  But the good news is that the garage sale stuff is going fast!  Get your butt to  urlLink The Sale   and check it out before you miss your chance.  This was literally the best idea I've had in a while...I highly recommend you host an internet garage sale if you want to sell your crap.  People will literally fight over a breadmaker...it's kinda funny  Tomorrow I get to present what I have gleaned as an adolescent counselor to the people that are in my Master's Program now.  (one word for you, kids: Sedatives)

      Busy, busy day.  Interviewed 2 more practicum students for summer semester.  Now I'm going to have 4 interns--maybe 5 depending on if that last one decides to turn in her paperwork.  Then it's off to bigger and better things.  I'm telling Jason on Friday.  He's either gonna kill me or start crying.  The Garage Sale is going well: The dishes, entertainment center, and cappuccino maker are off the market.  I may auction the breadmaker, everyone seems to want it.  I didn't have time to go sell my clothes today.  That will have to wait since tomorrow is the Florida Association of Teen Courts meeting and we're hosting.  I'm gonna ask Mr. H if I can temp for him in the fall until I get a job up north.  I'm jubilantly terrified of my decision to finally get the hell out of Florida.  For the first time in my entire life, I've no idea what my plans are, where I'm going, how I'm going to live.  It's more exciting than anything I've done in a long time...you know, since I stopped smoking crack and all. :P  Time to eat and call Elyse anad make plans for my trip up north.   urlLink Buy my shit!!

      Okay so you may be saying to yourself "hmm...why is Danielle selling all her crap?"  Answer: Because the less crap I have to move this summer, the better.  Oh, that's right, here's the big moment you've all been waiting for:                     DANNIE'S GETTING THE HELL OUT OF FLORIDA!!!  So this is the plan...at least for now:             April 12-17th: Kick ass and take names at the National Youth Court Conference in D.C. Kinkos is my new best friend.  I'm about to go make 1000 copies of my various resumes.  :)             May 3-13th: Go to Connecticut and scout out jobs, go to NYC and be the good bridesmaid and get fitted for what I hope will be a tasteful dress...Elyse definitely looked better than me at prom, so hopefully her taste hasn't changed that much in the past 6 years.             July 21st: Elyse's wedding in Long island.  Some time either before or after begin moving my crap into storage somewhere in New England.             July 31st: My lease ends and I leave Gainesville...for good, with the exception of a reunion or two...  Please keep me in your prayers and thoughts, folks.  As of right now, I'm leaving without having a job to go to which is by far the most ballsy, scariest thing I have ever done.  At least I have my parents approval now...even if they can't support me financially (thus, the internet garage sale.)  Pictures of stuff for sale to follow once my digital camera batteries finish charging.  Movin' on up, to the Northeast side....

      sleepy and unmotivated to complete the weekend's only task.  It's an issue at this point of knowing where to start and getting my asshole cousin to leave the house.  Came home to find my $12 bottle of conditioner that I had used only twice two-thirds gone in the guest bathroom.  Loafing bastard...Adding that on to the list of ammo I will eventually use as leverage for a temporary place to live in Connecticut in August.  Had lunch with Thomas at Farrah's today and attempted to talk him into getting tattoos at the seedy place across the street where we parked.  We really need to start spending more than 1 hour every 3 months together.  This time I had to rush back to Orlando for my grandmother's memorial and palm sunday mass.  One would think that 16 years would be enough time for the anger to subside.  Not so much.  Well, sitting here staring blankly at the screen listening to Frank's roaring snore tells me that I'm about out of things to say for now.  More after I have "the talk" (not the sex talk, that should have happened YEARS ago) with my parents.  Wish me luck. :)

      UGH...  People say they don't understand why my job is so stressful...  Imagine the most horrible, wretched things you would want to say to your parents when you were in middle school, combined with the worst act you ever thought you could commit at that age, add the ego of your middle/high school's star quarterback or homecoming queen and multiply it times 50 children.  That is what my Thursday is like...then there are the other 4 days of the week.  Jason asked me tonight if I was happy with where I am in my career.  I responded with an unconvincing "sure."  Sigh.  What a mess my life is becoming.  Another 3 airlines followed suit today.  Now there's only 2 domestic airlines and the international airlines that are giving commission to the travel agents.  Please write a letter if you haven't yet.  Eventually I'll post a way you can email the airlines, too...not that they care.  I'm extra bitter tonight, it's been a long day, and this weekend will probably be mildly to moderately stressful and emotional, too.  Please AIM me if you get a chance.  I need a good cheering/morale boost.

      Thank you all so much for responding to my email/blog about my mom's job.  She's taking your response and posting them up on her office window as well as providing copies to anyone who would like to send an email themselves.  My mom was so thrilled...not only for your emails, but also because she finally figured out tonight how to make smiley faces on AIM.  A celebration was had by all...we're cheering for small victories at this point.  Apparently my email is getting around, too.  Mom got an email tonight from the woman who served as her travel agent when she and my dad were planning their honeymoon.  Speaking of honeymoons, Elyse Berger is getting married.  All bets are off on this one.  She, Aaryn and I thought for sure that I would be the 1st of the 3 to get married.  Looks like I'm gonna just have to settle for being a bridesmaid instead.  Not nearly as depressing as I thought it would be.  I'm not certain there's anyone in my life right now I would consider husband material, and I've certainly got bigger plans right now than finding a husband.  And speaking of plans...hmm...I'll probably wait until after this weekend to post this one.  If you want to know before then, ask me and I'll either tell you the truth or make up some really entertaining story.  After all, I'm a two-faced hypocritical backstabber...or so the potheads would have you believe.    But seriously, who's not two faced?  If you've ever answered "How are you" with "I'm good" when you were feeling shitty or talked about a friend or co-worker after making certain they were out of earshot, aren't you two faced?  Please, spare me the "you're such a horrible person and we don't like you" speeches, folks.  If you don't like me, quit reading my blog and don't talk to me anymore.  I assure you it won't bother me in the least bit. What does bother me are people who can talk shit but can't take it in return.  That and people that don't admit they're hypocrites.  We all are on some level.  The real hypocrites are those who can't admit it.  Anyway, thanks to those of you who wrote on my family's behalf.  Those of you who haven't, please take the five minutes to do so.  I've provided you with all the info you need on this site.  All you need is to point, click, cut, and paste.  Sweet dreams and goodnight.

      Most of you reading this have gotten the email by now (and I hope have responded to it in some way, shape or form) but if not here it is for your viewing pleasure.  PLEASE do what you can--even if all you can do is forward it on to other people.  Hey all,   I know I usually bombard you all with worthless surveys, generally unentertaining spam, and invitations to parties but this is actually something really important to me, and I hope you'll take the time to read it and forward this on to at least 1 person that you know as it effects us all in one way or another.   As you may not know, the brilliant airlines in our nation have decided that in order to save money they're going to stop paying commissions to travel agents.  That basically means that unless something is done quickly and we bombard Washington with emails or whathaveyou that my mom and many other people like her are going to lose their jobs.  It is impossible for a travel agency to stay open when the majority of their business is plane tickets and selling plane tickets doesn't make them any money.   So here's what ya need to do.  In this email I've included links to the email addresses or directories for the president, vice president, senate, and house.  I've also included a modified version of the email that I sent to President Bush not even 5 minutes ago.  All you need to do is cut and paste my email to an email you send to them and you can go about your life.  It will only take 5 minutes.  And don't give me that crap about not having the time.  After all, you've had at least 1 minute to sit here and read this.  If you're getting this because you've traveled with a debate team or because my mom has booked you a flight somewhere or because you are my friend and eventually you want me to come visit you, please, please PLEASE send this to at least one of the people I've included on this list.  If ya do, I promise I might not never send you spam again.  Thanks for listening.  Love you all.   Dannie     To email President George W. Bush   president@whitehouse.gov   To email Vice President Richard Cheney   vice.president@whitehouse.gov   To locate contact information for your Senator   http://www.senate.gov/                   For Florida: http://graham.senate.gov/email.html  or http://billnelson.senate.gov/contact/index.cfm   To locate your Representative   http://www.house.gov/writerep/wyrfaqs.htm#listrep     Dear Mr. President,  I was both disheartened and concerned during the past week or so to hear of our airlines' decision to discontinue the practice of paying commissions to travel agents on airline tickets.  As the friend of an extraordinary travel agent who works many long days (including many late evenings and weekends) serving both businesses and families in our community, I firmly believe that there are repercussions to this decision that the airlines may not have considered carefully enough.    As I'm certain you know, travel agents are extremely important to the travel and tourism industry in our nation for a multitude of reasons.  An article in Travel Weekly published September 24, 2001 points out, in a year-long study of our nations' travelers, 81% of participants utilized a travel agency when planning any air trip, either business or leisure.  The study went on to point out that agency users take significantly more trips, travel more often by air, spend more money when they travel and are also more likely to hold passports.  It is difficult to imagine how travel agencies in our nation can continue to operate if they are spending so much time planning trips from which they will reap little or no benefit.  A majority of the business many travel agencies conduct involves plane tickets.  My friend, a travel agent for nearly a decade, told me recently, while trying not to cry in the middle of her office, that she was in the process of planning a flight for 45 people and another trip for 20 people from which she would yield not even 1 dollar in profit.  How can an agency afford to pay their office rental, their employees, or the fees they must pay in order to utilize travel network services when they are spending time fulfilling their customers needs for nothing?  It is virtually impossible for most travel agencies to plan travel without booking flights.  Mr. President, it seems to me that while you were doing your best to help the airlines cope with the fall out from the September 11th tragedy, they've taken your generosity and used it as an opportunity to punish the industry that has helped them in a way no one else can, by providing them with consistent customers.  The week after September 11th, my friend was on the phone every day, convincing customers that they should not cancel their flight arrangements for business trips, the holidays and the new year because she had faith in our Government.  While some customers were not willing to listen, many of them did because they trusted their travel agent who was not only a business partner but a loyal and honest friend.  I'm writing, Mr. President, as not only a vicarious member of the Travel Industry, but also as a customer of that industry, a government employee, and a citizen of what I am certain is the strongest and most industrious nation to have ever existed, to ask you to please not let these hard-working, patriotic Americans fall to the wayside the way the airlines have.  The airlines need these agents more than they realize. 5,334 out of every 6500 customers wouldn't travel without them.  Mr. President, I thank you for your availability to the people, for your determination and sleepless nights during this time of national tragedy and war, and for being someone the people of this nation can count on.  God bless you and your family, and God Bless America.  Sincerely and gratefully,  Danielle C. Malo, MHS, CRC,  Alachua County Sheriff's Office  Gainesville, FL

      God, what a hectic day.  National Youth Court Conference craziness everywhere I turn, Communications was all over my ass about who was emailing me about the Sheriff's Office "intelligence", I had to deal with the fallout of yesterday's anger management group catastrophe, there's always fun when DCFS is involved, the travel industry is officially going to hell, the drama of the cell phone curse continues, and I am still awaiting the day when I walk into an Intake Interview and both the parent and the child accept and admit responsibility for their actions.  Jeez.  A gigantic SPLAT could be heard in my apartment last night around 10:30 or so.  That was when the shit hit the fan regarding the email I sent to the debate list.  "Blah blah blah, let's make personal attacks on Danielle because on some subconscious level we know she's right, blah blah blah."  Now Bo wants me kicked off the list because I cursed.  Hmm...what's that it says in SG rules about not being under the influence of illict substances whilst a member of an SG funded organization?  Hmmm....  In all honesty, the comments of the teammates really are more amusing than anything else.  They would be more incindiary were they from people who actually knew me now.    They do however cause me to contemplate what my life would be like if I actually gave a shit about what the groundlings thought of me...hmm...nah, far too much work, bullshitting and false niceities for me.  I'd rather be hated than adored.  It's much easier to fall off a pedestal.

      2nd post in 1 hour?  I know, I know, I'm nuts.  Actually I'm just procrastinating because I don't want to get up off my ass and do my kickboxing.  It's much more fun to just watch the DVD from the couch while eating ice cream.  Well, a lot of you know that I gave up tv for lent.  Not the best idea seeing as I don't have time (or use the time I have) to pick up the newspaper.  It has led to comments such as:                "Hey, did you see the preview for that--" "No."               "What?  Rosie O'Donnell came out?"               "What do you mean hot spots?"               "What NCAA tournament?"  So for the next two weeks, quit askin be if I saw this or watched that or if I want to come over and watch Dawson's Creek (sadist bitches.)  And don't you dare offer me cheese to compensate!!

      First thing's first: Congratulations to Lauren for kicking Informative ass.  "I hate my speech, it's terrible."  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah....  And now it's time for updates from the weekend:  1) It was WONDERFUL to see all the Alumni again.  Nice to know that some things don't change.  Eggers is still spacey, Josh still says "Dude!" and "SHUT UP!" all the time, and Sully is still his adorable self.    2)It was also fun introducing Rebecca to people she already knows.  I'm gonna bleach my hair, get all skinny and start competing for a North Eastern school.  See you all at nationals.  3) The teammates still piss me off...well, most of them.  I just sent off a nasty rant to the list-serv and probably made about 20 enemies in about 10 minutes.  This was months of repressed rage being expelled from my mind...well worth the five minutes of eye rolling and bitching they'll do about me in the long run.  4) judging debate is exhausting.  I judged 6 straight rounds on Saturday.  Competing wasn't nearly as exhausting: At least then I got to move and I didn't have to think of something nice to say about downright wretched performances.  5) God bless Kellie for putting up with all the shit I tried to pull when I was on the team.  I can't imagine how she puts up with the  bullshit now.  When did debate stop being about debate and start being about the weekends off?  Jesus.  I think I'll write again when I have something nice to say...not about the team because then it would probably be a good month or so.  In the meantime I'll go back to thinking sweet thoughts about a tall, dark, handsome man from Tampa.  RAWR.  "So, what team are  you  on?"

      Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you.  Well, the plane tickets have been mailed out and I am on my way to D.C. exactly 30 days from today.  Yippee.  I get to spend almost a week out of Florida and I don't have to pay for ANYTHING--not even meals while I'm gone.  So for those of you in the Washington area, I'll be arriving around 1:30 into Regan National on April 12th (a Friday) and expect to party down on Friday night, sleep in on Saturday and then the conference starts on Monday.  Yay!  My computer is officially virused out.  I had to restart the damn thing 5 times tonight and I've only been up from my power nap for about 45 minutes.  I woke up and thought it was morning and that I was late for work.  Teehee.  Would have really SUCKED for my dogs if it were in fact morning, because it would mean they hadn't been out in 14 hours.    So Rob is awesome (as you all already know) and disturbingly generous and has offered to add a "discuss" feature to my journal.  I want to eventually learn to do it myself, but until then I'm forever indebted to him and will judge all the parli rounds he needs me to judge at DSR this weekend.  Even if it's crappy TCC or Carson Newman (Carson-Newman has parli, wtf?--still shocked over a year later) Parli.  Well, more when there's more to say.  Eventually the  urlLink Words  site will be updated and the poll topic is out and about.  (New themes for my website for those of you who didn't get the memo.)  Mad props goes out to Juddddd who gave quite witty responses and to Thomas who is always the first to respond.  Mwah! to both of you.  Das ist das for now.  Tootles!

      Ah the irony of the guitar continues I promised myself that I wasn't going to play with it until I did my kickboxing since I've been a total slacker and haven't worked out for a week and a half, but you all know me with what my father has deemed my need for instant gratification.  (He clearly has NO concept of what I put up with every day.)  I had to open the box and at least tune it before I worked out.  So I'm tuning the guitar (keep in mind I haven't held a guitar for more than 10 minutes in my entire life) and on the last string, it breaks.  Just snaps right in my face as if that's God's way of saying "See?  Told you you should have worked out, fatass."  Well, David says that on Thursday he's going to stop hanging out with the 16 year old long enough to teach me how to fix it, and maybe play a cord or two.  We'll see.  I don't know where that boy's priorities are.  (Nookie.)  What I do know is that he could do much better...I don't know what she looks like, but the voice is annoying as a certain basenji bugging me to let her out at 5am on the only day of the week I get to sleep in.   Rob is my new internet guru and I'm going to make what I'm sure will be a failed attempt at html code  urlLink here   we'll see if it actually works.  Lots of new updates to come.  Kimmie switched her whole website to blogger, but that's far too much computer geekage for me.  html is dandy, but geocities is quicker...the need for instant gratification rears it's ugly head.

      So my guitar got delivered today except I wasn't here so no one could sign for it.  Of course, it was delivered at 6:30, so I SHOULD have been home, but alas the Power Point for the National Youth Court Center Presentation is due on Monday and I'm still kind of treading water hoping that someone else will magically agree to write it for me (Shawn?  Avi? I would say Thomas, but we all know the boy can't spell.)  Had my 6 month review today...Jeez, can you believe I've been doing this job for 6 months?  To this day I've made less than Thomas has made since January.  But I'm not bitter...much.   Still no luck posting links because I still lack the motivation to learn HTML.  Had an IM today for the first time since, oh, mid January from our good buddy Voldemort.  Today was a mildly productive day at work, but I still want to hide my head in the sand, stay at home and be a student skipping class again.  For those of you still in school, don't ever go out into the real world.  It's a horrible, horrible place.  At least in school you're miserable but you can be drunk and miserable.  Being drunk at work will only get you fired.  Then you're drunk and miserable and poor.  Okay, I'm gonna go try to be productive now.  But feel free to AIM me and tell me that my blogger journal is SO cool and that you miss me lots.  Write me poetry.  That would REALLY impress and cheer me up.  But don't make it rhyme.  Then you'll be a loser poet.  And nobody likes a loser.

      Hurray for Blogger!  (Thanks, Rob).  No more ghetto rigging my webjournal...of course, now I have to figure out how to include links and whatnot because I know you all would be crushed if I could no longer make fun of other people's websites in my journal.  Well, hmm...Lessee...not much new.  Still poor and bitching about it (I have 50 bucks in my bank account right now and I got my first loan statement this week--joy.)  The pups are back from Grandma's house: Frank is fatter than ever (it is possible) and Zoe is chewing more hair off her body every day.  Sigh.  I actually forgot they were here and left them alone for nearly 10 hours on Thursday.  (Doh!)  But they were good puppies and we had California Chicken Grill to celebrate.  Hmm...yeah, there's absolutely nothing exciting going on in my life.  Still trying to get the hell out of Florida, still poor, still bitter and angsty.  I cleaned out my closets and garbage-bagged a bunch of clothes I never wear to sell or take to Goodwill.  I guess that was kind of exciting.  Anyhoo, hope all is well with everyone out there in Cyberland. (Rent reference number 480 on my website.) Oh, I did get a new cell phone which means I need you all to re-email/AIM me your phone numbers because I no longer have any of them.  Eventually there will be new pictures on my website and I should be getting my guitar this week, so there could be exciting news forthcoming.  Until then "keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars."  (If you know whom I am quoting, I am EXTREMELY impressed.  Ciao bellos y bellas.

      So Rob K. has convinced me that I should stop ghetto-rigging my webjournal and use blogger instead.  If this test run works out, well...we'll see where we go from there.  For now: This is only a test.  I repeat this is only a test.  Were this a real webjournal entry it would be filled with witticisms, bitching and the usual abundance on nonsensical self-pity.  Please stay tuned.  DCCM

      An impromptu barbecue was held this evening almost leading to the scortching of Shawn's face...that was more from him using a torch to light a cigar than from the lighting of the big ass grill that is still steaming in my garden.  Speaking of Gardens I should get some plants that aren't dead.  That would be nice.  I almost bought some today but then I realized that groceries would probably be a better investment.  So answer me this all you men in my life.  Funny this blog is read almost entirely by men and yet none of you are dating me...huff... Anyway so the question I'm posing to all you testosterone reaking friends of mine is this: When did I go from do-able but not date-able to marriage-material but not date-able?  And how does one get oneself out of this situation?  And how do I become date-able?  Sheesh.    Now normally the questions I blog are mildly rhetorical (although I can't believe NONE of you jumped on that Drain the Lizard comment yesterday...talk about disappointing) but this one I'm actually looking for answers on this one...preferably funny ones...or hope-instilling ones...You can also feel free to embellish on your compliments.  It would just disappoint me so much to leave Gainesville without ever having a meaningful relationship that lasted more than a couple weeks.

      I know you're all in shock...I haven't blogged in 3 whole days!  It's not that I've been terribly busy.  I've been the opposite of very busy with the exception of work which has just been hellish this week.  I'm growing increasingly disgusting with my mundane Gainesville existence, and yet I'm at the point where I can't even afford to escape it.  The option of moving home is looking less and less tempting, I think that would only make me more insane.  I know that God has a plan, and that I should just sit here and let that happen, but...  Going to DC last week was perhaps the worst decision I've made in a while. Now that I know what's out there, it's hard to be even remotely happy here.  Still waiting on decent sleep and play...blech.  I'm so whiny lately...it's very very difficult for ME to feel more whiny than usual, eh?  Here's something to ponder whilst I wallow in self-pity: Why does the inside of the SoBe drink cap say "Drain the Lizard?  "

Dear God, is it not yet blatantly obvious how lacking in a life I am??  I also forgot to eat dinner...again. I really need to start getting some decent sleep and maybe some play...that would be nice.  Clearly neither one is happening tonight...  Grrr

      Having difficulty sleeping...and finding my own words to use tonight.  On an upnote, I discovered after temporarily crawling out from under my rock that DMB will be playing in West Palm this summer...  Say Goodbye  So here we are tonight, you and me together The storm outside, the fire is bright And in your eyes I see what's on my mind You've got me wild turned around inside And then desire, see, is creeping up heavy inside here And know you feel the same way I do now Now let's make this an evening Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight Stay here with me, love, tonight just for an evening When we make our passion pictures You and me twist up secret creatures And we'll stay here Tomorrow go back to being friends  Go back to being friends But tonight let's be lovers, We kiss and sweat We'll turn this better thing to the best Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss Tangled tongues and lips, See me this way I'm turning and turning for you Girl, just tonight   Float away here with me An evening just wait and see But tomorrow go back to your man I'm back to my world And we're back to being friends Wait and see me, Tonight let's do this thing All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours On our way here Tomorrow go back to being friends  Go back to being friends Tonight let's be lovers, say you will And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love A thing or two I have to say here Tonight let's go all the way then Love I'll see you, Just for this evening Let's strip down, trip out at this One evening starts with a kiss Run away   And tomorrow back to being friends Lovers...love...lovers Just for tonight, one night...love you And tomorrow say goodbye   ...and the hamster runs wildly on his wheel...

      I finally got my virus software updated only to discover I had over 900 virus files on my computer...fun stuff.  Hopefully now I will be able to update my website and add all my neato dc pictures...hahah.  Bets as to whether or not that will actually happen?  If tonight goes the way the rest of the weekend has gone, I'll probably just end up passed out on the couch, an unopened energy drink vulcan death gripped in my hands...Sigh.

      OKay, so the pictures are still not up from the dc trip...I know, I'm a slacker.  Actually I'm just experiencing my first real hangover.  Maybe my second.  I don't remember.   Just a night involving a lot of tequilla and fireflies...The pictures will be up soon.  I have to do one of the following first:  1: break down, learn html and get a real website of my own.  2: fight with geocities for more webspace  3. reorganize my entrire site.   But before I can do any of that I have to rejoin the world of people who type whilst sitting up.   PS: Hey Kimmie--quit stealing shit from my site.  My picture pages have been Picture Pages for a year and a half....grrr....

      They've changed the numbers on all the Exits on I-75 and now I'm no longer at exit 74, but rather at 368 (I think).  This is the most exciting thing I have to report now that I'm back in Florida.  Sigh.  What a depressing state to return to.  Ironically it's cooler here than it was in dc, but my office is paint-fumerrific and I'm once again parked in front of the television because there's simply nothing left to do. I'd rather be sitting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, watching the tourists and writing poetry that no one will ever read.  Hmm...perhaps going to dc wasn't such a good idea afterall.  Now I know what else is out there, what could have been had I gone to GW, and what might someday be if I don't give up hope and eventually find a job there.  Sigh.  Only 3 months until I leave Gainesville...I guess that's something to look forward, too, right?  The  urlLink DC pictures   should be up before morning if all goes as planned...or at least Part 1.  I have to wait until my credit cards are no longer maxed out before I can develop the other 2 rolls.  More when I'm done playing picture editor.  Tschus!

      I need to stop letting the men (boys) in my life have such great influence over my mood.  I mean, here I am, last night in d.c. and totally miserable?  Why? because one of the men in my life that I was so looking forward to seeing won't be stopping by.  It's not entirely his fault, he's been sick and whathaveyou, but that doesn't make me feel any better about being all dressed up (I even took the time to actually do my hair) and having no one to hang out with.  I gotta stop letting them get to me, and this one in particular.  I'm not heartbroken, mind you, that hasn't happened in years.  But I am tired of always feeling like I've been let down...again.  The fact that I'm leaving tomorrow doesn't make me feel any better either.  The last thing I want right now is to go home feeling like this.

      Sheer exhaustion has set in.  We walked all over Washington tonight and took lots of pictures of monuments in the dark.  Dubbya flew over our heads in his helicopter and I got giddy and sached down the sidewalk like the crazy Republican that I am.  We went to the Lincoln Memorial on, oddly enough, the 137th Anniversary of Lincoln's death and the park ranger was giving a lecture on Lincoln a la Dr. Spitznagel.  Then it was fun with the Metro again.  I swear one of us is going to get arrested before this trip is over.  The presentation went really well, and we seemed to get a good response from our audience.  I'm just glad it's over.  Now I can hang out with my boys and mope about the fact that I have less than 48 hours left in this beautiful city.  I really want to move here as soon as possible.  If any of you DC folks has a couch on which I can crash for a few weeks until I find a job, it would be greatly appreciated.  I seriously don't think I'll make it through the summer without going completely nuts here.  Sigh.  Anyway, tomorrow is more fun with the conference and kiddies...then tomorrow night I get the room to myself.  Yay!  :)

      I'm in D.C. and it's WONDERFUL!  Last night was a night of sheer sillyness and debauchery with Ryan and Matt, including a wonderful Italian dinner where the couple at the table next to us got engaged.  Then it was back to the hotel for fun with smokes and liquor.  Today we went to the National Gallery of Art and had fun on the Metro and went shopping.  Ann Taylors and Starbucks all over the place.  I picked up an apartment guide and I will be moving here ASAP.  Joy.  More later on in the week.  Time for cards with the kiddies.

      Questions being pondered whilst waiting for the laundry to dry so that I can pack and prepare for an inevitably exhausting day: 1. Why hasn't someone clued the McDonald's advertising folks into the fact that the Spice Girls broke up a long, long time ago? 2. Why did I drink that beer after dinner? 3. How did I end up with bras all over my living room floor? 4. How early is too early to start packing up my apartment? 5. When is Dave gonna come get the damn cow dishes already? 6. Am I really leaving Florida for a whole week tomorrow?  I am procrastinating on procrastinating at this point...

      Holy unproductive day, Batman!   I swear, no one wants to IM me tonight, but I couldn't keep you all away while I was at work today.  On an upnote, my computer is back up and running semi-properly.  Word is still acting freakish and virusy, but it should make it through the weekend, which is all I'm looking for at this point.  However between then and now I have a shitload of things to get done, so there won't be much blogigng for the next few days...wish me luck!

      It disgusts me to say so, but I've become intrigued and way too entertained by this show The Bachelor on ABC.  Sad because it's a beauty pagaent gone terribly awry, and yet, so much like a train wreck--you can't help but watch (I knew giving up tv for lent was a good thing.)  It's like a higher class version of Elimidate (like that's difficult) meets that terrible, terrible disaster known as Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire.  Ugh.  I can't wait to go to D.C. where there's actually real people with whom I have intelligent conversations whilst surrounded by buildings of history and culture.  Sigh...3 days and counting.  The work week brings with it such stress and self-pity lately.    Somehow it finally hit Jason that I have been stressed out beyond belief over the conference this weekend.  I was kind of like, "duh"...just because I was too busy trying to make all our tourism arrangements by myself while he did God knows what in his office.  He seems genuinely concerned this week, but it's just too late at this point.  I've made the decision to leave, and I have to stick with it.  If I don't do it now, I never will, right?  Some words of encouragement would be nice though (hint, hint).

      Wow this weekend was such a nice break from the low-cal, adventure free, mundane Gainesville existence I've been leading as of late.  Christy definitely needs to come up to visit more often.  Saturday was a day for massive reorganization and cleanliness.  I bought new automatically dispensing dishes for the dogs when I was at Sam's club supposedly grocery shopping.  Then it was chinese food in a box in a boat (don't ask) for dinner and then a night of sheer debauchery at Alligator Rocks.  The green eyes and long hair must really be doing something because I kept getting smiles all night.  Lindsay's cousin, Greg, (blonde hair, blue eyes, probably known by-name by the receptionist at the gym) was especially attentive.  I vaguely recall an offer for a kiss at one point during the evening.  Ah, beer, the social lubricant.  Then it was off to Denny's to "sober up" with greasy cheese fries and then to bed to dream sweet dreams of the fun I'll be having next week when I'm NOT in Florida, much less Gainesville.  Today I got to hear Ryan on the radio (yay!) and my parents came up to trade computers and pick up the dogs.  Definitely need more weekends like this one in the future.  It's so nice not to have to do the chasing for once.  Sigh.  If only I didn't have to go to work in the morning. :(

      I think I'm going to stop telling potential employers to call my cell phone--once I give them that number it seems they never call me back.    The call from Connecticut never came, and I went to Chilis to hang out with Christy et al. for the first time in what seems like FOREVER.  All of what remains of our little happy hour group is graduating in May which means there will be less happy hour times to be had in the future which makes me...more un-happy than usual.  Tonight one person in particular was being a little more flirty than usual until Jason called him on it which seemed to cause him to cuddle up to JAson instead.  :(  I must clarify that this is not the Jason who left work before 3 o'clock today, but rather the Jason that is Christy's wonderful and annoyingly perfect boyfriend.  Tomorrow it's off to Alligator Rocks for a much-needed night of debauchery.  All I can say--it's about damn time!  I intend to get well lubricated--liquored up you sickos--so that I can spend the rest of the week stressed out beyond belief.  Despite the upcoming stress, however, I'm really looking forward to dinner with some of my favorite men in the whole world next Friday night.  0= )

      So it's Thursday which automatically means chaos and misery.  Today was worse than usual, to the point where I couldn't help but complain about he-that-should-not-be-named all night at court.  When it got to be 24 hours since I last ate (since I was too busy working rather than talking to my girlfriend on the internet when I should have been getting ready for court) and I was waiting around babysitting while he was off getting "interviewed" by some journalism student from UF, I had had enough.  I'm so close to saying screw it, I quit...of course that would require having the money to pay my bills for the next couple months, when I can't even afford to do so this month.  I'm so frustrated I just want to scream.  What an absolute mess my life has become.  In the meantime I'll be content to watch Will and Grace and eat cookie dough.  "I came from a broken home and now I come from a broken gnome."  "I'm the gnome wrecker."

      Still completely exhausted and I don't know why.  Tried to call my doctor today for an appointment (use the benefits while they last) and apparently there's a 6 month waiting list.  Thank God I'm not dying.  God bless managed care.  Anxiously anxiously looking to leave this god forsaken state. Please, Please PLEASE keep your eyes open for jobs for me.  I'm getting closer and closer to completely losing my mind.  That aside, here is the rough itinerary for my trip to Washington for those of you who have been asking:  you can see the conference schedule at www.youthcourt.net            Friday April 12th--we should be arriving at approx 2pm into Regan Airport.  I'm anticipating we'll check into the Crystal Gateway Marriott by around 4 or so.  (We being my intern and I.)  The rest of the day and night our OURS.  We intend on doing some good partying, so those of you that are around, please join us.  I love showing off the fabulous, beautiful, intellegent men in my life.  No, Matt, I'm not talking about you.  :)  Okay, I am talking about you, but you don't need the ego boost.            Saturday--Jack around in the hotel, plan for sightseeing, hang out around the colleges and try to look for apartments on a limited basis.  At some point late afternoon Jason and the kids should start arriving.          Sunday--begin an exhausting week of networking.  Check in to the conference in the morning, attend an intensive seminar, babysit for a bit, network some more, fun with lobbying at the expo, spend the evening freaking out about my presentation on Monday morning--this is not a good day to plan on hanging out with me, but feel free to stop by the hotel.  I'll be the girl pulling out her hair surrounded by middle schoolers and one frazzled intern.        Monday--my lecture is at 11:15 am.  I would love for you all to be there, but I understand you all have to do that whole college thing.  I don't think the conference sessions run past dinner time, so my evening is free.        Tuesday--same as Monday.  This is the last day of the conference, so some partying may be in order---hopefully I'll have some good job opportunities up my sleeve.        Wednesday--sightseeing with the kiddies and hopefully a job interview or two in the city if I can get away.  I will have to be dragged kicking and screaming back to the airport at some point during the airport.  Back to Florida at around 9pm.  So anyway, that's the plan as of now.  Of course, this is me we're talking about so it's probably going to be completely different by  this time tomorrow.  After talking to Andrew P. tonight, I am convinced that I am indeed getting old.  Jeez, we know so many people gettting married, having babies, it's so scary.  Meanwhile, I'm still struggling to do what I should have done a long time ago--get the hell out of this god forsaken state.  I just have to keep July 31st in my head.  It's the only thing keeping me going this week.

      I guess when I was bitching about the lack of excitement in my life I should have been more specific as to the type of excitement that I wanted...  The extra short version, since it is now 3 am and I'm just now crawling into bed despite feeling mildly nauseous all day and being incapable of proper spelling and grammar as a result, is that my grandfather was missing for 8 hours today but is now safe at home and in bed and wondering why the dogs and I didn't come with my parents to his house at 2 this morning once he got back from driving around "sanford" for 6+ hours.  I say "sanford" because that's where he says he was, but we're not exactly sure if anything he says he's even remotely accurate about after the evening my father and I spent in the car driving around apopka with a SCSO deputy trying to locate him.  So since I've determined that every insane, random, bizarre obstacle I encounter as a result of my family must have buried in it some treasure of a lesson which I'm supposed to learn over the course of solving the puzzle, I'm chalking this one up to yet another reason why I never want to have children.  Tonight was not the type of excitement I was looking for, nor has the demon behind this door been completely conquored.  My mother, and as a result my father and I, have a long road ahead of us with dealing with whatever it is my grandfather is exhibiting signs of, and it is not going to be a pleasant battle.    Of course, the eternal optimist in me (you know, the part I get from my father?) looks at it this way: I still have my flaming red hair and Harry Potter comes out on dvd in 2 days...yeah, I know. sleep and good drugs...

      Well, it seems like everyone else's life is much more exciting than mine lately.  Ryan is off galavanting in Pennsylvania with the Trinity folks,  urlLink Rebecca  is off in south Florida doing God knows what...it's hard to keep track of that girl these days...her blogs are random and mildly incoherent (hi kettle, I'm pot...pot...hehehe)  :)  David is allegedly coming to Orlando, although I wouldn't know because he and I are not on speaking terms today, Dave is in the process of moving back to DC,  urlLink Kimmie  is moving to New York next week, Rob and El are in Atlanta, hell, even Katie and Shawn managed to plan something mildly exciting for the weekend, and me?  I'm stuck in Borelando with my charming cousin for four fun-filled days.  At least Avi is probably going to be in town this weekend, too.  We can be miserable and bitter together.    The good news is that I'm no longer feverish or fluish and I'm sitting up and capable of typing for the first time in a few days.   I'm also up for any suggestions to make this weekend more bearable.

      Warning: To the person who gave me this wretched cold.  Take it back.  Take it away cuz I don't want it anymore...oh, and while you're at it, do you want to go to Orlando this weekend and spend it with my family doing absolutely nothing for the third weekend in a row?    At least last weekend I got to see Thomas who my father had affectionately dubbed "Top of the Shitlist."  His reign however has been short lived seeing as he has once again been replaced by David.  Well, more the 16 year old bitch David used to call his girlfriend than David himself...but he's not on my good list either right now.

      So in case any of you are wondering why I haven't been online since I left Gainesville, it appears as though our computer phone line is possessed.  When you call it, it rings busy, even when it's not, and when you attempt to dial up on computer or use a phone, it makes terrible noises...much like the groans of the spiderman audience upon seeing Ryan's and my rendition of attaching a spider web to the building as we exited the theatre. (It sounds weird now, but it was really, really fuckin funny at the time.)  I was also informed by a strange man in the theatre lobby that there was never a Spidergirl but there should have been and I could be her.  Hmm...SO bottom line, my phone line is possessed, so I have to either hang out in the living room or type in the dark in my parents' bedroom...neither of which is a pleasant experience.  But hey, at least tomorrow we're going to Melting Pot.  Yummy.

      If I could go to conferences every day rather than actually doing my job I would almost being willing to stay poor for another few months.  Friday I'm interviewing for the other job, so please wish me luck!  It would mean almost 200 more per week, which would almost mean I could afford to live without a roommate until I can save up for my PhD.  In the meantime I get to deal with grief counseling with my volunteers tomorrow as well as orienting 2 of my new interns to the hell that is Thursday at Teen Court.  Never a dull moment, eh?  Oh wait...then there's my personal life...

      Craziness at work, craziness at home, and sheer exhaustion in between.  The good news is that I'm going to Orlando for the weeken...wait...that's not good news...hmm...  Wait!  There is good news.  I'm going to see Thomasito in a few weeks when we go to North Carolina for Memorial Day weekend.  Until then I have new interns to train, a shitload of work to do, jobs to interview for, and on top of all that Shawn has made me his Uniform Sewing Bitch...The things I do for you men in my life.  Sheesh.  And I'm not even getting any out of the deal.  NOTE: That was in NO WAY a hint or suggestion that Shawn and I have having an affair, contrary to popular belief around the Office.  Katie would kick my ASS.  :)

Oh but go right ahead and grab my ass on your way to pass out....           David "If it weren't my weekend on..." Hill...for a variety of reasons at this point least of which is handcuffing me to the point where I have BRUISES!  (And not in the good way.)           My dogs...for being the reason that I am home rather than still out partying at 2:30 am           All the lightweights who were either (a) passed out or (b) throwing up by the time I got to the party at...oh 12:10...thanks once again to #2 on the shitlist...David.             Grumble grumble grumble.    But hey, at least I made a damn good dinner tonight.

I would have been a lot more sad were I able to feel anything except really really hyper.  I'm having Shawn and David and Rebecca over for Manacotti tonight so it's back into the kitchen for me.  Then it's off to Jason's for a kick ass party and lots and lots of debauchery.  Graduation is so much more to celebrate when you don't have to sit through the ceremony!

If you're really bored (and you must be if you're reading this drivel) check out the quiz in my AIM Profile...if you're really REALLY bored, I have a different quiz for when I'm at work.  Okay, I'm really, really bored.  On an up note, I'm going to a kick ass party tomorrow night.  Time for a nap.  Then it's martha stewart cleaning and redecorating time.  Sheesh.

      If someone is looking to get me a half-birthday present next month, please invest in purchasing some spare time for me.  The fact that Bruce has gotten me into a habit of napping even more often than I have in the past (yes, it is possible) isn't a good thing...well, it's kind of a good thing.  :)  Tomorrow it's fun with kiddies and amusement parks.  We're taking our volunteers on a trip to Wild Adventures in Valdosta, GA.  Gotta love getting paid to ride rollercoasters.  The best part is that I get to drive an unmarked Sheriff's Office vehicle, complete with lights and sirens and a radio.  Heheheh...mui malo.  ()=)  Zoe has embarked on a mission to destroy my house.  In the past 2 weeks I've lost: my angel wings, a pair of heels, two rolls of paper towels, the cover of my day planner, a couple bags of garbage, a loaf of bread, and she almost got her grubby paws on Butros Butros Galli while I was showering this morning.  The dog is on a rampage.  My parents and Bruce have come to the conclusion that she's not getting enough attention.  Shit, I thought I was the attention whore around here.  Sheesh.  So next weekend, I'm shipping her off to Grampa Boot Camp so Dad can re-teach her to bite feet and mom can feed her toast and she can hate me even more than she already does.  Well, I basically did nothing but nap all afternoon, and I'm still exhausted and since I have to be up at the crack of dawn, I'm off to bed.

      Tuesday's Funny Story of the Day (note: I realize that today is Wednesday, but I haven't had a chance to blog until now.)  So I'm walking down the hallway going to check my mail when I see a guy ahead who looks vaguely familiar.  Come to realize it's Jason Quint!  Jason and I were in Math Super Stars together in middle school and hung out a bit in high school, too.  Apparently he's been working over in Communications for almost a year, now, and we have never crossed paths.  Holy Gainesville weirdness, batman!  Well, if you're bored (and you must be if you're reading this drivel) please make sure to    urlLink Take my FriendTest      It will make me oh so happy.    Tonight is Dawson's Creek and pedicure night.  Woohoo!  Being a girlfriend is so much fun.  ()=)

      Busy busy weekend...  Friday night we went to Borders and watched a lot of crappy dating reality tv shows.  Then on Saturday it was time for Amy's indoor luau and a rain-filled drive to St. Pete for Christy and Jason's housewarming party.  It was wonderful, save the 6 or so hours attempting to sleep on their schnazzy, non-pullout couch.  By Sunday afternoon we both officially needed a break (and a nap).  Bruce got two thumbs up from both Christy and Jason, so now the only test left for him to pass is Thomas, which isn't likely to happen for a while since that biotch is moving to a big city so he can get some action from hoochies with teeth...Hoochies with Teeth...sounds like redneck porn or a really really poorly named country rock band.  Thomas' opinion aside, I'm keeping this one around for a while.  Afterall, how often do I meet a guy that even Frankie can't resist?  :)

I'm getting ready to head home (yes, I'm blogging on the clock yet again) for a fun-filled weekend.  I'll be out and about most of the time, but you can always reach me on my cell.

      Okay, okay, so I'm a blogging slacker.  The only excuse I have is that I haven't been online at home all week.  So now I'm blogging from the office.  Ahhh procrastination at its finest.  Actually, it's been kind of a hectic week.  My dad is in the hospital for stomach problems.  Mom and I have decided that he didn't get enough tools for Father's Day, so he's craving some extra attention.  We're still waiting to find out whether or not he has to have surgery.  The waiting game is the most frustrating part of life.  I would rather just know.  Sigh.  Thankfully I have a wonderful boyfriend who is being super supportive and attentive.  It's nice to have someone to keep me in line.  :)  I finally went to Rotator for the first time last night.  It was an interesting combination of people.  Amy, Jason, Providence and her boyfriend (whose name I still haven't learned) and of course Bruce were there from work, and then there were a ton of Rehab folk--Christie, Brooke, Dan, Jeremy and a bunch of their friends I don't know.  The biggest lesson gleaned from last night's experience may be that I'm getting too old for sweaty, loud, crowded Gainesville nightclubs.  Also, I've apparently become a drink nurser, according to Christie.  Both Christie and Brooke were highly disappointed in my lack of binging.  Christie rocks and is my favorite person right now (other than Bruce, of course) because she will be babysitting for us this weekend when we go to St. Pete for the other Christy and Jason's housewarming party.  I don't know when I'm going to get the chance to sleep at this point.  Sheesh.  Speaking of Rehab folk, I talked to Thomas last night for the first time in FOREVER.  He was out of town for a cruise and now he's moving.  Apparently he shaved his cat to look like a lion and has gotten into the habit of growling at it so that it meows loudly.  Poor cat.  Thomas needs to get some so bad it's not even funny.  He's moving to Charlotte soon, where the hoochies are more often single, without children and generally have more teeth.  Of course this means it will be even LONGER until I get to see him.  Hufff.  This weekend is going to be tons of fun.  More news to come!  d

      Okay, so I'm a TOTAL idiot.  The movie was Best in Show, not dog show (Thanks kimmie.)  I was just a little preoccupied at the time of last writing, and clearly the priority in that entry lay a little lower.  We had lunch today and just finished talking on the phone for almost 2 hours.  I think even Kimmie would approve of this one...and Rebecca.  (Tomorrow he's bringing me a CD of traditional Jewish music.)  I definitely have a lot to contemplate now, and a lot to process as I make the laborious drive home yet again this weekend.  Stay tuned for what will hopefully be some intriguing and exciting journal entries in the future.  D

      This weekend was quite a bit more exciting than last weekend.  Friday night I officially washed my hands of David when he bailed on a damn good Chicken Piccata dinner I spent a decent amount of time preparing.  He didn't even have the decency to call.  Schmuck.  Shawn almost got himself on the Shitlist by pouring ranch dressing all over the chicken and telling me half way through the meal that he didn't like garlic...good timing there, Shawn.  As usual, Katie remained my favorite Gainesville person...or at least one of them, but I'll get there in a minute...  Saturday Ryan came up and we did attorney training for 4 hours.  Lots of new attorneys, I'm excited, and Ryan did a great job covering Argumentation and Ethics with me.  We wandered unsuccessfully around the mall and then went to Tequillas for dinner.  Then it was off to Do Art to paint pottery for a few hours.  I'm going to become addicted to this place before I leave Gainesville, I can just see it.  We rented Dog Show, funny and very similar to Drop Dead Gorgeous.  I give it ****  Sunday Bruce and I went to Leonardo's 706 for lunch and then to see Insomnia.  After that we came back here and Frank and Zoe worked their magic on him.  The date gets *****   ()=)

      Got up, watched some tv, went grocery shopping, bought and planted some plants and got really dirty in the process, showered cooked dinner, finished watching harry potter, talked to thomasito, applied for jobs, chatted online a bit, and now I'm blogging.  Sigh.  It seems like a lot was done, but a good majority of it was (1) out of sheer boredom and (2) procrastinating in cleaning/packing my office.    I'm at that point where I don't know what I should leave out or if I'm packing too soon.  A part of me cannot wait to get the hell out of this godforsaken town.  The other part wishes I knew where the hell I was going instead.  "How did I get here, how the hell? Pann left, close on the steeple of the church.  How did I get here?..."  Sorry, a little Rent interlude seemed appropriate for some reason.  On an upnote, my fingernails are red and glittery to match my hair and now my eyebrows match as well. Yay. Apparently with the green contacts and red hair all my kids think I look like Kirsten Dunst..they just wanted me to give them good cases....  Well, tomorrow I swear I will be getting some cleaning and packing done around here...or else I'll have some more not-so-exciting stuff I got done instead to report.  :)

      Happy Birthday  urlLink Bruce!!   Tomorrow afternoon I leave on my  urlLink roadtrip adventure  and my first real vacation in a very long time.  I'm kind of excited, and I think I'll be more excited once I stop stressing out about everything I still have to do between now and then.  I'm especially excited that over the next 2 weeks I'll get to see Ryan, Avi, Jodi, Matt,  urlLink Elyse , Andrew, urlLink  Kimmie ,  urlLink Thomas , and tons of relatives and friends I haven't seen in  years .  I'm not sure how much I'll get to post while I'm away but there will definitely be pictures galore once I get back!

      I've been extra busy doing a whole lot of nothing this week...  Jason's out of town which means I'm doing his job as well as mine, I'm in intake hell and have interviewed a potential total of 5 interns for fall semester.  Ack.  Thankfully, 2 of them are oldies, so they won't need to be trained and Christie doesn't need onsite supervision, so hopefully it won't be that bad.  I wish I could keep the 4 I have right now around forever, because they are WONDERFUL.  But alas, they're off to get jobs where they actually get paid.  :(  I've decided that if and when my raise actually goes through I'm going to overhaul my site on my own domain and actually break down and learn html.  We'll see if that ever happens.  I was also supposed to write a new play this summer, but I haven't even put pen to paper yet.  I'll add that to the list of things I intend to do on the roadtrip that won't actually get done because I'll be passed out in the back of Babe trying not to throw up.     My goal for today is to decide what  urlLink broadway show  I want to see whilst in New York.  Any suggestions?

       The Longest Time   ~Billy Joel~ Oh, oh, oh For the longest time Oh, oh, oh For the longest time If you said goodbye to me tonight There would still be music left to write What else could I do I'm so inspired by you That hasn't happened for the longest time Once I thought my innocence was gone Now I know that happiness goes on That's where you found me When you put your arms around me I haven't been there for the longest time Oh, oh, oh For the longest time Oh, oh, oh For the longest I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall And the greatest miracle of all Is how I need you And how you needed me too That hasn't happened for the longest time Maybe this won't last very long But you feel so right And I could be wrong Maybe I've been hoping too hard But I've gone this far And it's more than I hoped for Who knows how much further we'll go on Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone I'll take my chances I forgot how nice romance is I haven't been there for the longest time I had second thoughts at the start I said to myself Hold on to your heart Now I know the woman that you are You're wonderful so far And it's more than I hoped for I don't care what consequence it brings I have been a fool for lesser things I want you so bad I think you ought to know that I intend to hold you for the longest time

      Thanks to everyone who came out for the 4th of July BBQ yesterday--and a special thanks to Bruce for helping me to clean up!  I'm always glad for an opportunity to corrupt the minds of the young by introducing them to the fine art of Mafia.  And now I'll have enough hot dogs, corn, and pasta salad a la Kimmie to eat for a month.    Today Bruce has been kind enough to offer to take me apartment hunting.  I wish I could stay where I am, this apartment rocks, but I can't afford it now that I've got a buttload of loans to start paying back.  I'm especially jealous of Bruce because he's got a huge house with a big fenced in yard that would be awesome for the doggies.  At this point there just going to have to be happy not to be dressed up in Old Navy flag t-shirts and sunglasses anymore.  The good news is that Bruce is making me dinner tonight (I could definitely get used to this) and then it's off to Orlando tomorrow morning for Daddy's birthday.

      Back from the Workers' Comp conference since Wednesday, but I've been busy trying to get my brain to function and getting the last few boxes unpacked since then.  I'm still not done...sigh.  Renee came down Friday night and we hung out with some people from work.  During a game of Mafia, Bruce and I proved once again that we are too smart for ACSO.  But alas, we're stuck here for the time being.  I was supposed to be seeing Thomas this weekend, or so I thought, but the lines of communication broke down somewhere along the way, and he ended up only being in Florida for 24 hours, during which he was celebrating his Mom's birthday.  He may be moving back to Florida sometime soon, which is exciting stuff.  I've missed having my best buddy in the same city, and 3 states away has been rough.  Tomorrow the new interns start, so it's gonna be a long week. Hopefully working out will happen sometime this week as well.  Sigh.

      The new apartment is finally almost completely put together...just in time for me to go to Orlando for the Workers' Comp Conference.  To answer the inevitable, no Workers Comp has absolutely nothing to do with my job at the Sheriff's Office and no I haven't gotten a different job.  I get CEUs and lots of free office supplies and I get to dress up all fancy on Sunday night.  That and I get out of the office for 3 days--woohoo!!  Then next week Thomasito will be in town--yay!    I still haven't bothered to put the new pictures up on my site yet.  It is, however, under construction and will soon have it's own domain!  More news when there's actually something to report.  ~D~

      Wow, it's been almost a month since I posted....well, hmm...there's tons to catch everyone up on...  The trip was good...a little too long to be away from my sweetie, but good nonetheless.   I'm only disappointed that I didn't get to see a lot of the people I had intended to see in New York.  The wedding was just insanity, it ended up taking almost 1/3 of the time I was in NYC and the rest of the days were spent running around like crazy or waiting for the old people to catch up with  me.  I finally got to see the Holocaust Memorial/Museum, took a tour of NYC at night, ate dinner in Little Italy, saw a ton of relatives and now I'm still trying to catch up on my sleep.  I've decided I'm never going to miss ten days of work in a row again, however.  There was way too much to catch up on when I got back.    Once I got back, it was time to move, to prepare for my wonderful interns to leave me (I'm SO sad about it.) and there was all kinds of family insanity to deal with as well.  It's been a stressful homecoming, but things are finally calming down now.  I'm just excited because Katie and I have plans to decorate my new apartment this weekend and I got my new leather couch and recliner to chill on.  Bruce and I have decided that they make excellent Nintendo-playing furniture.    That's all to report for now.  I'm still deliberating whether or not to post my pictures from my trip to my site since Bruce has offerred to "fix" it once I get my own domain.  That should happen in the next couple months.  Looks like I'll be learning html after all!

      Okay, so after being harrassed by 4 of you for not blogging and not being online, I'm finally breaking down and typing up a quick entry.  Only because I can't sleep...because sleeping requires the ability to breathe through one's nose.  It's been kind of a whirlwind month, but I'll try to sum it up as briefly as possible.  Went flat broke twice, spoke at a conference, trained some new interns, trained a shitload of volunteers, caught hell from my mom a lot, celebrated an assload of birthdays, got interviewed by a local tv station only to experience first hand the age-old communications theory of Agenda Setting in action, started a fundraising campaign for a foster care center, helped to marchman act a client, interviewed in office volunteers, campaigned for a pay increase and won, campaigned against a competitor program and kind of lost, worked on a book, mastered The Sims, spent lots of time with Bruce, and spent a whole lot of time neglecting my online friends.  I'm sorry ya'll.  I'm still learning that wonderful art of balancing having a wonderful loving boyfriend with having so many wonderful friends.  I hope you all don't feel that I don't love or miss you.  I'm just inanely busy with everything going on at work lately.  But I promise to try to get in touch with you all very soon.  Info about the Halloween party should be up for your viewing pleasure relatively soon.  For now just know that it's going to kick ass, and you should be there.    More timely blogs to come, I promise.  ~Dan~

      The Halloween Party invites are out.  (If you read this and you're in Florida and you didn't get one, it's probably because I didn't have your email in my address book for some reason, or I emailed your significant other instead.)  Let me know and I'll send it to you.  Unless of course you're on the shitlist.  :)  Work still sucks, I'm still sick and I'm tired and cranky, too.  But at least now I have a goth devil costume to compliment my attitude.    This is gonna be a short entry because I'm tired and I haven't AIMed with folks in a while, but I'm still making that effort to blog more often.  Hope you're all well.  Email soon.  :)  ~D~

      well, Blogger is being a pain in the ass and not letting me publish any of my blogs as of late...but I'm writing more often or at least making an effort too.  My next goal is to actually charge my temporary cell phone and perhaps actually speak with one or more of you for real rather than chatting online for all of 2 seconds whilst I'm at work.  Speaking of work, have I mentioned lately how overwhelmingly stressful my job has become?  Last year I thought fall semester was stressful because I was finishing my thesis and trying to graduate.  Now I know that it's just insane in general and from now on I'm going to save up my sick leave and vacation time during the rest of the year and take every other week off during the fall...of course, that would probably make the time when  I was at work even MORE stressful...which I think would lead me to actually committing homicide, which would make great headlines for the Gainesville Sun...ugh.  I need to sleep. For 3 months straight.    I feel really bad for Bruce, having to put up with my crazy ass lately.  I won't be suprised if he dumps me because I'm stressing him out so much.  I just keep telling him (and myself) that it's gotta get better.  Only because if it gets much worse one of us (or both) is going to have to be institutionalized.  On a completely random note I'm most likely going swing dancing tomorrow night, which will be both exciting and a semi-attempt at working out.  Hopefully decompressing and stress relief will be involved as well.

      As Ryan would say I'm in the "crockpot" known as Borelando for the weekend, and I've done nothing thus far except attempt to make arrangements to see you people who are here suffering through the jungle-like conditions along with me.  Just think, I have to put up with this crap ALL YEAR LONG!!  Blah blah blah, get out of Florida, blah blah.  Yeah, I know, I know.  It will happen...sooner or later.  I also took a much needed nap, so I'm up, awaiting the phone call to let me know Bruce has indeed made it safely to Coral Springs (Oral Springs?) so that I can rest peacefully and prepare for the hellashopping that will be done on Friday morning.  So the goals for this weekend include getting a bit of writing done, getting a bit of reading done...attempting to update (or get rid of) my geocities site and maybe see a few folks while I'm in town.  On the list are Andy B., Thomas, Ryan, Judd, Renee, and maybe some more of the Trinity folks that I've begun to forget anything other than their screennames considering Yoda has yet to arrange a reunion for us thus far this year.  Then there's the traditional Thanksgiving weekend crap: putting up the fake tree, putting up the lights, bitching at my mother, attempting to balance my father's giant Christmas Village on top of my poor baby grand piano, and keeping my parents from feeding the dogs too much Turkey.  Short story long, I'm gonna be bored this weekend, folks, so give a call to the cell or an email.  It could be worse, I could be in Miami...

      Well, it's downright nasty outside, so I suppose it's time for my bi-monthly journal ranting.  Not much ranting to do today, as Bruce and I went to see  urlLink Chamber of Secrets  last night.  Joygasm!! It was awesome!  I highly recommend it (surprise, suprise).  The Bassilsk is REALLY scary and the Wizard Duel with Malfoy is pretty damn cool.  Pay special attention to the very last scene (in the Great Hall), and particularly the noticibly younger Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson.  It rather obviously was shot first, at the end of shooting the last film.    The next film already has me aprehensive, with a new Dumbledore and a new director, who knows what changes will be made.  I'm just hoping that they put the Sorting Hat song in one of these days.  The film was actually pretty violent for PG, and I'm just thinking there's no way that Goblet of Fire will get a PG rating if they stay true to the book.  Who knows...I'm just hoping that Order of Pheonix will come out some time in the next Century.  ANYWAY, the Harry Potter rant is over...for now...  Christy and Jason are in town and I'm hoping to get to see them, if only for fifteen minutes at some point.  The problem is (long story, don't ask) the boyfriend has the car parked in front of his house right now and I'm sitting on my office floor.  The plan for today is to clean the house and do some laundry (going commando has ceased to be a cheap thrill) but I'll probably just end up plaing Yoshi all afternoon.  Toodles!

      Okay, so it's been nearly a month, but there are legitimate excuses this time.  The end of the semester was INSANE, to say the least.  I got back from my grandfather's funeral just in time for the end of the school semester, and one of my interns who was supposed to be continuing on in the spring for about 30 hours a week quit on me, so I had to "hire"/recruit/interview/arrange for background checks to replace her.  Now I'm going to have 5 new interns to train in January.  Joy.  Training aside, I'm excited about this new group of interns.  They all seem very enthusiastic about working at Teen Court and it will be nice to have a good energy around the office.  Then a week ago it was off to South Florida to "Meet the Parents" which was an adventure and a half.  FYI, don't ever EVER fly on a one way ticket unless you want to feel completely and totally violated.  Not only did they search me, they searched everything in my luggage and I mean EVERYTHING.  It was not a pleasant experience.    Got back the day before Chrismtas Eve, having done basically none of my Christmas shopping done, and ended up doing all of my mom's Christmas shopping, too.  4 hours at the mall on Christmas Eve was not my idea of a good time, I assure you.  Christmas was nice and quiet this year.  Bruce came up the day after Christmas for a couple hours and we exchanged gifts and had dinner with my parents.  He's my sweetie, and I love him lots.  We spoiled each other and now I have lots of toys that I will play with as soon as I get over this bastard of a sinus infection that I somehow contracted right before he arrived in Orlando.    The New Year's Eve party is still planned for this year and hopefully I'll be able to participate.  It would be nice to be able to hear and smell by then.  We'll see.  Until the next time I'm able to focus for more than 4 minutes...take care of yourselves.  Mwah!

      Finally back from Connecticut.  I'm still in Orlando, but returning to Gainesville in the morning for what will undoubtedly be a week of insanity at the office.  I'm just glad the week is over, funerals are expensive, stressful and anxiety producing.  Add that to almost a week out of the office, this coming week being the interns' last/first, having to fly, and not sleeping for 4 days and I'm ready for a vacation.  Poor Bruce got stuck babysitting all week after having to drive me to Orlando to meet my folks.  Oy.  I never thought I'd be glad to be back in Florida...sheesh.  By the way, for those of you who had been looking for the article about my grandfather, it's located at http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orl-loccfbriefs05120502dec05.story under Volusia County.  His name was Daniel Cardillo.

      Back in the crockpot unexpectedly.  My grandfather passed away today and we're getting ready to head up to Connecticut for the funeral...pending we don't get caught in the 2-7 inches of snow they're expecting overnight.  We're all handling things realatively well, considering the circumstances.  I won't put the details in here, suffice to say that it was not a pleasant way to go...  Other than that, the end of the semester is proving more hectic than usual.  Any thoughts and prayers offered would be much appreciated at this point.  ~Dan~

Maybe now I'll have to update it or something.  Thanks to Shawn for hosting a superbowl party with lots of good food...yummy.  Thanks for all the birthday wishes.  I swear I'll get around to answering my email at some point this week.    I finished all of my stuff for UCF on Friday, so now it's wait-and-see time.  Hopefully they'll not only accept me, but will give me advanced standing and lots of money to go with it...Woo!  We'll see.  Hope you're all well.  Write if you get a chance.  Mwah!

       urlLink Kim  is scary sometimes...  This has been a week of doctors and random bills...the real bad news is that I'm almost old enough to deserve the gray hairs I'm getting.  Despite Avi's (and more recently my boss') statements that I'm going to be 35 tomorrow, I'm actually only turning 24.  I just feel 35.  I'm having my midlife crisis a few years early...resisting the temptation to dye my hair pink and dress like a hotter, more classy version of Kelly Osborne.  I finished my UCF app last night and sent it off.  Now I just have to get one final reference and pray they give me lots and lots of money (and maybe let me teach a class or two.)  Sheesh I'm turning into my mother.  Somebody send me porn and a one way ticket to Europe, quick.

      Bruce and I went to see Chicago tonight.  I must agree with Kimmie: It was AWESOME!  I was really skeptical going into the film, thinking it was going to be a bastardization of musical theatre a la Moulin Rouge.  To my pleasant surprise, it was not only true to the Fosse original, but the cinematography and special effects not afford to an on stage performance enhanced rather than disturbing the suspension of disbelief.  I think most surprising of all, however, was that, occassionally, Renee Zelwiger can actually open her eyes like a normal person.  :)  Well, now back to the lack of reality that inundates the television these days...

      So I neglected to blog about it when it occured because everything was insane with the end of the semester, but the day after I got back from my grandfather's funeral in Connecticut, Kellie called me to tell me that my friend John, a former graduate assistant at the University of Alabama and more recently the head coach at Clemson and LSU, died in what at the time was suspected was a freak accident in his school's theatre.  Having just gotten back from burying a family member, I was kind of numb to the whole ordeal, with the exception of making the comment to Kellie that "these things always happen in three's..."  Rebecca informed me a few minutes ago that Ryan Rimmer, a UF Parlimentary Debater I had the pleasure of coaching at a few tournaments last year, was killed the other day in a car accident.  I never knew Ryan well enough to really consider him a friend, but what I do know is that he was always a very pleasant person to be around, he was always kind and had a great sense of humor.  Ryan loved his teammates and his coaches and he had a huge heart.  My thoughts and prayers with Kellie and Rob and the rest of the UF team and Ryan's friends and family members during this time of tragedy.  I know Ryan exemplified the spirit of UF Debate and that he saw the team more as an extension of his family.  God bless you all and God speed, Ryan.

      Happy New Year!!  This year my resolution was to not make any resolutions.  None that I call a resolution anyway.  They tend to last only a few months anyway.  I do however intend on keeping my house clean and sticking to a workout schedule from now on...  Thanks to everyone who came to the usual New Year's Eve gathering, it was a blast as usual.  To those of you who missed out, as Bruce would say, "BOOO!"  Thanks especially to my baby who braved a 2 hour drive in the monsoon that was last night's weather with a sore throat and sinus problem just so I would have someone to kiss at midnight.  I really don't deserve you.  All my love always, Dan.

      Blogger has been evil again lately and I was computerless all weekend (I left it at the office-the downside of a laptop...) so this is my first chance to blog in a while.  Not much going on lately...if you're sick of all this coverage of Michael Jackson raise your hand!  Can you say histrionic hypochondriac boys and girls?  So here's a list of things I plan to do when I go back to school:   1) pay less money for stuff...yet have less money at the same time. 2) update my webpage...you know things were far more interesting on here before I entered the real world. 3) take vacations...that I can't afford because I won't be working full time. 4) get back to my normal tolerance level...I'm on wine glass #2 and the keys feel funny... 5) do a better job of keeping in touch with people.  At least Ryan has the excuse of being in Belgium.  I've no excuse, I'm just lazy. 6)learn all kinds of really cool things. 7) see if I can make it through a class without buying (or checking out) the text book.  Bruce and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day.  We went to Leonardo's 706 for dinner and then went to Borders where we purchased Circus and Mexican Polka CDs for the value price of $1.  (And worth every penny...well, maybe not the polka cd...)  I bought the Narnia Chronicles.  I haven't read them since 5th grade and I think I have Goblet of Fire memorized at this point.  On Saturday we went to see Gangs of New York...I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.  I liked the U2 song (duh) but I agree with Bruce that it didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the soundtrack all that well.  Of course, it's Bono, so whatever.  Sunday I finally got my cell phone replaced...again.   Apparently there was a recall on the batteries, but they decided not to make any non-defective ones.  So instead I have a bright, shiny silver phone.  I've named her Sue.  However, the problem is I have once again lost all of your phone numbers.  This, of course means that you get to call me!  And then we can catch up on all the wonderful mundaneness that is life after college.  Bruce and I have been on a reality tv show kick for the past few months, but I must say the season finales have been downers so far (with the exception of the Mole because I was totally right!  Ha!)  Joe Millionaire was totally predictable, not the mention that he should be sterilized since he is literally too dumb to be permitted to breed.  High School Reunion just reaffirmed my decision to never attend any of mine and proved that some people really don't mature past the 12th grade.  On Wednesday is the Bachelorette finale, which is kind of pointless since it's been all over the news who she ends up with (I totally would have picked the other guy...)  The good news is that I attended a really terrible conference today.  It was really offensive, and would have made all the Rehab Professors hair curl.  "Labeling a child as an exceptional education student doesn't do any good.  We should just put them in classes with everyone else so that they can learn to exist in normal society."  Yeah, because that's not offensive.  And let's just put the low IQed kids in with everyone else, so they can feel  really  dumb.  Sigh.  Not once at this "Disability" Seminar was the word accommodation even mentioned.  After being nauseous all day AND listening to that drivel, I went to the office for an additional 3 hours of work.  I'm so bored I'm putting in extra hours...  Well, that's about all the consciousness I can stream for one night.  I have to be counseling in 8 hours and I haven't even gotten the school to give me permission yet.  Tomorrow's going to be one of those days.  Until next time...

      First thing's first...  DAAAAAAAAAVVVVVVVEEEEE!!!!!!  I finally got to chat with Dave Foster tonight for the first time in like SIX MONTHS!!  He seems to be doing well, still in the greater DC area.  I think he's just waiting for me to come up there and hang out.  :)  Work is going to be hellish this week.  Jason is on vacation in Switzerland (must be nice) and expects me to do his job (shut up Ryan) as well as mine while he is gone.  Considering my job is really the work of like 3 people, I hope he enjoys his vacation while it lasts becuase he's going to be playing catch up for many moons to come.    Gator is this weekend and I'm looking forward to it and dreading it at the same time.  It will be nice to give Bruce a glimpse into that scary wonderland that was my life in college, however, I'm not looking forward to seeing a few of the people that come along with the tournament.  It's going to be depressingly reminiscent of my freshman year, with recent events and whatnot.  But perhaps, as Susan suggested, it will bring the team together and maybe give Kellie a little relief from the bitching and moaning for once.  Well, I'm off to bed.  Us old people go to bed early or stay up all night eating cookies.  Considering the clean-the-car wager Bruce and I have going, I'm going to hit the sack while I have the possibility of not having gained weight today on my side.  That and Zoe is giving me the "Sleepytime" face.  Toodles!!

      Rather than send out spam that everyone hates, I figured I'd put this on here for those who would use it. Unlike the fucking protestors who disrupted our court proceedings twice now, or blocked rush-hour traffic in downtown manhattan last week, preventing EMS workers from doing their job and saving lives, I'm not going to push my opinions on those who don't wish to hear them. This was sent to me by my friend, Christy, whose brother is enlisted at the Naval Academy. He and all our troops, both at home and abroad are in my thoughts and prayers.  The average age of the military man is 19 years.  He is a short haired, tight-muscled kid who, under normal circumstances is considered by society as half man, half boy. Not yet dry behind the ears, not old enough to buy a beer, but old enough to die for his country.  He never really cared much for work and he would rather wax his own car than wash his father's; but he has never collected unemployment either.  He's a recent High School graduate; he was probably an average student, pursued some form of sport activities, drives a ten year old jalopy, and has a steady girlfriend that either broke up with him when he left, or swears to be waiting when he returns from half a world away.  He listens to rock and roll or hip-hop or rap or jazz or swing and 155mm Howitzers.  He is 10 or 15 pounds lighter now than when he was at home because he is working or fighting from before dawn to well after dusk.  He has trouble spelling, thus letter writing is a pain for him, but he can field strip a rifle in 30 seconds and reassemble it in less time in the dark.  He can recite to you the nomenclature of a machine gun or grenade launcher and use either one effectively if he must.  He digs foxholes and latrines and can apply first aid like a professional.  He can march until he is told to stop or stop until he is told to march.  He obeys orders instantly and without hesitation, but he is not without spirit or individual dignity.  He is self-sufficient. He has two sets of fatigues: he washes one and wears the other. He keeps his canteens full and his feet dry.  He sometimes forgets to brush his teeth, but never to clean his rifle.  He can cook his own meals, mend his own clothes, and fix his own hurts. If you're thirsty, he'll share his water with you; if you are hungry, his food.  He'll even split his ammunition with you in the midst of battle when you run low.  He has learned to use his hands like weapons and weapons like they were his hands. He can save your life - or take it, because that is his job.  He will often do twice the work of a civilian, draw half the pay and still find ironic humor in it all. He has seen more suffering and death then he should have in his short lifetime.  He has stood atop mountains of dead bodies, and helped to create them.  He has wept in public and in private, for friends who have fallen in combat and is unashamed.  He feels every note of the National Anthem vibrate through his body while at rigid attention, while tempering the burning desire to square-away' those around him who haven't bothered to stand, remove their hat, or even stop talking. In an odd twist, day in and day out, far from home, he defends their right to be disrespectful.  Just as did his Father, Grandfather, and Great-grandfather, he is paying the price for our freedom. Beardless or not, he is not a boy.  He is the American Fighting Man that has kept this country free for over 200 years.  He has asked nothing in return, except our friendship and understanding.  Remember him, always, for he has earned our respect and admiration with his blood.  Prayer wheel for our military...please don't break it. Please send this on after a short prayer.  Prayer Wheel  "Lord, hold our troops in your loving hands. Protect them as they protect us. Bless them and their families for the selfless acts they perform for us in our time of need. Amen."  Prayer Wheel: When you receive this, please stop for a moment and say a prayer for our ground troops in  Iraq, Afghanistan, sailors on ships, and airmen in the air, and all other that are in harm's way.  There is nothing attached.... This can be very powerful.... Just send this to all the people in your address book. Do not stop the wheel, please.... Of all the gifts you could give a US Soldier, Sailor, Marine or Airman, prayer is the very best one

      So the people that are still protesting Operation Iraqi Freedom at this point either have their heads up their asses and aren't paying much attention to what's really going on in the Middle East or...no, there is no or. I appreciate the right of all Americans to free speech, but there comes a point when free speech turns from stating one's opinion to being blatantly disrespectful and unsupportive of the government and military who are acting to defend and protect, among other things, that constiutional right to speak one's mind. The individuals who are making these arguments, either written or verbal, obviously don't appreaciate the fact that if they lived in Iraq and they were making these statements they would be killed or their female loved ones would be raped and tortured while they were forced to sit there and watch in a room full of biochemical toxins. They claim that President Bush is committing crimes against humanity but they ignore the fact that Saddam Hussein has killed and tortured THOUSANDS of his own people for saying as much in private conversation.   Freedom of Speech aside, the protests that are going on at this point are not only futile but they are disrupting the every day lives of individuals who are trying to keep this country going. We had to cancel court last night because the fucking protestors decided to hang out in front of the courthouse and we were afraid for the safety of the children who participate in our program. Wear a pin, put a sign in your window, but don't prevent justice from occurring or people from getting the help that they need. That is disgusting and a crime against freedom and the founding principles of this country. In  case the protestors forget, the right to due process is another fundamental right of the American citizens that they were preventing children from exercising for absolutely no reason other than giving themselves something to do on a Thursday night.  I love my country and the president that we elected by majority in a legitmiate election (not with the threat of murder and torture like Saddam Hussein) and it disgusts me to hear people claim that he is committing crimes against humanity or that President Bush is a warmonger. And those that are still claiming that this is all about oil at this point or that there isn't evidence that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction might want to pay attention to more than the sissy liberal rhetoric of the American media and might want to pick up a history book or a copy of UN resolution 1441 before they open their mouths and disgrace themselves or our nation even more. I stand by my statement in my last entry that if you're still protesting at this point, just go over there and take the place of an Iraqi citizen and see how your attempts to exercise your rights are greeted in a Nazi-like dictatorship in the middle east. Maybe you should pick up an old copy from the New York Times on September 12, 2001 if you need a reminder as to why it's important to act before we're acted upon.

Go USA!   ~D~ PS: People who are still wasting their breath protesting at this point are just plain obnoxious. Go over there and take the place of the Iraqi citizens that Saddam is forcing to act as human shields in order to protect his weapons of mass destruction.

      Okay, sorry for the multi-corrections emails...I told you msn was being evil...  Anyway, in case you didn't get one of those emails, Bruce and I are NOT planning a wedding...  Well, it's spring cleaning day and shopping day, but the best news of all is Bruce is finally coming home tonight.  Needless to say, I don't plan on spending much time online for the next few days.  Tootles!  D

      So now blogger is behaving itself and my email is being evil.  I tried to send this out to you all today, and I'll try again tomorrow, but for now here ya go...  Greetings all!   Sorry for the mass email, I'm going to make an end of semester resolution to stop sending these and actually keep in touch with you all individually, but we all know that, like any other resolution, this one isn't real likely to stick.   So I didn't get a chance to send a real good update in December because my grandfather passed away and things have been sheer chaos since then, so you'll have to settle for the late, quick version for now and if you email me back I'll fill you in on the details.   Well, the big news is that it is official!  Danielle is finally leaving Gainesville!!! Bruce and I are planning a move in August to the greater Orlando area.  He's going to work and try to get them to pay him to play on the computer all day long and I'm going back to school at UCF for another Master's Degree to start with and who knows what after that.  As of right now, my official move date is going to be August 9th, the day after the last day of UF's summer semester, but that may change depending on if they won't let me stay in my apartment the extra week, etc.    The most important thing that this means for those of you that are in Gainesville is that I want to try to see each and every one of you at some point or another before I leave (you wouldn't be getting this email if I didn't care about ya.)  I'd like to think that Bruce and I will have a 4th of July BBQ and/or pool party again but it depends on who all is going to be around.  (Let me know if this will definitely not work for you and we'll work something else out.)  What this means for those of you in Orlando is yippee!!  I'll  be around more than 2 weeks a year.  Woohoo!  What this means for those of you not in Orlando or Gainesville...well, if you're in Orlando, you'll have a place to stay (other than your parents' houses or Disney World.)  Other than that, it's just a chance for updated contact info for your palm pilots :)  So, as of August, here is my new contact information:  Danielle Malo  3146 Windchime Circle South  Apopka, Florida 32703  (407) 592-7847  3 important pieces of information: (1) NO!  I am not moving to Apopka, I'll be living in Seminole County that's just my mailing address.  (2) Yes, I'm going to have an actual house rather than an apartment.  With a fenced in yard...with a picket fence...and an orange tree.  It's all quite exciting. (3) As of right now, I don't intend on having a land line at my house.  I'll have my cell phone and do my best to keep it charged all the time.  I'll use my parents' number in other cases since they'll only be about a mile away.  Finally to clear up any rumors that will be/already are circulating around ASO, no, Bruce and I are planning a wedding and no we don't intend to live together when we move.  We are, however, very excited to be moving to Orlando together, and our first goal is to get Annual Passes to Disney world.  (Ryan and Avi shudder).  Well, that's the big news for now.  The rest is the same ol', same ol': Work is crazy, I am numb with stress, and Zoe still runs away if I let her out without the leash.  Some things never change.  But please keep in touch.  And email me back your contact information, I had a hard time sending out Holiday cards this year, I was missing a lot of addresses.  For those of you I haven't seen or heard from, I miss you and I hope to see you before I leave.  For those of you I only see in rare moments online, I hope that we can do a better job of staying in touch in the future.  To my interns: What are you doing reading emails from your boss during spring break?! shame on you!  Go to the beach!  Enjoy your time off.  Read this later!  Take care.  Lots of love!

      Well, the semester is almost over--THANK GOD--so I finally have some time to write. On Friday Bruce and I went to look at apartments for him in Altamonte and Maitland. The apartments are so much nicer and more appropriately priced than in Gainesville. Apparently there's some law that says that apartment complexes cant tell you if the people who live there are students or minorities. When Bruce asked if the neighborhood was quiet, one complex said they couldn't answer that either. What a pain in the ass...I'm in Orlando for Easter, and I spent the weekend tiling my house and installing plastic wood flooring in the bedrooms. I'll post some pictures soon. The walls in my house are Bliss Blue...and it's very, well...blissful. My house is going to be so awesome. On Saturday Bruce and I went with Dad to Home Depot to pick out my white fence...not a picket fence mind you, but close. We didn't get a picket one because Zoe would be less likely to escape. Then we tiled and cleaned and vacuumed and it was all very exhausting. Around noon Bruce and I met Thomas and his girlfriend Becca at Chilis for lunch. Thomas and I really need to spend more time together than 1 or 2 hours every 6 months. Sigh.  Tomorrow I'm going to spend the day at UCF spending money I don't have on things for classes I can't afford to take and meeting with several professors in the School of Social Work about getting/skipping credits and a possible source of part-time income. I'm really excited about going back to school and learning and being stressed for good reason rather than feeling like I'm beating my head against the wall.   One more weekend of tiling and then it's time for INTERIOR DESIGN! Woohoo! I'll try to take some pictures of the house and to update my website over the next few weeks...we'll see. Bruce and I have been toying with the idea of redesigning my website for about 8 months now. Who knows, I'll have more motivation to procrastinate starting in August.  Until next time...

      So as karmic punishment for slack day, I've been down for the past week with the cold from hell. I was supposed to go to Orlando this weekend to work on my house, but instead I'm vegging on the couch just a few more days, and I'll go south next weekend instead. I took some pictures of the work in progress, and I'll get them developed at some point in the near future, but you still won't be able to comprehend the transformation of the house from the nightmare it was before. My grandmother is convinced that I will never want to move out of that house once it's finished. Maybe I can take the house with me to Washington when I move there eventually.   Bruce and I went to see the Matrix yesterday. I'm still not sure whether or not I like it. The idea of it is awesome, of course, but I'm still not able to buy Keanu Reeves as any sort of intelligent being. Bruce made the point that most of the characters don't seem to have any emotions (voice, facial expressions etc) which I suppose goes along with the transcending nature of the world they've created, but it doesn't make it a good excuse for bad acting. We were more entertained by the fact that they had decorated the wall outide the theatre itself than we were by the movie. We also saw X-2 recently, which was awesome. I told Bruce yesterday that I wanted to start reading the comic books to which he replied "I just had an orgasm" in the middle of the crowded theatre waiting for the Matrix to start. I just wish it weren't so expensive to buy the original comic books. I have enough money I have to spend trying to pay off all my credit cards before I move to Orlando to become a poor college student again.  The good news is that I have a job lined up and an internship that includes a stipend at the end of the semester, so that's going to pay some of the bills. I'm just looking forward to the fact that this will be my last move for at least a couple years. The bad news is that means I have to start packing up all my crap again. Sigh.  In two weeks Bruce and I will be in DC for our anniversary which will be a nice little vaction. We're staying in Crystal City and playing tourist for a few days. Aside from being sick and having a little former-intern chaos to deal with for the past week or so, the semester is going relatively well. I'll probably be a little more sad as we get closer to July. Right now I'm just excited that everything seems to be going along according to plan. At the same time, it kind of makes me wonder how long this streak of luck will last...Never fear, the eternal pessimist is still alive and well in Gainesville.

      Greetings Bloggers and Bloggettes!  I've officially proclaimed today, Friday, May 2nd, Slack Day. I'm blogging at work, and I'm darned proud of it.  Bruce and I made plans today for a trip to Washington DC in early June. We've even bought plane tickets and booked a hotel room, so it's official.   In 2 weeks is the series finale of Dawson's Creek, and as sad as I am that it's going to end, I'm excited that it's finally in syndication, so I can watch it 80 times a day like WIll and Grace and Law and Order. I'm a little concerned that they're going to go for the cheesy worthless ending, but in honor of this momentus occasion (Slack Day, that is) Bruce and I have come up with a list of our predictions of the teaser they've been advertising that "One of these 4 will lose their lives." The four they're showing are Dawson, Jen, Joey and Pacey...So here it goes...Naturally, Bruce wrote the dirty ones...  10. Dawson dies while autoerotically asphyxiating himself in front of his Steven Spielberg shrine. Joey finds him with his ET thermos shoved up his ass.  9. Pacey is brutally murdered by Andy when she finds him in bed with Audrey. As she lunges at the bed she screams "If I can't have you, no one can!"  8. Jen overdoses at a party with Jack Osborne.  7. Dawson gets killed in a gay snuff film entitled "Dawson's Crack."  6. Pacey gets shot by the husband of the teacher he was banging back in the first season. He finally found out. It only took him 4 years.  5. Joey is electrocuted in the tub by her "personal massager."  4. Andy shoots Pacey because her dog told her that he's Satan.  3. Jen drowns...just cuz.  2. Joey falls off the ladder.  1. (and this is what we really think will happen.) Dawson dies in a car wreck and the whole series is revealed as either Joey's novel or Dawson's screenplay and the last line is something to the effect of "And that's why we call it Dawson's Creek."   Well, those our our predictions. We'll find out on May 14th for sure. The commercials are showing Joey in a wedding dress and Dawson in a tux, but I'm betting it's a dream sequence. We'll see.  Other than that, just enjoying a couple slow paced weeks until the summer semester starts. 3 months and counting until the move to Orlando and return to school. I've already ordered 2 of my text books online. Yup, I'm a dork. Deal with it.

      Holy liberal bullshit, batman!  Someone really needs to clue the Supreme Court in on a little thing called the Constitution...because that's really the only thing on which they're supposed to be basing their decisions. Not only is the court way too liberal, but it's making decisions it has no basis deciding whatsoever. Hmm...let's just go ahead and take away all of the states' power to decide law away from them. Yeah, cuz that would be...oh wait, UNCONSTITUTIONAL! And don't give me that bullshit argument that people should be able to decide what they do in their own homes...Yeah, they decide, and I end up having to counsel their kids for 6 months. What a pain in the ass.  The good news is that the morans running for the democratic ticket, don't stand a chance of standing out against each other, much less Bush, so hopefully it's only a matter of time before we see a more conservative high court. Lieberman's the only one who has had anything constructive to say thus far and despite his campaign slogans, it's not like he's been able to beat Bush in the past.  Can someone explain to me why Dale Earnhardt needs a tribute concert? Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't he a...race car driver? Why don't they have, oh, I don't know, maybe a tribute...RACE?   But at least Chante Mallard's jury made the right decision and found her guilty. Can you say, duh?  That's my rant for the day...Only 5 teen court sessions to go--tonight was AWFUL! Pictures should be up over the weekend.  ~D~

      This weekend I got the 5th Harry Potter book (and the Order of the Phoenix)...and I read the whole thing. All 800+ pages of it. Yup, I'm a dork...a dork with a headache.  I want to re-read it (I was anxious to find out who dies) before giving it a thorough review, but let's just say that I was TOTALLY shocked by who died...up until about 4 chapters before it happened, and that the meeting Harry has with Dumbledore in his office toward the end of the book made me cry. Like I said, I'm a dork.  I was almost more amused by the pandamonium at Books-A-Million on Friday night than the reading of the book, which I rushed through in an effort to finish it over the weekend. I managed to get a free hat out of it, and I intend on wearing it at the office at some point this week...Now that Lauren's onboard, I've officially felt comfortable enough to move into my rebelious phase. The long term goal is to go from wearing flipflops to work (which I started a couple weeks ago) to eventually dyeing pink streaks in my hair. :)  Well, more to come, but for now, I've gotta get my Muggle ass to bed.

        WOW!    So blogger has a new format...hmm  I'm not sure I like this. Change is bad. Especially unexpected change.  Speaking of change, my mother is trying to change up the August moving plans. Over my dead body...stay tuned for more interesting posts to follow. Huff...  There will soon be pictures from the DC trip and of my house on my website. As soon as we get paid, I'll get them developed. I have some digital camera pictures from DC, but they're at the office, so I'll wait until I get all my pictures developed and post everything at once, hopefully sometime before the weekend.  Speaking of the weekend, the new Harry Potter book is FINALLY being released. I pre-orderd it which hopefully means it will come in the mail early. The good news is that if I don't get it on time, I get it for free...and I get to use sick days to read it during the week rather than over the weekend. :)  More to come in the coming days. It would be easier if I could figure out how to post pictures on blogger...no such luck thus far.   I'm also hoping to get my website up and running after summer B starts. Lauren is finally starting as our Staff Assistant on Wednesday (THANK GOD!!) so I'll actually be able to work only 8 hours a day and not have to feel like I have 10 hours of work waiting for me when I get in the next morning.

      Only 4 days until I can say "I don't rent an apartment, I own a house!" Woohoo!....well, actually, I'm already a homeowner...it's just that I won't be living in an apartment 4 days from now.  I'll be in transition (aka living in sin with Bruce) until August 8th and then it's off to Orlando!  What sucks is that I won't be able to really unpack until September since the Valestons won't close on thier house for another month. But I won't have an 8 year old child stomping up the stairs on the other side of my living room wall anymore, and I won't have to pay another security deposit!  Homeownership rules!

      Only 3 weeks left and I'm packing my ASS off! What a way to spend a weekend. The good news is that with all the dust flying around, I'll probably get a sinus infection and will be able to use some of the 150 HOURS of sick time I have saved up that I'm not going to get paid for when I leave.  With Bruce in South Florida to visit his parents, I have less excuses to put off packing. Unfortunately, I've run out of boxes and I'm now resorting to packing things I can fit in bags and suticases. But hey, at least the Superstation is playing Predator again!

      WOW! What a whirlwind couple of weeks.  2 weeks ago, Vicky and I went to see Matchbox 20 in Orlando.  They were AWESOME! What's better than hearing Matchbox 20 live in concert? Hearing Matchbox 20 cover "Where the Streets Have No Name" live right after watching Mark and the hotties from Sugar Ray rock out as an "opening" act!  Damn, that show was awesome.  Follow that by our 4th of July BBQ/Farewell to Gainesville party. TONS of food, TONS of friends and a good time had by all!   Last week was the week of insanity at work but we finally figured out who my replacement at work will be unless she lies on the polygraph or fails the drug test, which she won't because she's Sharemah and she ROCKS!  Then this weekend it was off to Orlando for UNPACKING and the Summer Sanitarium Tour. You're reading the blog of someone who touched Fred Durst on Sunday. The concert was awesome, although I was a little skeptical after Mudvein...We got rained on 4 different times and we were soaked to the bone...and then it got cold, but the concert was worth it. I still can't hear a thing.  So add going to awesome concerts more often to the list of things I'm looking forward to about leaving Gainesville.  For now it's off to Bruce's house for chicken and rice. He's turning 27 tomorrow...my boyfriend's an old fart!  Dannie

      Nonsensical rules of UCF MSW Field Placement: (1) Even if you have done all of your required hours for the semester, your site can require that you work over the Christmas holiday, so don't plan on going out of town or having an actual vacation during the next two winter breaks...Oh yeah, and you don't get a Spring Break either...But don't expect us to pay you.  (2) If you get injured at your internship, you're not covered by Workers' Comp because you're not an employee and you're not covered by the UCF insurance either, so I hope you have your own health insurance to cover any injuries...oh yeah, and home visits are a mandatory part of the experience.  (3) If you want to do your internship at your job, you have to get them to give you another position so you can learn something, and you have to write a paper about it...oh yeah, and we prefer if you don't get paid for that either.  (4) If you want to spend even more time at your internship than we require, you can take an Incomplete for the year.  (5) Get over the fact that no one here will get all A's...  ...Over my dead body. It's gonna be a hell of a semester, folks.

      So Mike V brought it to my attention that I never blogged about my last week in Gainesville...it was pretty hectic, but here's a rundown.  Monday-I was supposed to teach in Dr. Swett's class but things got to hectic, had the 2nd-to-last session with a client I've been counseling for 8 months run overtime and realized there was no way in hell I was going to get everything on my "to-do" list done by Friday, so I said screw it and skipped class (the ghosts of rehab past rear their ugly heads.) Come to find out, everyone else who was supposed to be there skipped it, too. Sorry, Dr. Swett! To my defense, she didn't let me know until the week before when her class was and I had already scheduled sessions that day. Otherwise, I probably could have made it. Had dinner with Tina at Nero's Monday night. It was nice to catch up. You know it's been a while since you've seen someone when they're like "wow, you have hair!" Sigh.  Tuesday-my farewell luncheon at the Sheriff's Office. In a classic ASO gesture, hardly anyone I actually work with showed up. Only 1 of my current interns, but 3 of my teen court volunteers which was so nice. Props to Jason, Vicky, Amanda, Jing, Yan, Scott, Bruce, Jill, Kris, Lt. Fundenburg, Sgt. Gerard, Mr. Sam Stafford, Cindy, John Richman, and Lauren for the fancy plaque. You all know how I love my trophies. Tuesday night was...I don't really remember Tuesday night. Like I said it was a crazy week. Oh, yeah, and it was also Sharemah's birthday.  Wednesday was a day to begin tying up loose ends. Not much exciting happened that I recall. Just getting ready for the week to end and beginning to pack up my office. You know, a pack rat like me can accumulate a lot of shit working at the same place for almost 3 years...especially after they gave me an office with a door. I think today was the only day I actually got to have lunch with Bruce. I also terminated with that client I mentioned. He gave me a plant because I "helped him grow." I told him he helped me grow, too. Then to demonstrate what a grown up I am, I bleached and put bright red highlights in my hair! :)  Thursday was an emotional train wreck. It was my last Teen Court, so my dad was the judge which was kind of cool. I know he got a kick out of my having to call him "Your Honor" all night. :) The kids made me cry. They brought me presents, gave me lots of hugs and made speeches about me. I hate to quote bad movies but "They gave me candy and called me the light." Only unlike in Dangerous Minds I didn't stay. They made me cry and all gave me a big group hug which only made me cry some more. I love my attorneys. I have lots of thank you notes to write. Then we had our end of semester dinner at Rigatelli's. The dinner wasn't great, but the company was. In addition to all my interns (minus Amanda who went to Melting Pot instead--can't blame her), my dad came, Elizabeth B., Maggie, Jill, Jason and Lauren of course, Lauren brought John, Gretchen brought Seth, Adrian brought Katrina, and "Mom" brought "Dad". We gave Lateria her Mommy-to-be gift and Adrian sang "It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday" and made a lovely speech.  Friday was total madness. I don't even remember what I did on Friday. Lauren and Jason took me to lunch at Cafe Gardens for Sweet Potato Fries, which was a nice change from Taco Bell and Publix grocery lunches I'm used to. Then I had to finish up with all my counselors, do their exit interviews, do their end-of-semeter paperwork, have my exit interview with HR, run around and turn in my pager, keys, IDs, and get a bunch of forms signed. "Have you turned in your glock?" I chickened out on the exit interview and decided to write it instead. I wanted time to let things sink in and really think about the good of the program before I answered any of the questions on that form in detail. So Friday was a rough day, but I'm still happy about my decision to leave. Friday night Bruce and I went to Books-A-Million and blew the gift card Gretchen got me as a farewell gift (I really should leave jobs more often!) and also bought Harry Potter trading cards which have become our new obsession.  Saturday was the day Maggie came home, but the adventure of getting her was a story in and of itself...  So Bruce's car makes a lot of noise...all the time. But we're driving down 34th street and we're like "is it me, or does the car sound noisier than usual today?" So instead of stopping to check it out, we thought it would be mroe productive to mimic the sounds the car makes instead. Until we got to the mall and the car started making really loud noises and bumping along the road. We pulled into the Mall parking lot and Bruce's car had "pulled a firestone". So seeing as neither one of us had ever changed a tire before (memories of Josh Heller changing the tire on my car at the airport in Jax at 1am after DSR our Freshman year) and that Bruce's spare was buried under all my stuff from moving, floating in some odd liquid and was rusted, it took us an hour and a half to change the damn tire. So we got to Petsmart about 20 minutes before the animals for adoption were going home for the week, found Maggs and fell in love with her aat first sight. The rest of the night was spent hanging out and playing with our new kitten and preparing ourselves for my move.  So that was my last week in Gainesville in a nutshell. It was totally crazy and I'm sure I've left a bunch of stuff out, and I'm sorry if you're reading this and I left you out personally, but at this point everything is still a blur. I think I still think I'm just on vacation and at some point I'll have to put on my suit and head for the courthouse.  More about life in Orlando after I finsih unpacking. I'll finish the kitchen tomorrow and put my bed together in the afternoon. It's all very exciting!  ~D~

        Close Encounter of the Feline Kind...    Maggie had her first encounter with Frank and Zoe last night. Surprisingly, she and Frank seem to be doing okay, but she scared the shit out of Zoe, who now cries every time anyone goes near the bathroom.   Today really begins the unpacking, as I need to get my room empty before I can put my bed together and actually start living in my house.   At some point this week I'll be overhauling my entire site. Stay tune for bigger and better things to follow!  ~D~

      We have a new addition to our little family:  Margaret Alleyson Malo-Doskocil aka Maggie. She's an orange and white kitten and is just as cute as can be. Aside from attacking her own poo in the litterbox a few moments ago she seems pretty bright. Her favorite hobbies after day one include tearing around Bruce's music room, climbing on Mommy's legs and shaq-attacking the litterbox. Pictures are up!   www.geocities.com/zoeandfrank/Maggie.html

      The goodbyes have begun...  Or at least the farewells to life in Gainesville. So far it's been Kellie, Heather L. & Taylor R.   I finally made it out of the apartment at 1:30 am on Friday. The good news is that I'm getting my full deposit back from Brookwood Terrace. If anyone is looking for a place to live in Gainesville, I highly recommend them. The staff is wonderful and they're not trying to rip people off, which is a nice change from Treehouse Village, University Place, Legacy, & Grantwood.  This next week is going to be super-overwhelming, so I'm apologizing now for my behavior...mostly to Bruce who has already had to put up with his share of screaming, crying and dramatic mood swings...even more so than usual.  Thursday night we had Amanda's Naughty & Nice Bridal Shower "Excuse me, do you have a condom?" Yes...here's one that's a brand no one has ever heard of, it doesn't have an expiration date...oh yeah, and it's half-way ripped open. Enjoy!   More news as the week continues, and hopefully some new house pictures before too long.  ~D~

      So I've been a little...busy this semester. I'm taking 18 credits, working 10 hours a week, and doing 14 hours/week at my internship, not to mention that I've been trying to get Bruce moved down here (he finally got his apartment today!) so things have been a little...hectic. I still haven't gotten the house unpacked or any decor put up, and Nadine is coming from Germany next week. I haven't even had a chance to read anyone else's blog in the past 2 months. But I do miss you guys, so email when you get a chance. That really is the best way to actually get in touch with me. My response may be short and somewhat nonsensical, but at least you'll know that I really do care. :)  School is really nuts, especially now that we've hit that midsemester point when all our papers are do. I have like 30 pages to write this weekend. It's really not going to be a fun time.   Congratulations to Christy and Jason who got engaged last week (it's about damn time!) I'm going to be a bridesmaid twice in the next year...does this qualify me for always a bridesmaid never a bride?   Well, I just got done with a 12 hour day at UCF, and Bruce and I are going to dinner, but I did want to let you all know that I am, in fact, still alive.   Love, Dannie

      Ah...I missed the drama of having home internet. I knew that it would change my life. So far I've had an ex boyfriend tell me he's in love with me, 2 say they were living in Orlando now, and 1 tell me that I'm going to hell. AOL Instant Messenger, how I missed you!  Finals are this week. Wish me luck. Then it's time for website updates,digital pictures, more frequent blogging, and maybe even a clean house! Exciting stuff to come!

      Wow...It's been forever...I wasn't even sure this site was still up, or that I would be able to remember the password.  So lessee...How do I catch whoever is sad enough to still be checking this poor neglected website after 6 months?  School sucks...I really hate it. I'm not just bitching and moaning like I did at UF...It really sucks. For a wide variety of reasons which I will go into during future posts. To give you an idea here's a brief preview... 1) white folks don't have ethnicity 2) our professors have to ask us how to spell the months of the year 3) I've written more papers on movies than on clinical issues 4) The Golden Rule of Social Work="Cover Your Ass"  Other than that...I'm going to Russia this summer, we're getting a hot tub in a few weeks, Bruce and I are planning a cruise too, I'm in Katie and Shawn's wedding in August and Christy and Jason's next March, I now have 4 animals (2 dogs and 2 cats) and I still haven't taken any pictures of my house since it's been renovated.  Oh yeah, and I finally have internet and a phone line after living in this house for almost a year.  That's it for now...I unfortunately still have finals to study for.   Hopefully there will be many website changes in the near future, now that I don't have to drive to UCF to check my email. :)

      Snoelle's Great Escapes...  Twice this week Snoelle has tried to run away. The first time she got as far as the back porch and waited quietly while Mommy had a brief hissy fit and scooped her up for a nice long cuddle on the couch.  Today "Grampa" brought over an onion so I could Crock Pot some Arroz con Pollo for dinner and Snoelle dashed out the front door like a white streak of lightening...This time there was a lot more chasing and cornering involved in getting the White Wonder back into the house where she belongs. If there were to be a silver lining in these incidents it's that Maggie is not the one running away. Not only is Maggs faster, she also refuses to wear a collar.  I guess it's true what they say: You can take the cat out of the street, but you can't take the street out of the cat...   .

      For the first time ever I almost wish I lived outside the U.S.  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban opens tomorrow in Britain, and I still have to wait until Thursday night. Sigh. A group of us are going to the first showing at the Winter Park Village at 12:01 am on Thursday. Those of us who are REALLY dorks are wearing costumes. Of course I'll post pictures!  For no reason other than I am an awesome girlfriend, I received a beautiful diamond pendant and the new Harry Potter PC game from my hottie boyfriend Bruce last night. He definitely wins the most awesome boyfriend in the world award. My favorite part was when he hands me the jewelry box he prefaces it with "it's not an engagement ring." Ah, baby... :)

      The Russia trip is only a month away and I am getting more and more anxious by the minute.  urlLink Here' s the hotel we're staying at in Moscow. It's really well located near all the terrorist targets in the nation's capital.  To prepare I've been listening to the soundtrack to the musical Chess, listening to ineffective "learn russian in your car" CDs, and gaping at my Russian quick guide to customs and etiquette. I can't believe there are A LOT of students going on this trip who are making no attempt to learn the language. The Cyrillic alphabet is  KILLING  me, but at least I'm trying!  In the meantime, I'm finishing up my Hogwarts' student robes and preparing for the big premiere next weekend!

      Obsessively stuffing long-craved Chinese food down my gullet, I thought missed the President's speech tonight because of hunger (no more kidney pills, the appetite is back!) Then I realized the idiot liberals who run the major networks decided not to carry the speech anyway. And some (ahem, Mom) would argue that there is no political agenda in the media. Puhleeze. God forbid, they should carry an important speech that spells out the Administration's plans regarding Iraq, they might actually have to stop accusing the President of having "no official plan". Thanks to  urlLink FOX News  for reprinting the speech in it's entirety on their site for those of us who know that agenda setting goes beyond the textbooks in Communication for Dummies.

      If I were a man I would marry Ann Coulter. I love how she puts the squeaky little sissy liberal commentators in their place on Hannity and Colmes. It's so nice to know that there really are intelligent women out there writing worthwhile non-fiction and speaking on news shows without resorting to personal attacks.   Kerry earned himself yet another foot-in-mouth award for his little comment about the President's mountain biking accident yesterday. Just goes to show that he really is an ignorant, insensitive, incindeary prick. Just remember, boys and girls, "Kerry is scary, Kerry is scary."  :)  Political commentary aside, I'm happy to say that tomorrow morning I will be taking my last antibiotic, and I've been sitting at the computer for nearly 2 hours now without any pain. And I drove myself to Walmart to buy ice cream bars and cat food. It's been an exciting day.

      So I check my blog today and the ads at the top were for Harry Potter merchandise! How appropriate. I've been getting in all those ebay items I blew all my money on and now it's like Christmas every day.  Bruce and I went on our cruise this weekend and it was great...until I fell so ill the third day that I had to be taken off the boat in a wheelchair on Sunday morning. We thought it was a flu because I was all achy and feverish. Then my fever spiked to 103.5 and I couldn't move and I was shaking all over saying I was freezing and crying because I was afraid I was going to die. Turns out I have a pretty severe kidney and bladder infection. Fun stuff. Thankfully my doctor doesn't know I'm sitting up at the computer(for the first time in 5 days) writing my blog.   You know, I just wasn't getting enough attention this weekend. :) Bruce and I had a good time in Nassau and we'll defintely be going on another cruise in the future...with better medical supplies on hand. Alright, 3 paragraphs and I'm exhausted. Time to go back to laying on the couch watching re-runs of The West Wing. Pictures and details (not too many, don't worry) from the cruise to follow.  ~D~

      Blogger has a dandy new, even more user-friendly format. I love it! I love it! God, I think that's an inside joke from drama class in high school...which means no one reading this will get it. Hmm...  Tomorrow Bruce and I leave for our Cruise to the Bahamas. No, Ryan, we will  not  be getting married while we're there...you need three days in the bahamas and a blood test for that. :)  Back to packing. Then a few hours sleep...hopefully. Cheers!  Harry Potter Quote of the Day:   "From that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a 12 foot mountain troll is one of them..."    --Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone aka Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.

      Hello, my name is Dannie and I'm an eBay addict. :::Hi, Dannie:::   This is a smoke free meeting with no eating or drinking unless you can do it without being caught. We need people to help man the hotline this weekend. (See, no one reading this will actually understand why this is funny because they weren't forced to attend AA meetings for a stupid substance abuse class last semester.)  I have spent over $100 on eBay in the past 7 days. It has been...2 minutes since my last bid. I have the unfortunate habit of winning nearly everything I bid on. I also have the unfortunate habit of collecting Harry Potter memorabilia. I've recently been quoted as saying "I can't wait to live in Russia so that I can buy Russian Harry Potter merchandise." The worst part about my addiction is that I have no desire to quit...Even though I know I should save my money for study abroad. (you're studying a broad? Why not study a guy?)  So anyway, the point is that I'm spending way too much time and money on eBay now that I'm on vacation. See, bad things happen when I'm neither overworked nor underpaid! Just goes to show, I NEED to be busy, stressed, and broke!

      Wow, two blogs in 24 hours? I must be insane.  Actually, I'm just enjoying having time to sit on my ass and not do anything this week.  So far today I slept in until 1, got up, ate, talkled to Bruce, re-read some Harry Potter stuff, surfed the web, laid around some more, and now I'm contemplating maybe getting dressed and going to walmart or something.   I added a  urlLink links  page to my website last night, but it's still in the works. Also, as you can see, you now have the ability to comment so that I know someone might actually be reading this drivel! Happy blogging!

      Another week without posting. I'll get back into the habit of it eventually. I've actually been online quite a bit lately, as some of you know. But I've been spending most of my time playing The Sims. I know, it's sad. But the new game comes out next month and I figured what the hell, might as well get sick of the old one first.  Bruce and I bought our first major piece of artwork for the house this week.   . Okay, so actually I bought it, he hung it up...then my dad re-hung it because we couldn't hang it straight.   urlLink zoeandfrank  is in the middle of a major overhaul this week. Hopefully Bruce and I will be buying some real webspace in the near future. Now that he's got an awesome job, he has all these plans to buy cool stuff, so the website is a little ways down the list: after Disney year round passes and jewlery for yours truly! :)  In the meantime enjoy the changes and the new pictures!  ~Dannie~

More tomorrow perhaps. I'm out of internet time for now.  Dosvidaniya!  ~D~

      Greetings from Russia!  Holy Crap I'm tired! It's 18:47 our time which means its 10:47 most of your time. I haven't slept since Sunday night, everyone here pretends they can't speak ENglish until they think we can't hear them, and half of us are already sick from the food...Oh yeah, adn an hour after we checked into the hotel, our professor took us out to the Red Square and left us to fend for ourselves. But hey, this is supposed to be an adventure, right? It only took me 8 hours in Russia to find an Internet cafe!  More later.  ~D~

      So I'm having a bit of a day...  The folks from The Grove called to cheerfully inform me that I no longer have a job/internship for the Fall, which means not only do I have no way to pay bills and eat come August, but also that I don't have an internship site. I would have time to correct this problem except, oh wait, that's right I'm leaving the COUNTRY in three days! UGH!  Thanks to Shawn for listening to my bitching and moaning this afternoon. Thanks to Bruce in advance for listening to it tonight.   I'm about one more social work irritant away from dropping the goddamn program at this point.  Cheers!  ~D~

      I am convinced that my body is trying to tell me not to go to Russia.  First there was the kidney infection from hell... Then I had bloody noses every day until I broke down and paid nearly $80 for my allegra prescription... Now I have a blocked, painful ear. To top it all off, I'm anticipating a weekend forecast of cramps and bloating, which will make for a very long and uncomfortable plane ride come Monday afternoon.  Maybe my body is just rebelling against writing the stupid pre-travel paper, which I still haven't started. Well, I wrote out a title page and subheadings.  Still haven't picked up the Russian flashcards I made, still haven't learned a damn thing about the language. Bruce's new thing is quizzing me on Russian words: "How do you say help?" "I don't know, but I have flashcards..." "Okay, then how do you say police?" "I don't know, but I have flashcards..." I also haven't found a voltage adapter. I figure since Bruce won't be around, I won't have to look my usual gorgeous (t-shirt and jeans and pulled back hair) self, so I can go without the curling iron and hair dryer (that are still packed from the cruise.)

      "Some people's idea of free speech is that they are free to say anything they like,but if anyone says anything back, that is an outrage." --Winston Churchill    Reasons Im not a feminist:    1) I dont need special rules or considerations because Im a girl.  2) Equality is an individuals rights not a genders.  3) Being a bitch doesnt make you right.  4) A feminist is a reverse-chauvinist in a skirtor rather in pantsfor the sole purpose of defending their right to wear pants.  5) Theres nothing wrong with staying at home and taking care of the kids. If you want kids, its a privilege to be the one to make sure theyre properly raised.  6) For some reason there is a male-bashing requirement to join that clubGuys rockwithout them wed have to change our own tires, open our own doors, and pay for our own dinnersI  can  do these things, but I   dont want   to.   7) Theres nothing wrong with being a girl! Okay, I hate my period as much as any of them, but Im not going to go around announcing it to the world out of anger.   8) Feminists think theres a double standard between mens role and womens roles. I say theres a double standard between claiming we have role overload and wanting to have so many roles. Here are some double standards for you: why are there womens studies but not mens studies? Why does the court arrest men for not paying child support but not arrest women who dont comply with visitation? Why can the courts force men to pay child support but its a womans choice whether or not to have the child in the first place?

      Bru and I have a new favorite  urlLink band .   Be sure to listen to the MP3. Bruce and I are going to train Zoe and Frank to sing Jessica Simpson songs. We'll make millions.  So I turned in my first late assignment since starting at UCF tonight. It was due at midnight and I posted at 12:52. Sigh. I'm such a slacker. :)   urlLink Marie  and I spent the day discussing how much better we are than everyone else. I feel so bad for people that come into contact with us in the lab. We really are research bitches.  In an interview on CBS, Teresa Heinz Kerry (he could only be married to a hypocrite as big as himself!) was quoted as saying "I'm cheeky, I'm sexy, whatever."      urlLink     Such an intelligent and eloquent woman, isn't she? I want to know who in their right mind would find her sexy?! I think this would have been the more appropriate quote to accompany the picture...  "I'd like to be a dog," she says to a group of pre-schoolers. "Do you know why? Wouldn't you like to be a dog? I would. Dogs are friendly." Ah, honey, all that money, and look! Your wish came true!   See, sweetie, the problem is to be first lady, you actually have to be a lady!      urlLink      You go on being cheeky, there in your gas guzzling, party-switching house on the hill, Teresa.   Sorry, had to get that out of my system...  Tomorrow I have to write a 5 page paper on my expectations for Russia...Any thoughts? Do I include that I'm terrified and I don't want to go?  ~D~

      Substance-related disorder of the day: Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome        Occurs when someone dies suddenly after the first use of inhalants.  Let that be a lesson to you kids...don't sniff inhalants or you could die...of course, you only get SDS if you die the first time you use inhalants. So if you make it past the first use, you're okay. :)  Went on a road trip with Mom, Dad, Zoe and Frank this weekend for Pop Pop Bill's 90th birthday. I took so many great pictures that they warranted their own  urlLink site .   urlLink      Two weeks from now I'll be in Russia...if the plane doesn't crash and I make it through customs, and no one attacks me...Alright, back to work.  ~D~

      Brudle just took the HP kid quiz and ended up with...      urlLink  Which HP Kid Are You?     At first he was like "Pssh! I'm not Ron Weasley" (and he really made that sound) but then he was all "wait, doesn't Ron end up with Hermione?...Awwww."  This is one of the many reasons why I love him. :)  ~D~

      One thing I won't be doing while in Russia is attending a Russian rock concert...  I'm at work right now listening to a Russian rock internet radio station...it sucks. It's like 80s death metal on depressants and tone-deaf pills. Give me my Metallica and Limp Bizkit, and leave the werahkjberbfj music at home.  Note:  that's not actually the name of any Russian music because, of course, the name would use the Cyrillic (aka Satan's) alphabet. Russian in our alphabet involves a lot of consonants and spit. :)  This weekend I'm off to North Carolina for Pop Pop Bill's 90th birthday. Sheesh...90 years old. I can't imagine.  Bruce and I celebrated our 2nd anniversary yesterday. I gave him a straight-girl-eye for the straight guy make over (I cleaned and organized his apartment...or as he says "anal-retentive-girl-afied it), and he took me out for a very posh dinner at The Melting Pot. It was a lovely but exhausting day.  I know my blogs lately have been even less interesting than usual. It's not that I've been busy exactly. Just playing an excessive amount of video games. :) At some point there will be the following:  1) pictures from the cruise 2) pictures and a review for Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban 3) a new blog for my trip to Russia  Until then just visit the regular  urlLink site . And send me comments! I feel so ignored! :(

      Thoughts I have when I can't sleep even though I have to work AND attend a midnight premiere of Harry Potter tomorrow...  1) I wonder if I will come back from Russia alive 2) Do I have enough clothes that don't have words in English so I won't be easily targeted as being an American while overseas? 3) Which is worse: being killed by Terrorists while abroad because I'm an American or coming back alive because I denied my citizenship? 4) Is it too late to back out of study abroad? 5) If my gut is telling me not to go, and my parents are telling me not to go, and I know Bruce doesn't want me to go even though he hasn't said so, why am I still planning to study abroad?  If anyone can help get these questions off my mind in the next 26 days, that would be really really appreciated.

      Today, the moral of the story, boys and girls, is to watch your spelling.  Apparently http://zoeandfrank.blogpot.com is the home of Aaron's Bible Page. I would put a link here, but I don't want to condone that kind of delinquency. :)  My computer and I are in a battle that apparently is resulting in my having to replace my motherboard. All so that I can play the Sims over and over again until the new game comes out in September.  On an upnote, after tomorrow I will have hopefully learned two more A's, thus maintaining the surprisingly rare UCF Social Work 4.0  This time next week I will have just returned from visiting Thomas and Christy.

      Welcome to the UCF School of Social Work Graduate Research Assistant Lab: Where we get paid to no nothing whatsoever!  Actually today we accomplish the task of stealing books from the professor down the hall that just quit. And singing showtunes and looking at 135 dollars worth of pictures from Russia. :)  But now I'm going home to not do work in front of the tv.

      Dobry dien!  That's not actually how you spell good afternoon, but it's what it means.   I'm officially ready to come home. I've been sick from the food every day since gettnig to Volgograd, my roommate gets up a 4:30 in the morning (after coming in after midnight) and makes lots of noise, and we are dependent on a huge bus to take us around and all the girls want to stop to shop on the way home every day.  Dad just sent me pictures of the pups so now I'm even more homesick.  Tonight I got to go to the Russian firestation adn sit in teh fire truck wearing a helmit with the sirens going. It was pretty cool. There will be pictures up as soon as I get back!  Dosvidaniya!  D

      Yesterday we had a round table discussion with the Russian cadets at the Law Academy and all of us. And they opened the floor for questions. So of course the first question was regarding the War in Iraq. And of course Dr. Maiden aka the liberal bastard that runs the social work department decides to answer...using the word "we". As in "we" feel like this war never should have happened now that "we" know that there are no weapons of mass destruction and many of "us" feel that he's not the real president anyway.  Maybe it's just me but there is a time and place for a bit of tongue biting and patriotism...like when you're serving as an ambassador of your country to a bunch of future militia members of an ally nation. Maybe it's just me, but I was really disgusted. I can't stand the fact that he represents our university, much less our country.  So immediately afterward we broke into small groups because there were like 60 people in the room and it wasn't much of a round table and I and several of the criminal justice students clarified that not everyone shares that opinion.   Funny internet cafe moment:  One of the girls is trying to talk to the employee and says in the middle of the room where about 6 of us students are emailing, "does anyone know how to say bathroom in Russian?" And we all say simultaneously "TOILET!" I feel so bad for the Russians who are using the cafe with us. I know our guides must be saying "Monday can't get here soon enough!"  We've decided that we're going to take pictures of all the crazy toilets here and make a coffee table book of Russian public restrooms. We're going to make millions.

      We're almost half way through this experience...I can't believe we've only been here 6 days. It feels like it has been forever.  Since leaving Moscow things have been crazy. On our last day, I made the mistake of attempting to visit the internet cafe by myself. I walked around red square because it was blocked off...and I walked right into a huge communist protest outside the Kremlin. After all that, the internet cafe wasn't even open. Luckily I ran into some other students who were out and about so I didn't have to walk BACK through the protest by myself. Of course, they had to stop and take pictures in the middle of the rally. Meanwhile I'm thinking "don't make eye contact, don't speak English, just keep walking!"  The train was a nightmare. I was rooming in a cabin about 5 feet by 6 feet and there were 4 of us...the other three girls included the one who ditched me to room at the hotel in Moscow and they are...Let's say high maintenance. That is, they brought 2 rolling bag carry ons and 2 suitcases larger than mine each. Keep in mind we had to keep our luggage in our cabins on the train. It was an experience.  Also on the train while I was napping everyone got very drunk and were throwing up in the spaces between the train cars. I was so sorry that I missed that experience. Last night at dinner Dr. Maiden got so drunk he threw up at the table and had to be carried to the car. I'm so glad I discovered that my camera allows me to take video (thanks Mom and Dad!!) Then we had our own little adventure getting back to the hotel because the bus left us there and we had no idea where we were going.   Volgograd is much better than Moscow. The people are so nice here and they try to speak English and give directions. They don't seem to hate Americans at all whereas the people in Moscow just glared and pretended not to speak English.  Tomorrow they are having a huge welcoming ceremony with the media and everything, so I'll have to figure out newspaper and TV websites and let you all know.   Write when you have time, I will try to post as often as my schedule permits.  Dosvidaniya!  Danielle

      I know this email is a week late, but I had SUCH fun last weekend hanging out with Christy and Thomas in Charlotte. Bruce and I are seriously thinking of moving up there...In fact, I think that the majority of the Rehab Counseling Masters Class of 2001 should consider moving there...with a few exceptions. :)  Here are some pictures from my trip...   &nbsp;  urlLink     &nbsp;  urlLink     &nbsp;  urlLink     &nbsp;  urlLink     &nbsp;  urlLink     &nbsp;  urlLink
