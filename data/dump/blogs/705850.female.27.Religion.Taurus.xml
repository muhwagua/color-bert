       BOOKS   I finished  The Visitation .  It's by Frank Peretti.  It was very good.  Not a quick read.  Not a light read.  If you've never read a Peretti book, let me fill you in a bit.  Peretti is a Christian author and he mostly writes books that are fiction.  He mainly writes about the supernatural and the spiritual warfare that is constantly going on around us.  This book differs from his previous (This Present Darkness; Piercing the Darkness; The Prophet; and The Oath, to name a few) books by the fact that there isn't a separation between the spiritual world and the physical world. (If you read one of his previous books and this book, you'll understand better :)  ANYWAY, this book revolves around Travis Jordan, a pastor who has run aground spiritually.  He's tired of all the "stuff" that goes with the church and religion and so he throws in the towel basically.  The only problem is that a self-proclaimed prophet comes trotting into town performing miracles and deceiving the entire town.  Whether Jordan wants to be or not, he's drawn into the mess and while figuring out the truth, comes to some major revelations of his own life and his own relationship with Jesus Christ.    If you're looking for a light, romantic, "feel-good" book, don't read this one.  If you're looking for something thought-provoking, intriguing, with a great plot and story flow, than this is the one for you! :)    I'm still reading  For Better or For Best  by Gary Smalley.  I've read this one a couple of times before, but I can always use the reminders! (like: Don't be a nag!--ha ha)  (Josh, do not comment..lol)  Anyway, I'm only on chapter 4, but since I've finished my fiction book, I will have a bit more time to read my non-fiction book.  I don't know why it is, but I can fly through any fiction that you give me, but non-fiction I struggle to make it through a chapter a day.  This book by Smalley has some really good material, but you have really got to want to improve your relationship for any of the suggestions to work.  It takes time and patience (all marriages take that anyway!), but it's good stuff, good stuff to think about and work through.  My next fictional pick is   The Warning  by T. Davis Bunn.  I've read a few of the books he has written with Janette Oke, but never anything he's done on his own.  The book was suggested to me by an aquaintance who has similar tastes in books, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I think it's the first book of a series.  I'll let you know :)   THOUGHTS FOR TODAY   Why does watermelon have white seeds and black seeds?  Are the white seeds developing into black seeds or are they two completely separate things?  I know that's not deep, but that's my thoughts for today :)  lol.  It's late, I'm tired.  Thanks for reading..feel free to sound off!

           Well, It's me again. As I sat here the other day I began thinking to myself,  What is a Blog?  What should I Blog about?  Who is gonna read my Blog?  Among several other ideas  (which I may decide to do as well)  I've decide to just Blog the first thing on my mind when i sit down  (in this very uncomfortable chair)  at the computer. Then just ramble on for a bit and see what comes out.       If anyone reading this knows me personally in real life  you will know that Shawna and I are two very different people. She can type and comunicate her views and thoughts easily, I on the other hand am not so gifted. So my plan is to try and be a litte less serious about my blogging. Don't get me wrong, I share many of her views, but may not express them in my blog.       So with that said I have nothing left on my mind, cause well it's almost midnight and I'm very tired, so I'm going to bed :)   C-Ya tomorrow  Signing off,     Josh

      Hello!    Just so you know, my husband and I decided to join forces and so now it's "our thoughts" instead of "my thoughts"!  :)  Hope you enjoy!   PARTY  Well, the party was...different.  I felt bad, my daughter and I were the only ones who showed up.  Well unless you count the neighbor family that kind of "crashed" the party.  The little girl was ecstatic that we were there and the mom was truly thankful.  I'm glad we went.  Though their lifestyle is really different from mine, which in turn makes it difficult to connect.  As I sat throughout the afternoon (I decided not to swim regardless of what everyone else was doing--go me! :)), I kept asking God what I was doing here. This was definitely not the type of influence I wanted on my daughter.  But what was the alternative?  To subject my daughter to the influence of me saying these people are not "like us" and so we shouldn't go out of our way to hang out with them? Hmm tough call.  Some would say that we have to protect our children and keep them away from those elements that might endanger them or tempt them into another lifestyle contrary to God's word.  But as I look at my daughter's innocent face who found no fault in the way these people lived, kept their house, and talked, I realized that she has been given the gift to look at them as people. Just people she would like the chance to know better.  And I felt ashamed.  Because what good am I to my daughter if I constantly shield her from all the possible "negative" influences?  The negative influences are ALWAYS going to be there to face.  I need to be teaching her how to handle the negative influences, the differences and to learn to find ways to bridge those gaps and make connections to those who are different from us.  All in the effort to love them as Jesus would so that hopefully one day they will come to know Jesus the way we do.  That's what it's about.  It's about loving people the way Christ did so they can know Him too.  And what better way to help my daughter learn than to come alongside her in the friendship she has began with this little girl and be there beside her as she is in the midst of the "negatives" so I can help her to stand for what she believes without being judgmental and without compromising?   As we were leaving the party, my daughter blurts out "When can we come back and swim again?" to which I smiled and said, "Whenever they ask us to."  And the mom looks at me and says, "Maybe I'll give you a call next week?".  And I say, "That would be great."  And I mean it.   I'm one step closer to my goal.  I recognized the opportunity God gave me and I do hope that the mom gives me a call and I have to find the courage to embrace this opportunity.  I'm glad God's ways are different from mine.  I'm thankful that He is constantly pushing me and challenging me and creating a desire within me to learn about His ways and His desires.  The changes are difficult and slow and often times met with a bit of grumbling.  But I'm always pleasantly surprised at how it all turns out.  Thanks God for loving me enough not to be satisfied with where I'm at but to want me to press on. (See Hebrews chapter 12 for more on "pressing on" and receiving God's discipline)  See ya tomorrow!

      Today I'm taking my daughter to a birthday party.  Pool Party that is.  What great fun.  I get to stand around with people I don't know and generally feel like a doofus.  Which might surprise some people because if you know me, I'm generally a very friendly person who is very outgoing.  Well the catch is, I'm outgoing on my turf!  If it's my party or a party I put together or at a place I'm familiar with, I can chat up a storm.  But if I'm walking into a place I've never been before or if I'm surrounded by people I don't know and they all seem to know one another, I immediately feel like a doofus.  It's intimidating.  I want the upper hand.  I want to be able to be the one who can mix and mingle and make everyone else feel comfortable, not try to figure out how  I  can feel comfortable.  Ugh.  But I will go, and I will probably have a decent time--think positive right?  And what's up with the fact that it wasn't stated whether parents are supposed to swim?  If I go in my suit and no other adult is, I'm going to feel really silly.  But if I don't go in my suit and everyone else IS wearing their suit then what?  ugh..I thought I was through with  trying to fit in since I graduated from high school..never changes does it?  I suppose I could take my suit and leave it in the car and then go get it if everyone is swimming, and leave it if they're not?  That could work.. Then I only look a little like a doofus :)  lol.  Aren't birthday parties great?  I think it's a shame that there seems to be a certain age where it's no longer "necessary" to have a party?  Who says?  What's the purpose of a birthday party anyway?  In my mind it's to celebrate another year of a person's life.  Well that isn't just for children!  I love party games and I love people and I like being the center of attention, so it kind of stinks that it's not "cool" to have birthday parties.  Maybe I will just buck that tradition and throw myself one smashing birthday party next year.  I could go all out, have cake, hats, dorky games..the whole nine yards. Hmm.. I'll have to think about that.   Well I'm thunk out for now :)  I need to make some lunch and get ready for that party!  See ya tomorrow, feel free to sound off in the comments!

      My heart goes out to Erin Runnion, mother of Samantha Runnion who was found dead on Tuesday night after being kidnapped on Monday.  I can't imagine the pain she is going through.    So what kind of punishment does Samantha's captor deserve? 20 years, Life in prison, death?  How can you even find a punishment that would actually fit the crime in this case?  Because our government believes in decent treatment of those in prison, tormenting him/her (most likely him) is not an option.  But crimes like this make me feel like justice will never be served.  Who knows what kind of horrors that poor little girl went through before she died.  It's not fair.  And as I cry out to God on behalf of this poor mother who is living my worst nightmare, what kind of comfort can I find?  I know that the man who did this will have to stand before God and account for what he did.   And I know God is just.   But I also think, God loves that man.  Because the Bible says in 2 Peter 3:9  "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness.  He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."   He would like for this man to come to repentance.  I want vegeance, I want death.  I want this man to suffer every horror that could be thought of, because I think he is despicable.  I think he is disgusting.  But God loves him, and not only suffers over the loss of Samantha, but suffers over the sin of this man.  And if that man decides to call out to God, God will save him.  God won't make the consequences of his crime disappear, the man will still have to suffer whatever the consequences may be.  But God will honor his prayer and make him a child of God.  Part of me wants to cry out as to how that could be.  This disgusting, less than human, evil man--how could God possibly forgive him and allow him into His presence?   Because God has promised in Joel 2:32  "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."   Everyone--murderer, adulterer, liar, thief, those who think they are better than others, rich, poor, educated, uneducated--everyone.  And if God could not forgive this man who has done this horrible thing, what hope do we have?    We need to pray hard that this man is found, because he is a threat to other children and other people. But we also need to pray that God will intervene in his life and bring about repentance.  That will be difficult.  But we should.  As Christians, we need to know God's heart and what He wants to see done.  And according to 2 Peter--he wants everyone to come to repentance and that none should perish and that should be our heart too.  Granted we are going to have to ask God to help us desire those things.  Because it will not come naturally.    But if we truly want to be God's followers, we have to make the things He desires, the same things we desire.  It takes a relationship with God to really know what He desires.  It will take time.  It will take patience and it will take a lot of discipline as He begins to transform us.  It will probably be painful as well as we see ourselves for who we really are.  We like to think of ourselves as "do-gooders", but in reality we're really selfish.  I'm gonna take some time this week to pray for this man and the Runnion family..

      Welcome to my blog.  A place to place your thoughts out loud and hopefully to find a few to mull over.  Hopefully one day my blog will actually appear in the updated list and I will actually use my comments space, but we will have to wait and see I think.

      Howdy Ho!   BOOKS   Started  The Presence  by T. Davis Bunn yesterday.  It's really interesting.  It is not linked to  The Warning  or  The Ultimatum  (also by T. Davis Bunn).  It is based around the character TJ Case who is a lawyer.  He was a Congressman, but crossed party lines to help a friend get into Congress and then ended up losing his seat.  Anyway, I'm only on chapter 4, but it has some really great characters.  One thing I appreciate about the books I have read of Bunn's, is that his characters are struggling to accept who God has called them to be and have to make huge sacrifices for God.  I think it has been helpful as I have thought about my "major decision".  Anyway, very interesting.  I haven't chosen my next non-fiction book yet.  I only have like  12 I would like to read..lol :)  But at the rate I read non-fiction that could take me a year.   THOUGHTS FOR TODAY   My daughter had her first soccer practice last night.  She was too funny.  A total bundle of energy and she would just fly towards the ball but really had no clue what to do with it once she had it.  She couldn't remember who was on her team and kept getting confused as to which way to kick it!  But she had a great time and that's what is important right? :)    As a mom who has never been a part of the soccer sport, I was disappointed by the fact that not one person really helped me out as to what was going on.  I saw a few familiar faces (from around school), but no one came up to help me feel "included".  It was very odd.  I have heard it said that church leagues (of any sport) are the worst to play on.  And I unfortunately am beginning to wonder if it's true.  With softball, everyone was very nice and we would talk as practice was going on and learn little things about each other.  But walking out to the soccer field, it became very obvious that everyone knew everyone else and that I was the outsider.   It was awkward--very awkward.  And frustrating!  Part of me just wanted to say "forget it" and go home.  And probably would have if my daughter hadn't had a great time.  So as I think about that experience it brings to me a sense of urgency to make sure our church doesn't become like that.  That when a new person walks through the door we are friendly and welcoming and willing to "show them the ropes".  And how important that not just one person does that, but several--so the new person really feels like they are being accepted and really wanted there.  Help me God to remember that every Sunday, regardless of what is going on, the most important thing is to make people feel Your love in a tangible way.    Would love to hear about your experiences of being an "outsider" or creative ways you've helped others not feel like an "outsider"!  Feel free to Sound Off!

      Hey, Hey, Hey--look who's back :)  Maybe I'd be better at weekly blogging?  lol.   BOOKS   I FINISHED IT!  :) (  For Better or For Best  that is)  Smalley is big into practical ideas.  Which I appreciate, but at times get frustrated because I can be sort of an anal person and think if I just do this, this and this, this will happen.  Which is hardly EVER true unless you are doing math!  But I probably learned three important lessons (nothing new here--just good reminders)  1. Don't assume you know everything. 2. If you do assume so, be willing to apologize everytime you are proven wrong. 3. And when you actually do know something, don't rub it in.  :)  lol.  Ok, just kidding (sort of).  The main theme throughout the book is the same thing I hear over and over in every book I read about relationships and every person I've ever known who has went to marital counseling gets the same theme as well--"If you want a better marriage, you are going to have to be willing to change."  No matter who you are or what the situation is, you cannot coerce, manipulate, persuade, or bribe your mate into being who you want them to be.  You have to become who God wants you to be and delight in your mate because you love your mate unconditionally, not because you want something.  :)   THOUGHTS FOR TODAY   Have you ever had a decision to make and you just can't seem to decide? I'm not usually that way.  I'm usually very decisive.  But man right now, I'm stuck.  God seems totally silent on the subject and I've polled most of my friends and have gotten very little response because it's one of those big decisions that no one really wants to say their opinion for fear that they might be steering you wrong.  It's one of those major decisions that will affect every little part of your entire life--it's a turn your life upside down kind of decision.  And God seems silent.  I would think He would have a lot to say about this, but He seems to just  be waiting.  And I HATE waiting--lol.  Of course He knows that, and I'm sure He's grinning at me right now.  Patience my child.  In due time my daughter.  Or am I not listening?  What if He's telling me and I'm not listening?  Ugh..I really hate these kinds of things :)  I know I'm learning something through this process.  And I know He has a plan.  I just don't want to miss it, ya know?    Would love to hear about the times God has seemed to be "silent" and how it all turned out!  Sound Off!

      It's me again:)   First things first.  Heylo Brian:)thanks for reading:)  Where to start. We went and looked at the car. The car was in great shape for being 15 years old. It ran good, drove nice, all that usual stuff you look for in a car. While talking to the lady who was selling it we found out that she was selling it becuase her husband in filing for divorce AGAIN. Made me kinda feel bad for thinking of offering her less than what she wanted. No incase your wondering we didn't buy it. yet:)  Still trying to figure why I have my job :) There have been several conversations arise that have been about church/religion kinda conversations ,if ya know what I mean. I have tried to voice my opinion without offense or "sterotypical" retort to somthing or anyone.   Family time!!!! That's a huge one. The kids have developed an interest in video games. Been attempting  to bond/play at the same time with them.  Well  as you can see it's very late ( I think good when the house(people in it) is asleep.) For some strange reason I have a craving for some Cap't N crunch ( which we don't have in the house) of course So I reckon I'll just go to bed.   Got a big day ahead later on so .......  Catch Ya later  Josh   p.s.  Goodnight Brian

      Just wanted to let you know that I made it through today with flying colors!  :)  Ha ha.  And my daughter had a great time as well :)  I dropped her off at her room and said hello to her teacher.  Then her teacher told her to go to the playground until the bell rang and that was that.  I was smiled at politely and got the hint that this was my cue to exit.  So I went to the van and reminded myself how much my daughter loves school and what a great day today was for her.  I managed to choke back the burning sensation in my throat and nose and the tears that pooled in my eyes remained there. :)  When I went back to pick her up she ecstatically told me all about her morning and who was in her class and the rules and that their class got 1 point today (which is a good thing)!  (when they get 15 they get 5 extra minutes of recess!!)  And she gloated over the fact that   I   had homework!  She just thought that was hilarious.  (just some papers to sign and a handbook to look over--typical first day materials).  Anyway, the morning went well and my daughter is anxiously awaiting tomorrow when she'll actually get to "learn stuff" as she puts it. :)  Thank you God for her..and thanks for watching out for her.

      HEY!  It's me!  Wow, remember me?  lol.  I know, I'm terrible at this everyday blogging stuff.  I always wanted to have a diary growing up and my mom would buy me one and I would write in it for like 5 days straight and then I wouldn't write in it again for like another 4 months or so.  I just have never been able to keep up with stuff like that.  ANYWAY--   BOOKS   Yes, I'm STILL reading  For Better or For Best .  As I read it I keep thinking that all his ideas seem manipulative.  Like if I implemented them I would be trying to be someone I'm not.  I'm one of those spontaneous people ya know..I tend to say or feel or think the first thing that comes to me and unfortunately it usually falls out of my mouth as well.  I am much better at tempering that now as I have seen how destructive it can be to relationships.  But it's still always there right beneath the surface, threatening to take over if I let my guard down.  I think the book is good--I do, I think I'm just negative about it because it seems overwhelming :)    I read   The Ultimatum   by T. Davis Bunn a week or so ago.  It was the sequel to   The Warning  .  I liked this one better I think.  Maybe it was just because I understood what was going on better or something.    The Warning  dealt alot with economics and the stock market and bank stuff and I just didn't know what they were talking about most the time so it was confusing.    The Ultimatum   deals more with the characters and relationships and I could identify better with it.  So it was pretty good.    I'm getting ready to start   The Presence  by T. Davis Bunn.  I'm not sure if it goes along with the other two or not.  The cover and stuff is similar in fonts and coloring, but it doesn't say anything like it's supposed to be book 3 or anything.  And the back reads as if it is a completely different story.  So I don't know--stay tuned and I'll figure it out :)    THOUGHTS FOR TODAY   I never did get my watermelon seed question answered.  I haven't had time to get online and research that.  Hopefully within the next couple weeks I'll have some time to get that done.  Life has been so crazy lately.  My daughter's first day of first grade is tomorrow!  So we've been busy getting the school supplies and getting things ready and spending time together before she goes back again.  I absolutely can't stand her going to school..lol.  I know that sounds crazy but it's true.  She is ecstatic.  Always has been about school.  Even before she was going to preschool she would talk about "when" she gets to go to school etc.  And I'm really grateful and glad she enjoys it.  But it's really difficult for me to turn her over to people I don't know very well and for her to spend more time a week with them than with me.  It's scary and heartbreaking.  I can't imagine what I'll be like when she goes off to college or gets married or decides she wants to live in some big city 2000 miles from me.  lol.  But at the same time I'm so proud of her.  She's so confident and carefree and excited and eager.  It's great.   She's a great kid.  I guess this is where trusting God comes in huh? :)  I'll make it.  Well, I guess thats it for right now.  Feel free to share your thoughts with us!

      Ok I'm back and hopefully all will go well, no strike that--all WILL go well :)  Anyway, forgive me for being gone so long.  Life got crazy (as it tends to do from time to time) and I just got sidetracked.  Like one of my best friends, Brian (see What It's All About link), I am not a disciplined person.  While I would like to be, I suffer from procrastination which delays every good intention that I have :)  ANYWAY---   BOOKS   Ok so I still haven't finished   For Better or For Best  by Gary Smalley.  But I AM still reading it.  (that counts right?)  It does have a lot of good information, but to be quite honest, the more I read it, the more I realize I know less and less about being married and I have to come face to face with how selfish I truly am and well, that's depressing.   In Chapter 6 (entitled Motivating Your Husband to Change) Smalley discussed six qualities every woman needs to develop to be able to encourage her husband to listen to her needs and to gain a desire to meet those needs.  The qualities are as follows:   1.  Courage:  The inner commitment to pursue a worthwhile goal without giving up hope. 2.  Persistence:  Continuing to pursue a goal until it is achieved. 3.  Gratefulness:  A sincere appreciation for the benefits received from others. 4.  Calmness:  An inner peace that allows you to respond quietly to a stressful situation without fear. 5.  Gentleness:  Showing tender consideration for the feelings of another. 6.  Genuine Love:  Meeting the needs of another, prior to your own personal needs being met.   Ok, so as I look over this list, I have to cringe.  Out of this list of six, I would say persistence is the only quality I see in my character that manifests itself on a consistent basis.  All the others I have seen at times, but are in no way a daily way of life.  But the more I read the more I keep saying to God, "I can't do this."  As I read the steps he outlines to help bring "marital bliss", I say "that's just not me."  Then I get even more bummed.  But then I began to realize, these qualities etc that he talks about, are very similar (if not exactly the same) to the fruits of the Spirit found in Galatians 5:22 & 23 (let me refresh your memory--and mine!)   "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control."   And so as this thought passes through my mind, I'm encouraged because just as I cannot conjure up the fruits of the Spirit, I don't believe I can conjure up the six qualities stated above.  It's from God.  It's not about me.  It's about loving God and allowing God to work in me and His Spirit produces the love, joy, etc.  And His spirit will also produce in me the courage and persistence and all the other qualities--if I yield to Him.      I think we try to make things so complicated by figuring out the latest communication techniques to improve our relationships or trying to decide what kind of punishments we should provide when our children disobey or what to do when things go wrong, when really it all comes down to giving our lives to God and following Him daily.  He will give us the strength to make it through each thing that comes our way--if only we turn to Him.  I know in my own life there have been many times when instead of immediately turning to Him, I turn to a friend or relative, or book, or magazine to figure out how to deal with what's going on.  Don't get me wrong, these things can be a help, they can give you some really practical advice.  But the bottom line is that it all comes back to your relationship with God and if you're allowing Him to produce His fruits through your life or if you are trying to do it on your own. :)  Ok, so back to the books I'm reading.   The Warning  by T. Davis Bunn was pretty good.  Not a great read, but interesting.  It's about a man who is called by God to warn God's people that an economic disaster is coming. It is a part of a series, but I'm not sure what the other books are, I'll let you know. :)    THOUGHTS FOR TODAY   I guess I really already did that earlier. :)   Thanks for reading..please feel free to sound off!

      Hey! :)    BOOKS    I read  The Healer  by Dee Henderson this week.  It's a continuation of the O'Malley Series.  Great set of books!  The premise of the series is that there are 7 orphans who wind up a Trevor House and they adopt each other as family and when they grew up they legally changed their last names to O'Malley.  Each book focuses in on one of the children (now who are all adults) and takes us on their journey of finding Christ and whatever else happens to be going on in their lives.  They have all been excellent romantic/mystery novels.  And they are very light reads.   Experiencing God   is going really well.  We started Unit 4 this week.  I'm enjoying the daily discipline and also the new desire within me to make this a part of my life.  Today we talked about God and all the different names there are for Him.  We took time to worship Him and call Him by those names..it was good :)   WHAT'S GOING ON?   Not much.  Keeping busy basically.  We have developed a routine that works, but is tiring :)  With all the kids going to school it makes it interesting in keeping up with who needs to bring what on what day and when. :)  But we're figuring it out.   My major decision has yet to be decided.  I'm not sure what God's waiting on, but I'm learning to follow His lead.  So I'm waiting and trying not to worry or figure it out :)    THOUGHT FOR TODAY    Take time to pray for your friends.  And take time to give them a call and see how they are doing..just because you want to :)  Don't forget to sound off!

      I'm BACK:)   BOOKS    The Presence  ended up being really good.  It was very encouraging along the lines of learning to trust when God is speaking to you.  The main character has a tremendous amount of faith and trust in God.  Good book :)    Experiencing God  is going really well..am thoroughly enjoying.  It does require quite a bit of time each day and so that seems to be taking up what little free time I have had for things like reading, getting online, or just watching tv.  Which isn't a bad thing :)  There are so many things through this book that are not new, but are said in a way that it makes sense.  The theme over and over is that there is no method or formula to make you a good Christian--it's all about a relationship with God.  And the point is not to become a "good" person or Christian, but to enter into a relationship with God. To learn how to love Him.  And then ultimately to learn how to see where He is at work around you and adjust your life to become part of it.  That is so different then asking God to bless our plans or to "help" us out.  It's not about us, and while we agree with that statement, how often do we go ahead and continue to make it about us?  What is God doing in  MY  life?  What does He want  ME  to do?  We get so busy doing and pleasing God (which is important) that we forget about the relationship.  There is a statement in the book that says,  "You cannot bypass the relationship."    I'm so guilty of doing that.  I like to be busy, I like to do all kinds of things and I think that I'm doing them because I love God and I want to serve Him.  But I think that if I was really honest with myself, I do them because I want to be a good person and a great Christian and I want to feel good about myself.  It's not because I love God.    There was another place in the book where a church member was asked by the pastor,  "Can you describe your relationship with God by sincerely saying, 'I love You with all of my heart?'"  The strangest look came over his face.  He said "Nobody has ever asked me that.  No, I could not describe my relationship with God that way.  I could say I obey Him, I serve Him, I worship Him, and I fear Him.  But I cannot say that I love Him."   That hit me upside the head yesterday because I realized that if I was truly honest, I would have to say the same thing.  I would add that I respect, honor, and appreciate God.  But love, I'm not so sure.  To be really honest..I don't think that I know Him well enough to honestly say that.  I kind of liken it unto great speakers and/or authors I have heard or read.  I know a lot about them, I've seen how they develop their speeches or their stories, I'm "wowed" by them, but I haven't entered a personal relationship with them.  And sometimes I wonder about my relationship with God. I say I love God, but do I spend time with him?  I know I judge how a person feels about me by the amount of time they spend with me.  Especially in my marriage.  If Josh spent as much time with me as I do with God, our marriage would be in BIG trouble.  And I think before I always thought of spending time with God as one of the things you do to make you a good Christian.  And while I know I knew in the back of my head that really it's to develop a relationship with  God, I didn't live that way.  So this study has been really good for me to really fall in love with God.  Not just to serve, worship, obey, fear, respect, and appreciate--but to LOVE GOD!  It's been awesome and I find myself looking forward to the time I get to spend in the study and the time I spend afterwards just "being" with God.   THOUGHT FOR TODAY   Do you love God?  OR do you just obey and serve Him etc.?  Take some time to fall in love with God again, or for the first time!  Don't forget to Sound off and tell me about it!

      Hey!  How's it goin?? :)   BOOKS    The Presence  is going well.  I'm about half-way through it.  It's interesting.  Not the best book I've read, but still good :)  I have started my next non-fiction and that's  Experiencing God .  I've went part way through this workbook before, but petered out somewhere in the middle because my procrastination/lack of discipline kicked in and I just got out of it.  This time I'm leading a small group, so that will help tremendously in keeping me on track :)  It's great stuff, well worth the time and it's really awesome and I'm looking forward to making it all the way through.  Hopefully I will also become more faithful with blogging and can share my thoughts with you on it :)   WHAT'S GOIN' ON?   New section :)  Just some tidbits of what's going on in my life :)  My oldest son who is soon to be 5 started preschool today!  He went last year as well, but this is his first day this year :)  Tomorrow my youngest son will start preschool for the very first time!  They are both so excited about it and that's just terrific, so glad for them!  Soccer practice went better this week :)  While people weren't overly friendly, they didn't try to avoid me either :)  lol.  And my daughter is improving!  Which is great ;)  She's having a great time and it's good to see her out there.  I'm trying (desperately) to get into some kind of routine.  It's so not working, but I so need it or else I"m going to go crazy!  My poor son (the youngest who is 3) ended up putting himself to bed tonite!  It was so funny, I was helping my daughter with her homework, and my oldest son was watching and talking with us and Josh came home from helping out my brother and when we all went upstairs to read our bedtime story, there was my youngest already curled up in bed fast asleep!  When I had hollered upstairs about 15 minutes before that he had said he was playing, so I didn't think anything about it!  Poor Kid, he's just exhausted with all the running around we seem to be doing!!   THOUGHTS FOR TODAY   I think I'll leave you with some thoughts from my  Experiencing God  book--2 things stuck out at me tonite.  1. Our memory verse--John 15:5  "I am the vine; you are the branches.  If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing."   Apart from HIM we can do nothing--absolutely nothing.  Nothing new, but just struck me hard.  2. (quoting from the book) "When you come to the Lord Jesus to seek His will for your life, which of the following requests is most like what you ask?  Check your response.      1.  Lord, what do you want me to do?  When do you want me to do it?  How shall I do it?  Where shall I do it?  Who do you want me to involve along the way?  And please tell me what the outcome will be.      2. Lord, just tell me what to do one step at a time, and I will do it."  OK, so I obviously chose number 2 because I'm so together--_NOT!! :)  I chose one, and would probably add-_How long do you want me to do it? and How can I know for sure it's you?  lol.  I'm horrible about that!  I don't want to just make this first little step and then wait--waiting is horrible..I HATE waiting :)  lol.  But it's such a necessary part.  Anyway, it's getting late and I better go.  Let me know your thoughts!

      Am enjoying   Experiencing God   immensely!    So much good stuff and it's very challenging.  It's discussing crisis of belief right now, which is the point in time where you realize what God is asking you to do and you know you cannot do it on your own, that you will have to trust Him to do it.  So you have to decide what you believe about God.  Do you believe what you say you believe and are you going to make that belief reality by actually acting on it?  Good stuff.  I really appreciated today's lesson...here's an excerpt:        "What our world often is seeing in our day is a devoted, committed Christian serving God.  But, they are not seeing God.  They comment on what we are doing,            'Well, there's a wonderful, dedicated, committed group of people serving God.'  They, however, do not see anything happening that can only be explained in            terms of the activity of God.  Why?  Because we are not attempting anything that only God can do.            Our world is not attracted to the Christ we serve, because they cannot see Him at work.  They see us doing good things for God and say, 'That is wonderful, but           that's not my thing.'  The world is passing us by,  because they do not want to get involved in what they see.  They are not having an opportunity to see God.             Let the world see God at work and He will attract people to Himself.  Let Christ be lifted up--not in words, but in life.  Let them see the difference that a living           Christ makes in a life, a family, or a church; that will make a difference in how they respond.  When the world sees things happening through God's people that           cannot be explained except that God Himself has done them, then the world will be drawn to the God they see."    Great stuff.  How often we do that..our little "do-gooder" works.  Not that doing good is wrong, but we need to be sure that we are spending our time doing the things God calls us to do.  Watching and seeing where God is at work and then joining Him in that task, not dreaming up things to do for God and asking Him to bless it.  I think sometimes we fail to truly believe (by acting on our belief) that God is involved in this world.  I think sometimes we think He's up there hanging out, waiting for someone to get a creative idea so that He can bless it.  God is already at work.  He's already moving.  He's calling us to join Him in His work that He is doing.  He's the boss.

       BOOKS   Finished Experiencing God.  Was great.  Definitely a much needed spiritual awakening.  It really got me thinking and diving into God's Word and listening to God and watching.  Highly recommend it, especially if your walk feels stale and cold.  Was great.  Finished the first book of Harry Potter.  It was cute.  The only problem I had was it had one cuss word (d---) in the beginning and that just frustrated me.  But beyond that, a thoroughly enjoyable book.  I have begun the second in the series and am liking it as well!   Luke   I was nervous when I finished Experiencing God because I had this great routine of spending time with God and now I'm on my own again.  So I've started reading Luke.  I don't think I've ever read this book in its entirety.  So I'm looking forward to discovering it in the next few weeks.  I read Chapter 1 on Wednesday and today I read chapter 2   Chapter 1   The one thing that stood out to me was how much I appreciate Mary for living a pure life.  I had never really thought about it.  But to be chosen to carry Christ!  How humbling and nerve-wracking.  Can you imagine?  I appreciate that there was a woman with who God could entrust the Christ.    Chapter 2    In this Chapter I appreciate how God gave Mary and Joseph confirmation (as He did in Chapter 1 with Elizabeth) that the child they were to raise was indeed the Christ.  We have two separate people who come up to them and declare Jesus as God's salvation.  I can't imagine being Mary & Joseph..the questions they must have asked themselves.  The doubts that Joseph had to have struggled with in believing Mary that she hadn't been with someone else.  It is mind boggling.  But we see here God anticipating those doubts and struggles and giving them confirmation through other believers.  How true that is for today as well!  God, you're too cool!

      Life is so crazy around here!  I feel like someone pushed the fast forward button on my life.  It's the middle of November..Holy Cow!  I can't believe how fast this year has flown by.  Now we're in the middle of Thanksgiving plans and then soon to be Christmas and then the New Year and if that wasn't enough to make me crazy, my brother-in-law is getting married in 2 weeks and both my husband and daughter are in the wedding!  Aaaaaaa!  :)  I do love to be busy though.  It cracks me up because here I am complaining about how busy I am, but the moment this all slows down (about the end of January) I will be complaining about how bored I am..lol.  Never satisfied are we?

      This week has been less than the best.    Wednesday night was the best--NOT :)  A guy who goes to our church is in serious physical pain with no end in sight.  As I talked to him for over an hour I was so overwhelmed with all that he was going through.  I'm a "fix-it" person.  If there's a problem, I'll work on it and think on it and figure out a solution.  That's the kind of person I am.  But there is no "fixing" his situation.  I couldn't "do" anything.  And it broke my heart.  Right after I got off the phone with him, I  got a call from my brother.  His life has been turned upside down and he was now in the hospital suffering from a nervous breakdown.  And again there was nothing I could "do".  Nothing I could do to "fix" or even temporarily put a band-aid on the situation.  And my heart was broken once more.  After I got off the phone, I did a lot of crying.  Not for me, but for them.  For the guy who deals with physical pain everyday and it's messing up his life in more ways than you could imagine.  For my brother who feels like he's lost everything.  I cried for them.  I cried that their lives are so messed up.  And then I spent some time with God.  And I laid it out before Him.  It was good.  He doesn't want me to "fix" everything.  He doesn't want me to "figure" it out.  He wants me to love on people.   If one part of the body suffers, all the other parts suffer with it..." 1 Corinthians 12:26   It's been a long time since I've allowed myself to "suffer" with another.  Most of the time I take it before God and trust Him with it and go about my merry way. Oh and don't forget that I would give a band-aid or two for the situation.  God calls us to suffer with each other.    Thanks God that you humbled me this week and made me think about someone else and not just to think, but to feel their pain.  Thanks for making it real to me.  Be the body.  Suffer with those who are suffering.   And there is an upside as well...   ...Or if one part of our body is honored, all other parts share its honor.  1 Corinthians 12:26 Rejoice with those who are rejoicing!  Tonight I will do that too.  I'm going with a bunch of ladies from The Crossover to TGI Friday's to eat and talk and have a great time.  And I'm sure there will be lots of laughter!  So really, this week has been a good week.  I was allowed to come alongside of other parts of "the body" and suffer and I'm also getting the opportunity to rejoice as well.    God is good.

        Experiencing God     Just like individuals, churches are often more interested in what God wants them to do than what He wants them to be.  Being the kind of people that please God is far more important than doing something for Him.    Ahh, being.  That sense of just "being" there.  Not doing anything.  Drives us crazy.  Can't imagine the thought of not being busy doing something.    God desires purity and holiness in our lives.  He's more interested in who we are than what we do.  He wants character development..we want to be able to "list" all the great causes we've championed.  I think some of us will be surprised when we stand before Him on judgment day and find that our list is insufficient.  Develop who you ARE in Christ.  The actions will follow out of that being..and the best part is, those actions won't be filled with our selfish desires and motivations, they will be filled with God's power and His authority and will actually make a difference.

      Two days in a row..whoo hoo!  Just finished my lesson today and there was such a great illustration, that I just had to share it!  The question,   How can I know whether the word I receive is from God, my selfish desires, or Satan?    was posed to Blackaby and the following was an illustration he used to help bring understanding.  From Experiencing God (workbook) page 160    Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Mounties, train men in anti-counterfeiting work.  They never let a trainee see a counterfeit bill.  They know only one genuine type of ten-dollar bill exists.  They so thoroughly study the genuine bill that anything that does not measure up to that is counterfeit!  You can't imagine all the ways people can counterfeit money.  But Mounties don't study how people counterfeit money.  They just study the real thing.  Anything that doesn't measure up to that is fake!   I just loved that.  Applying that to our spiritual lives...  Know God thoroughly and when something comes your way and you have to question it..measure it against God.  If it doesn't measure up..it's not from Him.  Thanks God!

      Added an interesting blog tonight.  It's a group of people ( I assume scientists?) who are in Antarctica.  Some really awesome pics.  I haven't got a chance to read all the way through the blog yet, so not certain about all of the content.  Interesting though.. :)

      I thought I would get better at this with time, but I don't know :)  lol.  Just wanted to share a couple of Scriptures with you that God has laid on my heart lately...     I am the vine; you are the branches.  If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.  John 15:5  He who belongs to God hears what God says.  The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God. John 8:47  No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him... John 6:44    (all NIV translations)  I just found each of them to be right in my face lately :)  Apart from God I am nothing!  If I'm not hearing God it is because I do not belong to God!  Only the Father can draw people to Himself!  It's not about me!  Duh! :)  Thanks for listening!

        Luke 5    I love how when Jesus called people, they  "left everything and followed him" .  Oh, that we might be willing to do the same.  Here we see Simon (also known as Peter) leave everything.  And we also know from Chapter 4 that Simon was married (see Luke 4:38).  So it wasn't like some bachelor guy who could easily drop everything.  Can you imagine Simon as he walked into the house that night?  We don't always see the inside scoop, but I suppose we can use our imagination.  Maybe his wife was very willing, but what if she wasn't?  Talk about stress.  Gotta love v. 16  "But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed" .  Jesus knew that time with the Father was very important.  If Christ needed that time, how much more do we?  I hadn't noticed before that v. 27-32 talks about the calling of Levi, and elsewhere it is the calling of Matthew..just interesting side note there.  The last section (v.33-39) of this chapter took me a bit to really figure out.  But it finally made sense.  Jesus was bringing the new "wineskin" and you can't just weave the old and new together.  You have to embrace the new.  I liked that. How often God has done that with me.  I want to hold on to the things in the past and He has given me a new future.  If I want to fully enjoy and live my future, I cannot hold on to my past, no matter how comfortable it may be.  Cool :)

        Luke 4    The temptation of Christ.  For a long time I would read over this passage and kind of say to myself "that's nice".  I had yet to comprehend (even a little bit) what it meant for Christ to be fully God and fully man.  I would always say to myself...He was God..like that would be hard.  But as I have begun to understand Christ as fully God and fully man I see the importance and the difficulty of these temptations.    Food   I don't know about you, but I can barely go four hours without a snack, let alone FORTY DAYS with no food! :)  Seriously though.  When I'm hungry, I'm grumpy, and if someone is shoving a hamburger in my face, it's gonna take more than my puny willpower to say no.  Jesus was hungry.  And He was human.    And by the grace of God He was able to say no.    Power/Success/Stability    I think we look at the second temptation and say "yeah whatever".  But let's stop for a minute and think about our lives.  Satan is offering Jesus everything...all the power and all the success and all the money..  How does this correlate in our own lives?  How often do we sacrifice our time, our energy, our families, to gain power in our company (looking for that next promotion), to be viewed as successful (the nicest car, the nicest house, the nicest clothes), to have a "stable" lifestyle and not have to "worry" about tomorrow.  But I believe God   has said, not to worry about what you'll wear or what you'll eat because He will take care of those needs.  We don't even have to worry about tomorrow because God will take care of that too.  We struggle with Satan dangling the power and success in front of our faces.     Prove Your Faith    Satan's last temptation (at least that we read about here) is for Jesus to prove that God does what He says He will do.  Ouch.  How often are we faced with questions from people who want proof that our God is real.  Well "why doesn't he heal sickness?" or "why does he let innocent people suffer?"  Questions that we can't answer, questions that seem to fly in the face of what God is about, questions that require faith and knowing God is in control and He has His reasons and whatever those reasons are they are right, true, and fair, because that is who He is.  But it's difficult.  We want God to prove it too.  We want to see with our eyes and know His power.  The other thing that stuck out to me as I read this chapter, was that Christ countered each temptation with God's Word.  With what has been said and promised already.  It just brings home the fact that we need to  know  God's Word in an intimate way.  It was exciting as I did Experiencing God, we had memory verses for each week, and I was amazed at how often the memory verse would apply to something that happened or be fitting in a conversation or was just brought to my mind in various situations.  His Word is alive and very applicable to our lives.    BOOKS    I finished the second Harry Potter book.  It was good.  The books are a bit dark.  Some of the scary parts are a bit gruesome and scary.  I'm not sure I would be comfortable letting my grade school child read them.  I'm not sure...  I started the third book the other night and ran into a couple more curse words (d--- again).  Again I was frustrated at the nonsense of it.  Not necessary, not appropriate.  Frustrating.

        Luke 3   John is reprimanding the crowds who come to be baptized because they basically were wanting to avoid punishment from God so they thought getting baptized would be a good idea.  They weren't ready to change their lives. I really liked verses 10-14...    The people asked John, "Then what should we do?"  John answered, "If you have two shirts, share with the person who does not have one.  If you have food, share that also."  Even tax collectors came to John to be baptized.  They said to him, "Teacher, what should we do?" John said to them, "Don't take more taxes from people than you have been ordered to take."  The soldiers asked John, "What about us? What should we do?"  John said to them, "Don't force people to give you money, and don't lie about them.  Be satisfied with the pay you get."   Luke 3:10-14 New Century Version  As I read that..I thought "How obvious!"  "Duh!".  But as I thought about it more, I realize how we still struggle with these same issues today.  How many shirts are in my closet?  How often have I gave away my clothes to someone else?  How much food do I have in my fridge, but how often do I share it with others?    These people had allowed their culture to creep in and destroy their sense of right and wrong.    Their values were influenced by what was "ok" in their society.  As disciples of Christ, we have a higher authority that we must listen to and more and more his values and ways are the direct opposite of what our culture and our world feels is ok.  My brother asked if it was ok if he invited a woman to our Christmas Dinner.  She has no family in the area, and won't be leaving to see her family until after the holidays because she's in the middle of a messy divorce.  My mind hesitated and then I said, "Yeah, definitely."  But my first thought, was I don't know this woman, I don't want to spend the day with her...It's Christmas after all!  YEAH SHAWNA>>IT"S CHRISTMAS after all!  We should open our hearts and homes to people..especially those in need.  This woman is down and out and I'm thinking about how it will possibly inconvenience me.  Then I read this Chapter in Luke today and had confirmation once more, that I need to be more giving.  I need to realize that everything I have, everything I am, and everything I do, comes from God and I should be willing to freely share it with anyone and everyone.  It's about life change.  Mine being transformed by God and my willingness to join God as He changes other lives.  God thanks for the reminder, thanks for humbling me once more.

      Do you ever feel like you're being tossed around by everything that is going on around you?  I do, and I notice it more because I seem to have a lot of dreams about tornados while I'm feeling that way.  They range from knowing a tornado is coming and doing everything I can to protect myself and then either the tornado never comes, or it goes around or isn't that bad to not knowing the tornado is coming and being stuck in a horrible place and scared out of my mind and it destroying everything.  Sometimes the presence of God is overwhelming and I know I'm being supernaturally protected.  Other times the tornado just rips through and destroys everything.  I think a tornado to me, is very much like life.  Life comes, and I'm really powerless to change it.  I can protect myself, I can prepare for it, but I can't change it.  I can cry out to God, and sometimes He changes it, or protects me, but other times He allows me to go through it.  It doesn't always make sense, but then I'm not God and I can't see the whole picture like He does.

       Friday Five!     1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not?  NO!  I don't like to shop for basically 2 reasons--1.  I always find something that I really want to buy but don't have the money to get and then walk away frustrated and dissatisfied with our financial situation, which is silly!  God has provided for all of our needs and even has seen fit to give us a bit extra! And 2.  I get so tired of all the people.  TOO many people in a small space and it's irritating.   2. What was the last thing you purchased? Today I bought Strawberry Twizzlers at Wal-Mart so I could write the check for over to get cash for lunch.   3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why? An actual store.  I prefer to be able to actually touch my product and know what kind of condition it is in BEFORE I buy it.   4. Did you get an allowance as a child? How much was it?  Never.   5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing?  lol..  The dish drainer I bought this week.  I needed a new one because my old plastic one broke and I was using towels.  But I paid $15!!!!!!!!! for the new one I bought and I just think that is way too much, but I needed one and was tired of dealing with the wet towels etc.  Thanks for listening :)  I would love to hear the answers to these questions from you, so feel free to put them on your website and leave me a link OR answer them in my comments!

       Another Beautiful Day!   Two days in a row and maybe even a third of beautiful weather!  Thank you God!  :)  It has been such a boost to my morale!  I love the sun!   Deer Hunting   Josh (my hubby) went deer hunting today with his dad!  I haven't heard anything from them yet.  It was 5 am when he left this morning and it is now almost 2:30pm.  But I think it's good news that I haven't heard from him..lol  Hopefully he'll get himself a nice buck!   Friday Five   Ok, so I stole the idea off of my friend Brian's website (see Interesting Blogs), but I really liked it, so I'm gonna be a copy cat!  1. List five things you'd like to accomplish by the end of the year.             1.  To begin viewing my overeating as a sin (which it is, but instead of viewing it that way, I view it as a bad habit)      2.  To conquer my "laundry hole"..lol.  Maybe not to always have it done up, but not to have mountains of laundry everytime I look in there.        3.  To learn how to love my husband more effectively.      4.  To have fun during the holidays!      5.  To finish reading a series of books I've been working on.  (this one was hard..argh)   2. List five people you've lost contact with that you'd like to hear from again.        1.  Jana Hacker (very good friend in high school, have spoken very little since I've gotten married & she went to college)      2.  Samara Frame (my best friend in junior high and the beginning of high school, she and I lost touch when I moved away my junior year of high school)      3.  Greg Caywood (a good friend in junior high and high school, last I heard he was in Texas in the military)      4.  Delana Parker (good friend in high school, lost touch when we both got married.  Heard her husband was in Iraq)      5.  Amanda Park (good friend from church camp, lost touch with her when I got married..have no idea where she is.  She was in the military at one point??)   3. List five things you'd like to learn how to do.        1.  Hold my tongue.  Not literally, just when I get frustrated or irritated, sometimes I can't bite back the words.      2.  Think positively first.  I always see the negative before I do the positive.  I would really like to cultivate learning to look at the good.      3.  RELAX!  I am a pretty uptight person.  I have learned a lot from my husband in the art of relaxing.  Sure there are problems that need to be worked on, but if right now at this point in time you can't do anything about it.. LET IT GO AND RELAX!      4.  I would like to learn to shoot a gun (I think).  With all this talk of deer hunting, I'm very curious as to what shooting a gun would be like.  My friend Angie talks about how awesome it is, I'm beginning to be curious!      5.  Learn how to lovingly confront.  I'm getting more bold in my confrontations, but they don't seem to be "in a loving way".  (kind of goes along with  >#1)   4. List five things you'd do if you won the lottery (no limit).        1.  Give back to God.      2.  Build a house (pay off the one I have first)      3.  Invest in my husband's dream ( I won't share it because it's his dream and I'll let him vocalize it when he's ready)      4.  Buy my hubby a Harley-Davidson Motorcycle.      5.  (this may seem silly)  Buy a new bed..a queen-sized one that has a canopy and made of mahogany wood!   5. List five things you do that help you relax.        1.  I'm married, you figure this one out :)      2.  Read      3.  Talk with my husband      4.  Play with my kids      5.  Sit quietly (enjoy the silence..doesn't happen very often in my house!)   Gotta run, time to pick up my son from Preschool!

       I Can See Clearly Now, the RAIN is GONE!   Sunshine, mid 60s and gorgeous!  I just spent sometime outside with my youngest son playing and I was actually warm in my sweatshirt!  What a wonderful day!   The Sacred Romance   I'm in small group with a few other people reading our way through The Sacred Romance.  I'm not sure how I would describe the book.  I really appreciate a lot of what the authors are saying.  It's things I have felt, but never voiced.  But at the same time, they get wordy at times and some of their examples are lengthy and difficult to work through (especially when they use poetry..Ugh..not my strong point).  But something that is sticking with me is what I read last night in chapters 9 &10.  They talk about two roads, one road is straight and you can see a place to stop overnight and the other road bends quickly and you can't make out what's beyond and there are some ominous looking clouds.  Of course the majority of us take the straight road.  Relying on what we can grasp and understand and leave the other road, but we never truly "know" God.  We can only "know" God when we venture into the "unknown".  Ouch.  How much of my life right now is "unknown"?  Virtually none.  And right now my heart is screaming "Isn't there something more?".  I love my life, don't get me wrong.  I have a wonderful husband, great kids and things are going really well actually.    But I know there is something more...with God.  Something more He wants me to do than simply teach Kid's Church, take care of administrative tasks for the church, lead a small group, and all the other "busywork" that I have found for myself to feel fulfilled.  And ya know, I'm still not fulfilled.  I think it's time for me to start asking God what more He has, and more importantly be ready to obey when He tells me.

       I'm Back!   Well I've been reading a lot of blogs lately on a semi-regular basis, so it's kind of gotten me anxious to have a spot to kind of "think" out loud.  So here I am :)   PDA   Public Display of Affection, for those of you who have never had the privilege of having someone shout those three little letters at you.  As for me, if I had a penny (just a penny) for everytime PDA (or some form like: "Get a room" "Enough of that" etc) was said to me I would be an extremely rich woman!  Now I have to admit that when I was in high school then it was very proper to point out the fact that I needn't be kissing on my boyfriend etc.  But now that I've married my sweetheart, one question has to be asked.."WHY are people still yelling PDA?"  "WHEN is it ok to kiss your honey is public?"  Good gravy people!    I love my husband more than words can describe and I thoroughly enjoy giving him a hug or kiss (and even sometimes a pinch on the hiny if no one is looking) in public and I think it's healthy.  It's healthy for young people to see that we really do care for one another and kissing is still fun and very much a part of life after you say "I DO".  Now I'm not saying hanging all over one another and being liplocked 24/7 while you're out in front of everyone.  I'm talking about those stolen moments where you walk past each other and can't resist touching shoulders or hands.  Or the quick kiss on the cheek as you get up to go to the bathroom or something.  Why not?  Why not??    Josh and I have decided that people just say those things because they are jealous.  My hope is that Josh and I will be 80 years old and he'll still be chasing me around the kitchen stealing kisses while I'm trying to make dinner.  I pray that we will still hold hands and not be able to pass each other without touching.

       Christmas!   Oh my goodness, yesterday was a LONG day!  Josh took the day off work and we went Christmas Shopping!  My mom came down to watch the kids and we left at about 12:30pm and didn't get home until 11 pm!  We were all over Terre Haute and even made a trip all the way back to Charleston to pick up a few things we couldn't find.  For the most part, we are done.  Now we have to buy a few stocking stuffers and take the kids to buy presents for each other and their grandparents and then of course Josh and I have to buy for each other.  So I guess we're really not done, even for the most part!  Oh well, think positive right?  All in all the day was really good.  It was fun spending time with Josh and the crowds weren't too bad, except at Super Wal-Mart in Terre Haute..oh man.

       Friday Five    1. Do you enjoy the cold weather and snow for the holidays?  Yes!  I love the snow and cold and how white everything looks.  It's so pretty!    2. What is your ideal holiday celebration? How, where, with whom would you celebrate to make things perfect?  My ideal holiday celebration would be to have all of my family (including my two oldest siblings and their children etc) and all of my husband's family at my home for a big dinner and have a long afternoon of sharing gifts and laughing and making memories.  (believe it or not)   3. Do you do have any holiday traditions?  Yes.  We always go get the Christmas tree together (my mom & my brother's family and us).  I always make fudge for the first time of the season on the day we get the tree.  We always have Christmas lunch at my house.  And I think that's about it.   4. Do you do anything to help the needy?  Yes.  We have done a few different things in the past.  I'm not sure what we're going to do this year.  We have talked about as the kids get older of possibly letting them pick a name from the "Angel Tree" and letting them pick out the gift, wrap it etc.   5. What one gift would you like for yourself?  I would love for my husband to be ready to have another child.  But if you're talking about "material gifts", I would like a new DVD player, the one we have is not working properly.

       Emotions   What is up with me?  I am a pretty sensitive person anyway, I tend to cry at dramatic movies and will frequently cry through a novel.  But these last two days have been so weird!!!!!!!!!!    I first noticed it last night after I read that Nana Upstairs, Nana Downstairs book.  Then this morning I was going through more of the books and ended up finding my 2nd grade yearbook (totally weird, this is also the year my dad died) and got teary eyed looking at that (and for what reason I couldn't tell you!).  Then I'm watching "Little Bill" with my preschooler this morning and it's about his grandma who gets stuck in Cincinatti on Christmas Eve and can't make it to their house and I find myself crying alongside Little Bill because he wants her to be there and she can't and it's not Christmas without her!  I'm hoping this will end soon, because I don't particularly enjoy crying at the drop of a hat.  A doctor would probably tell me that it has nothing to do with anything that is happening around me, but probably an indication of something greater going on inside of me that I'm repressing.  He's probably right.  But do I want to go there?  Not now.

       Childhood Memories   I was going through a tub of books my mother-in-law had given to my three kids and was so surprised when I found a book that I had read and reread and loved as a child!  It's called "Nana Upstairs, Nana Downstairs".  I haven't read this book since I was probably a very young child, at least 8 or 9.  But I readily recognized the cover and amazingly as I began reading it to my kids I could vividly remember the pictures and what ones would come next.  And then I remembered how the story ended and before I knew it my eyes were full of tears and I was fighting hard to control the emotion.  You see, this book is about a little boy who has a grandmother and a great grandmother and every Sunday he would visit them.  He would call his grandmother Nana Downstairs and his great grandma Nana Upstairs because she was very old and couldn't get out of bed.  Well during the story Nana Upstairs dies and the little boy is very upset.  And there is a picture of the little boy going to his mom in the middle of the night and her reaching out to him.  I'm not for sure, but I think I got this book a little before or maybe after my dad's death and maybe that was my fascination with the book..identifying with the young boy's grief.  It is definitely not a happy story, but it has stuck in my heart all these years.  It's interesting how it has resurfaced in my life.  Just wondering where God is going from here...

       Friday Five!   (Well at least doing this has made me blog on a weekly basis!)  The person who comes up with the questions didn't have time for new questions for this week and so I went back and picked a set of questions at random to answer :)   1. Would you consider yourself an organized person? Why or why not?  Yes I'm organized.  Not extremely, but I'm definitely organized more than most people.   2. Do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?  Yes I do.  I have a calendar on my computer that I update almost daily and I also have a calendar in my notebook for work that I keep updated.  I would forget everything if I didn't have these two things.  And I constantly make "to do" lists for home and work.   3. Would you say that your desk is organized right now?  Organized--yes.  Here is the stack for bills, here is the stack of things that need to be put away and here is a stack of things that haven't been gone through and here's a stack for my hubby to go through..etc you get the picture.  (I may be organized, but I'm not very neat)   4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?  My CDs are not alphabetized, but probably because they are just stacked on a shelf that is hard to see.  My movies are all alphabetized. (which is no easy task when you have 3 kids under the age of 7 who really don't care that Care Bears starts with C and needs to go on the top shelf..lol)   5. What's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?  Girl Scouts!  I don't know why, but I'm having a hard time getting it together.  I think it's because it's new and I really am lacking time lately to get it done.

       Friday Five!   It's that time again... :)   You have just won one million dollars:    1. Who do you call first?  It depends.  If it happens during the day and Josh is at work, then I call him.  If he's here with me...I'm not sure.   2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself?  I actually think this is a hard question.  What I would really want is to pay off my home and then sell it and build a new house and decorate it how I would like.  But that's not just for me.  My other big wish list item right now is a new bed..but that's not just for me either :)  So probably new clothes?   3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else?  Supper!  I'd probably take my friends out to celebrate!   4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom?  Yes, first to my church, and then after that I'd have to do a lot of thinking and praying.   5. Do you invest any? If so, how?  Yes.  And I have no idea, I would definitely need to find some people who could help me out!  What about you?  Leave your answers in the comments, or put it on your blog and leave your link!

       Reading & Watching   Of course my two fave things to do are reading and watching movies!  I just finished off the O'Malley Series by Dee Henderson and am getting ready to read, "If I Gained the Whole World" by Linda Nichols.  She also wrote the book "Not a Sparrow Falls", which was probably one of the best fiction novels I've read in a while.   As for movies, the other night Josh & I watched "Johnny English" with Rowan Atkinson (sorry if I messed up the spelling), or you may know him as Mr. Bean.  Well we love Mr. Bean and find him totally hilarious and so we thought we'd watch this movie.  Now it was funny in some parts.  But you can only play the fumbling idiot spy for so long before it gets kind of old, and so this movie was kind of a drag overall.  Oh well!

       Blogger Idol Week 2:  Freedom    urlLink     The darkness was suffocating as I lay in bed, shared with Josh, the only person who mattered in my life.  The weight of my mistakes felt like a physical hold on me.  I tried to stifle my tears as I wept uncontrollably.  How different my life had become.  How far from who I thought I was going to be, had I become.  Josh shifted his weight and snuggled closer.  He did love me.  He did care, but even that wasn't enough to lift the sadness that I felt.  Sensing I was awake, he leaned in for a kiss and felt the dampness on my cheeks.  "What's wrong?" he asked. "Nothing, just a bad dream." I replied.  He pulled me closer. "What kind of dream?" he pried. "The kind best forgotton."  I said and turned to face him, snuggling close for warmth and assurance. "You're unhappy." Josh stated.  With the way he said it, I knew I had to explain.  For he was not the source of my unhappiness and I couldn't bear the thought of him thinking he was. "Yes, I am.  If I died tonight, I know I wouldn't be with God when I woke.  But I don't know where to go from here either."  The emotions began to flow as I once again began to sob uncontrollably. "I always thought that if you would just become more like me, we could be together and we would both be happy.  But now that you have, your joy is gone and I can't stand to see you so unhappy."  He pulled me closer and wept as well.   2 Months Later...   "You're pregnant."  The doctor gave me a half smile, as if he wasn't for sure whether the news would be a happy or sad event.  I managed a lopsided smile back and he continued, "This is a surprise."  He stated it, sensing my fear.  "More like a heart attack."  I laughed as I responded. "Will your parents be a good support system?" he asked, genuninely concerned. "Probably not, but my boyfriend will be." I replied trying to sound more confident than I felt. "There are other options." he said. "No, there aren't.  Not for me." He nodded and said he would get me a referral for a doctor and a prescription for prenatal vitamins until I could schedule an appointment.  I thanked him, took my papers and made my way to the waiting room and paid my bill.  I made it to my car before I completely fell apart.    Pregnant!  I was 18 and pregnant, unmarried.  Oh God!  How could I have gone so far!  Once again I felt so trapped, surrounded by darkness even though it was daylight outside.  I picked Josh up from work and I didn't even have to say anything.  He just reached over and held me for a long time.  When we parted he looked in my eyes and said, "I love you.  We will make this work...together.  Marry me."  I looked at him and wanted so much to say yes and have the "happily ever after", but I couldn't ask that of him.  To give up his life for me and a baby.  Sensing my doubt, he took my hand, "Don't even think of saying no.  I'm not walking away."  It was settled.  I would marry him.  The next few weeks were a blur as we made definitive plans before we told our parents.  We knew that if we already had plans in place, it would help our parents to see us not only as a couple but as logical thinkers.  We found a trailer and decided on a simple ceremony, no big flashy wedding, just a simple dress and him in his suit and tie.  Now all that was left was to tell the family the news.  He dropped me off at home before he drove home for the night.  I hoped it was too late for my mom to be up, but she was in the living room.  "I got this in the mail today."  It was an envelope addressed to me from Department of Family Services, already opened. "You opened my mail?"  I blurted. "You want to explain?"  she asked, hurt evident on her face. "I'm pregnant.  Josh and I are getting married.  We have a trailer in town....I'm sorry." I finished lamely. "When were you going to tell me?"  she shouted.  We were both crying now. "I don't know, things have just happened so fast." "I'm not taking care of that child." "I didn't expect you to." "How could you?" "I'm sorry."  Silence..unending silence it seemed.  Finally mom spoke, softer this time, "You don't have to marry him you know?" "I want to.  He's a good man."  More silence.  Then mom stood up and walked out of the room.  I have never felt so alone.   1 Month Later   Telling his parents didn't go much better.  Again the reassurance that "they" weren't going to raise that child, and how could we have been so stupid.  But wedding plans were made, and as time had passed, both parents wanted the marriage at least to have a proper start with a wedding and had offered to help in various ways.  It would still be small, but at least memorable and the family would attend.  Now it was time to get everything out in the open.  Tomorrow, Josh and I would stand before our church and let them know what was going on.  During the last few months Josh had learned that there was a God who loved him and forgave him and wanted to be the Rock for him to lean on during this time.  Josh had given his life to that Rock.  Hope surged.  It might work. Oh God, please let it work.  I am so sorry.  How many times had I said that?  A gazillion.  Was it enough?  Was the sorry for going against what He wanted enough?  I didn't know.    "God, please, somehow show me it is enough.  I have nothing left to give."  I prayed as I tried to rest.  The baby inside of me moved.  How I had grown to love this little one.  How confusing it was to love something that came about as a mistake.  As sin.   "Oh God, help me to know how to feel."  Sleep came, many hours later.   The Next Morning   The service seemed to last an eternity.  Song after song, words and more words.  I couldn't concentrate on any of them.  Then at last, the last prayer and the pastor moved forward once again.  This was it.  I heard him say something about forgiveness, something about restoring those with a repentant  heart and the next thing I new Josh and I were moving toward the stage.  Somehow, I managed to climb the steps.  Then I heard Josh talking, crying, and talking and then somehow I managed to begin talking and weeping.  Looking into the faces of people who had loved me since I was a child.  And when I looked, they didn't have angry faces, but many were weeping as well.  Finally, Pastor Scott took over and prayed for us and then told the congregation that they could do whatever God had called them to do.  As I stood to the side, trying to control my weeping, I saw a line begin to form heading toward the front.  Toward me and Josh.  Person after person clung to me and looked me in the eye and said "I forgive you."  Then, Donna came to me.  She hugged me close and then looked in my face with tears streaming down her face and she said, "I've always told Miranda to look up to you.  That you were a good model of a girl who's heart was for God."  I dipped my head as I worried as to what would come next.  This was a woman who had taken time out for me, prayed with me.  Someone who I had truly disappointed.  Someone who she had told her daughter to look up to, and I had let her down.  Oh God forgive me!  She struggled with her emotions and finally caught my gaze and said, " And I still will."  The darkness lifted.  And I was standing in the light once again. It was enough.   That was the day I learned what freedom was about.  Freedom from the bondage of sin.  True freedom can only come from God.  When I needed tangible freedom from my sin, God gave it to me in the form of a woman who could have so easily been angry with me, but instead gave me the sweet taste of forgiveness and freedom.  He's still there today offering me freedom in Him.  Freedom from the enslavement of my own desires.  And He does for you too.  This story is based on a true story.  It's my story.  It's been awhile, so exact wording and the timeline might be a bit off, but the heart of the story is true.  My hope by repeating the story is that someone else may find freedom as well.

       Movie Review:  Anger Management   I should preface this by saying I'm not much of an Adam Sandler OR Jack Nicholson fan.  I did enjoy Mr. Deeds & The Wedding Singer of Adam Sandler, so I thought I would give this one a try.  And it was funny.  There were several scenes that I laughed out loud and thought were very clever.   But unfortunately Mr. Sandler took a lot of the jokes too far (as he often does) and instead of being funny, they were crass and disgusting.  There were two things that bothered me a lot.  One was a scene where two girls kiss and  that just grossed me out.  And the other was when Dave (Sandler) talked about molesting a mentally disabled person.  Both were done for laughs, but I didn't laugh at either one.  It kind of made me ill that people thought these things would be funny.  So those things kind of ruined most of the movie for me.  I did like that the movie pointed out that people who don't deal with their anger have just as much of an anger problem as those of us who explode. (I'm an exploder...a closet exploder..just those close to me have seen me explode, and the few people in traffic who have witnessed my angry face and pointing from inside the car..lol)  I thought that the idea of facing the things that have made you what you are today was also a good idea.  Now I don't agree with how the confrontation occurred, but I think it can be very good to go back and tell the person that you are angry with that you are angry and you were hurt.  Most of the time the person probably doesn't care, but at least you get it out there and can go on.  At least in my personal experience it has been the best course of action.  Anyway, back to the movie...Jack Nicholson is just too strange for me.  I'm not sure I can think of any movie that I've seen that I've liked him in.  He plays a better bad guy than a good guy for sure.    Then of course there are the kooky music numbers that have become classic Adam Sandler.  And several cameos that were fun to watch for.  Rob Schneider did not appear though :(  But Mayor Rudy Guilani (sp?) did shout "YOU CAN DO IT!", which was pretty funny.  The guy who played the butler in Mr. Deeds was in this one too as Chuck, Dave's anger ally.  Marisa Tomei, Dave's girlfriend, did a good job..I always like her.  So overall my opinion is to leave it on the shelf because it isn't worth wading through the crap to see the funny stuff.  If you've seen it, I would love to hear your opinion!

       Comments!   It seems that my comments haven't been working properly lately :(  What a bummer.  They are fixed now and I apologize to my faithful reader, Brian, who probably thought he was being ignored while I thought that he found me rather boring and had nothing to say!  lol!  Confusion how entertaining!  I did have one other person leave a comment..Beth Sargent!  I had made a comment on her blog awhile back and she checked me out and asked me a question and since I've never replied back she probably moved on :(  I will email her so I don't seem like a complete snob, just a little ignorant when it comes to the technical aspects!  Thanks for your comments!

       Just For Fun   These are the answers to a test I took that I found on Brian's Blog!  1. The person who you are walking with is the most important person in your life.  You were walking with: Josh  WHOO HOO :)  2. The size of the animal is representative of you perception of the size of your problems.  Animal you saw: deer  That is very interesting..  3. The severity of the interaction you have with the animal is representative of how you deal with your problems (passive/aggressive).  Your interaction: none   lol..if anyone knows me, they know this is NOT true :)  4. The size of your dream house is representative of the size of your ambition to resolve your problems.  Size of your dream house: It's massive..the biggest house I've ever seen.  LOL..too funny :)  5. The absence fence is indicative of an open personality: People are welcome at all times. The presence of a fence indicates a closed personality: You'd prefer people not to drop by unannounced.  You have a fence: no  Very accurate :)  6. If your answer did not include food, people, or flowers, then you are generally unhappy.  In the dining area you saw: It's a dark wood with high back chairs with no cushions. There are candles and a vase of wildflowers for a centerpiece. The room is very lighted. Lots of windows letting in natural light with greenery all around.  FLOWERS!  7. The durability of the material with which the cup is made of is representative of the perceived durability of your relationship with the person named in number 1. For example, Styrofoam, plastic, and paper are all disposable, metal and plastic are durable.  The cup was made of: foam  Come on, how often do you see a metal cup outside?  8. Your disposition of the cup is representative of your attitude towards the person in number 1.  What you did with the cup: pick it up to put in the trash  I don't think so..  9. The size of the body of water is representative of the size of your sexual desire.  Body of water: an ocean  Oh my gosh..face is red!  10. How wet you get in crossing the water is indicative of the relative importance of your sex life.  To cross the water you: I won't  lol..poor Josh :)

       Blogger Idol    urlLink      Well let's see, the first week of Blogger Idol, and the topic is the 80s!  The 80s?  Come on people.  At the end of the 80s I was a whopping 12 years old!  lol  Hmm...  Things I remember from the 80s...  Strawberry Shortcake (she rocked..and she's coming back!) My dad passing away (not a happy memory..but it happened in 84) My first year at Camp Maranatha (85) My first trip to Six Flags (86) Meeting my future husband (at Camp! --85) Rainbow Brite Garbage Pail Kids (who in the world would have ever thought they would have taken off?) Learning to read  Hmm, that's not alot :(  Thanks to the show on VH1 entitled "I Love the 80s" I am able to enjoy a glimpse back in time, but beyond that I'm afraid I have very little to say!  So nothing ingenious for this round, I believe I've got my work cut out for me :)!  I think I'll go take a look at what everyone else had to say!

       Friday Five    1. What does it say in the signature line of your emails?  I don't have a signature that I use everytime, but if it's an email for The Crossover (a formal one anyway) I use:  Keeping you informed, Shawna Ridgley Administrative Assistant for The Crossover 217-932-6291 shawna@thecrossover.org   The sad part?  I had to look it up because I wasn't for sure what it said..lol   2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?   No, I didn't have a senior quote.  But I was voted "Most Dramatic" and "Most Likely to Travel the World"   3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?   JSRJQ 5 is what I would like to have and each letter is the beginning letter to each person in my family!   4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?   I got a bracelet from my mom when I was little and it has my name, Shawna, on it.  I also got a cool pin that has been twisted in to my name in cursive and has my birthstone on it.  It's pretty cool too.   5. What would you like your epitaph to be?   lol..I have no idea, but I would like it to be funny.  I am so not reverent about the dead and I don't know if that's good or bad.  But people are dead, they're gone, if you wanted to say something nice to them, you should have said it while they were alive.  I guess if I used the epitaph as my last words to the world, I might say "May the bird of life that flies over your head always be constipated."  lol..Ok so maybe not, but I don't know what I would put.

       Blogger Idol   I signed up for Blogger Idol, which is kind of a "contest" (I use that word very loosely) for bloggers.  A guy named Darren will put a theme on his blog for all of us to write about on our blogs and we can check out what each other have said and then I think we can also post on whose ideas we liked best or something like that.  Anyway, it's not really a contest so to speak as a chance to share ideas and generate attention to your blog.  My hope is that it will get me to have something interesting to blog about!  lol

       BOOKS!   I have been reading a lot lately.  I finished "Wild At Heart" back before Christmas I think. Excellent book!  I highly recommend it to all men and to women who are willing to take an honest look at a man's journey to become a man and to be open to how we, as women, have at times taken away men's manhood.  Great book.  I believe it has definitely made me a better wife and mother!  I'm also reading back through the O'Malley Series by Dee Henderson.  They are fairly light reading, in a way, but she always brings new light to the different questions non-believers raise as to why they don't believe.  I love the O'Malley family and it has given me a good picture of what family means and what I'm searching for.

       SURVIVOR!   I really enjoy the game show Survivor!  And I'm excited as the next one is the All-Stars!  It will be Sunday, Feb. 1 right after the Superbowl!!!  I caught the CBS Early Show telling who the 18 survivors will be.. and here they are!     From Pulau Tiga:   Jenna L, Susan, Rudy, Richard  From Australian Outback:   Tina, Colby, Alicia, Amber, Jerri  From Africa:    Ethan, Lex, Tom  From Marquesas:   Kathy, Boston Rob M  From Thailand:   Shii-Ann  From Amazon:   Jenna M, Rob C.  From Panama Islands:   Rupert   Chapera Tribe  will be:  Alicia, Amber, Rob C., Rob M (Boston Rob), Susan, Tom  Saboga Tribe  will be:  Ethan, Jenna L., Jerri, Rudy, Rupert, Tina  Moga Moga Tribe  will be:  Colby, Jenna M (the winner), Lex, Kathy, Richard, Shii-Ann  It will be in Panama at the Pearl Island location again.  They said that the way they chose who was going to be on the All-Stars was they asked all 112 who have participated before whether they were available.  Then from those available they looked at who were the faves of the public and who had created the most drama etc.  2 people they picked said no..they didn't say who it was though.  There 18 survivors this time and there will be 3 tribes, but that's all they really said.  They asked Jeff Probst whose torch he was looking forward to snuffing the most and he thought for awhile and then said probably Richard Hatch because "he needs it".  It definitely should be interesting and entertaining!

       Friday Five!   Just a little behind this week..sorry!  Actually there is no Friday Five for last week, so I'm doing the one for Dec. 26 since I missed that one with the holidays and all!   1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year?  Let's start with a hard one huh?  Hmm.. biggest accomplishment?  Probably facing some issues with my past.  It was difficult, but working through it is bringing about a healing that couldn't have happened any other way.   2. What was your biggest disappointment?  That's something I'd rather not say out loud.   3. What do you hope the new year brings?  More understanding of people who don't know God.   4. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions? If yes, what will they be?  NO!     5. What are your plans for New Year's Eve?  We had a party at our house with our best friends, The Millers and my adopted sister Nikki :)

       Happy New Year!   The last couple of weeks have been a blur!  I was hoping that Christmas Break would be a time spent relaxing with the family, watching good movies, playing fun games, and maybe even reading a few new books!  Oh my goodness, that has not happened!  I have got to spend some good time with family that while it was fun ended up being under strained circumstances.  My grandmother was sick the week before Christmas and got really bad the week of Christmas and finally passed on the day after Christmas.  While we all know where she is and are thankful that she is no longer suffering, it was a stressful time for all of us.  Also, right before Christmas we found out that my oldest son will have to get tubes put back in his ears :(  The procedure is fairly simple and there should be no complications, but we were hoping that this problem would be far behind us by now and instead it might stick around a bit longer.  So we go Tuesday, Jan. 6 to have that done, and to make matters a bit more sticky, Josh will be unable to go with me because the other guy he works with took vacation that day.  So prayers are greatly appreciated.  As I was thinking today, I was kind of astounded at the things that have happened the last couple of weeks and wondered why everything seems to happen at once.  And the reason usually is, because it makes me forget about God. Not completely mind you, just enough that He sits on the back shelf where I throw in a few..help me out here God a couple of times.  How easily I allow that to happen, but am thankful that He gently reminds me in many ways that He is there to carry what I'm going through.  Thanks God!   Friday Five  (I missed last weeks--sorry!)   What one thing are you most looking forward to . . .    1. ...today?  My hubby coming home from work!   2. ...over the next week?  Getting through Jacob's surgery!   3. ...this year?  Camping with my family this summer!   4. ...over the next five years?  I have no idea.   5. ...for the rest of your life?  Just seeing where God takes me and my family!

      I think I like this once a week blogging marathon thing..lol  Sorry you all for not writing more regularly.  My life is stuck in fast forward!    Friday Five! (Or Thursday Five if you're late like me!)     When was the last time you...    1. ...went to the doctor?  Thursday, February 12   2. ...went to the dentist?  somewhere between 1986-1989 (I had a horrible experience and have yet to conquer my fear to return--I'm a wimp)   3. ...filled your gas tank? I filled it on Sunday (Feb. 22) when we got home from visiting Josh's parents   4. ...got enough sleep?  Ugh..probably about 3 weeks.  I have not been sleeping well   5. ...backed up your computer?   Me personally?  Umm..I don't think I've ever done it.  Ouch.  I think Josh might have done it before? My wonderful friend, Brian, has on a couple of occasions been able to retrieve numerous files when my computer locked up :)    Survivor All Stars!    Rob C bit the dust.  And I personally think it was a very wise move of Boston Rob.  Not that I'm happy Rob C is gone, I liked him and all, but he definitely was a very real threat to Boston Rob and definitely cannot be trusted.  It will be interesting to see what happens this week.   BY the way, I saw a preview of tomorrow night's show and they said something to the effect of "the losing team of the immunity challenge will be dissolved"  Hmm.  They could  totally get rid of a team or they could take that team and divide it up on the other teams.?.  So I guess I'll have to wait and see.   Oh and an update on Jenna M that came from Anna:  " just read an interview by Jenna M - she explained that her mother had been battling cancer for like, 8 or 9 years, that it had just become a part of life for her and her family. I wish I could remember where I read it from.. but anyway, since I can't remember the exact phrasing, basically, she was living her life and not sitting around for a whole decade waiting on her mom to die. I'm glad she was able to be there with her at the end."   Thanks for filling me in!       Books!    I started  The Magician's Nephew  by C.S. Lewis over the weekend.  My brother-in-law got the series for Christmas and let me borrow the first one.  It's ok.  I'm not a big fantasy fan, but was curious.  It's not too bad.   Anna recommended  "She's Undone"  by Wally Lamb, which I picked up at the library this afternoon!      My Weekend    We went to Josh's parents for the weekend, which is in Alton, IL (about an hour away from St. Louis).  It is always fun to go visit and relax.  They are such laidback people and it is nice to just hang out and share life with them.  This weekend they got us tickets to a hogroast dinner and a concert with a band (country-yee rah)that is pretty popular in the area.  We agreed to go so we could spend some time with them, not because we enjoy that type of thing really.   Anyway, so we went and as I sat there I came up with a 4 step plan for our Easter service at The Crossover.  We've been struggling with how to get new people (specifically unchurched) to attend our services.  This night gave me lots of great ideas!  Here's the plan:   1.   Get a fiddler!   While in the restroom I heard several people talk about how awesome the fiddler was and that you can't beat a band with a great fiddler.  (By the way, the fiddler was really good--and I'm not a big fiddler fan!)   2.   Bring on the Jell-O shots!   I'm telling you this is a definite moneymaker!  We can pull in people PLUS increase our offering.  Can't beat that!  These things went like hotcakes!   3.  Add a really good dancer!   They had this young kid that was a pretty good country dancer and he had the crowd up and clapping and laughing and having a great time.     4.   And last but not least, end the service with a rousing rendition of "I Got Friends in Low Places"  or some other song where everyone can sing along.  After the jell-O shots, everyone seemed a lot freer to dance and sing loud.   Needless to say, I am a sheltered person who is unaccustomed to bar behavior.  It was fascinating to watch.  I just don't get it and I can't say that I'm sad that I don't get it.  It would be interesting to learn these people's stories.  I'm becoming more and more fascinated with people's stories.  I think that's why (in general) people are so intrigued by reality TV.  It's learning people's stories!

       Outsmarting Dial-up   In the hopes of not losing everything I type, I'm am going to take  urlLink  Anna's   advice and I typed this up as an email and copied and pasted it. Thanks for the heads up Anna!   Survivor All-Stars     BRIAN--if you haven't watched the one from Feb. 12 yet, skip this section!    OH my gosh!  Jenna M. (previous winner of Survivor Amazon) walks!  Ok, now for the full story.  Jenna's mother is a cancer survivor, but from the way they made it sound, she was in a cancer center, so she must have gotten worse.  ANYWAY...Jenna went ahead and came to the game anyway.  Well she felt terrible almost immediately for doing so and hesitated on whether she should stay.  Finally she voiced her concerns to her tribe and said that she really thought she needed to leave because if anything happened to her mom and she was out here playing a game she would never forgive herself ( well-duh !).  So anyway, she tells Jeff at the next immunity challenge that she wants to go home and they take her off by boat and at the end of the show there is a little written update thingy that says 8 days after Jenna got home her mother passed away!  How awful!  I'm so glad she did go.  But there is part of me that can't believe she came in the first place, but I've done some pretty stupid stuff, so who am I to talk?    The show really wasn't that interesting last week, beyond Richard's (the gay guy who won the first Survivor) shark wrestling match that ended up with a shark bite for Richard and a Richard bite and becoming dinner for the shark!  It was hilarious, Colby (from Survivor Outback) says, "Can you call a gay guy a stud?  Richard, you're a stud."  lol.  That was pretty funny.  All in all, Rupert is doing poorly..he made a mess of the reward challenge in my opinion, Ethan's future looks much brighter.  Richard is by far the best player and has a great chance of winning if he can dodge Tribal Council for awhile until he gets some friends.  He is so smart about people, but he himself is such a jerk (or appears to be..like I really know him!)!  Colby is doing well with Richard on his team, it gives him a chance to not stand out. The girls, with the exception of Kathy & Jerri, aren't doing so well in my opinion.  Amber has a chance if she can keep her wits about her and keep her hormones under control.  Well anyway, enough of that until after the next episode!   Friday Five!    1. Are you superstitious?  Nope.  But I do feel a bit funny about walking under a ladder??  Go figure.  And I didn't let my hubby see me until I walked down the aisle at our wedding.   2. What extremes have you heard of someone going to in the name of superstition? I haven't.   3. Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition? I love the tradition of the groom not seeing the bride on their wedding day until she walks down the aisle.  I just think it is so romantic.     4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual? Luck?  I guess not, I mean I don't have anything special that I hang onto.   5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?  I don't.  Why?  The honest answer is because I was brought up not to.  That it was of the devil and evil etc.  I have never looked into it to actually see what I believe.  I don't think God set things up so that we could tell the future by the stars etc and that as the moons and stuff change that that affects us in our lives.  But do I know for sure?  Of course not, but He's never led me to look into all of that so I don't think that is how He set it up.   Tie-Dye   Have you ever tie-dyed anything?  Oh my gosh, last night my girl scout troop tie-dyed t-shirts and it was SO MUCH FUN!  They look so cool and everyone's looks different even though we used the same colors and similar ways of banding the shirts.  I highly recommend this as project to do with your kids on a rainy day.  It is relatively cheap.  I bought 2 kits from Wal-Mart for $9.97 a piece and we did 11 girl shirts and 1 adult shirt and I still have plenty of dye leftover.     Pajama Day!   The kids and I had Pajama Day on Monday since there was no school and it was so much fun.  We had breakfast and lounged around and then did some puzzles and read some books.  After lunch Jumanji was on, so we watched the rest of that and then the kids played Nintendo and I read and book.  It was a wonderful LAZY day!   Books!   I finished up  The Act of Marriage , which was pretty good but outdated..I think the copyright is 1970 something.   I also finished my Mary Higgins Clark book which was ok.  I like some of her stuff, but she is a bit descriptive and that gets on my nerves.  I'm not sure what I'm gonna read next.  I'm looking at  Waking the Dead  by John Eldredge as my non-fiction and maybe  The Magician's Nephew  by C.S. Lewis as my fiction. But haven't decided yet..  Suggestions are welcome!

       I HATE dial-up!   Have I mentioned lately that I HATE DIAL-UP! It is SO frustrating!  I wrote out this big long post and then I went to post and publish and the stupid thing wouldn't work because my dial-up had disconnected (FOR WHAT REASON- I DO NOT KNOW!) and so I lost my whole post.  MAN that's irritating.  SO this is it for now, because I'm too frustrated to retype everything.

       My Apologies!   Life has definitely sped up the last couple of weeks!  So I haven't been able to make time to get here and I haven't been able to make time to participate in Blogger Idol either :( Unfortunately I don't see how I can possibly continue that anyway..it takes SO MUCH time!  I can't believe how long it takes to read all the blogs etc.  It's an awesome idea though!   Survivor All-Stars   I have made time to watch my most favorite TV show though!   This season is off to a good start :)  The most difficult thing this time around is that the survivors were not given matches or anything else to help them start a fire.  The first tribe to go to tribal council was not allowed to take fire back either!  The main problem with the lack of fire is then there is also NO drinkable WATER!  Yikes!  Anyway at the first tribal council Tina (winner of Survivor Outback) was voted off and in the second tribal council Rudy was voted off.  The same tribe went to both tribal councils--ouch for Saboga!  SO we'll see what comes next this Thursday!   Friday Five!   Just playing a little catch up today!  Thanks for reading :)   1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done?  Daring thing?  Hmm..  I am not daring. I once drove around a curve at 55mph when it said to take it at 25mph and the people with me about had a coronary, which was funny, but that really isn't daring, it's just stupid.  (I was 16 at the time)   2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of?  Mother?  Skydiving..she'd have a fit!   3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle)  I would say probably a 4.  I'm not a risk taker.  And I tend to take less risks the older I get.  If I'm in the right mood, I might be really silly, but I usually don't do anything considered "risky".   4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky?  I got to travel to Brazil South America when I was 17 to visit missionaries our church supported.  I went all by myself and I had never even been on an airplane before that visit!  Of course this had more to do with God than me being risky, but it still was pretty bold/risky.     5. ... and what's the worst?  I'm not sure...because most things that have seemed "bad" because of my boldness have actually been valuable learning experiences that ended up being very good for me!  I'm sure there is something, but it's not coming to mind immediately.

       Books!   I just finished  She's Undone  by Wally Lamb.  It definitely held my interest and he did a great job of weaving a story.  But man the book was depressing!  For the last couple of days I've been in a very "blah" mood and I really think it's this book.  This woman is SO unhappy and so many terrible things happen in her life.  It's really exhausting.  Can't say whether I liked the book or not.    Next I'm going to read  The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe .  I heard on the radio today that they are making a movie of this book.  Interesting :)   Survivor All Stars!   Ding Dong Hatch is gone!  Whoo Hoo!  Way to go Colby!  Of course I'm not sure that this will help Colby in the long run, but at least we don't have to worry about Hatch winning.  He underestimated people!  Now I hope Colby doesn't make the same mistake because I think Jerri is out to get him!  What was up with Hatch's behavior?  I mean it's one thing to make an off-color remark..but then to continue..ugh!  I told Josh that I bet a lawsuit is going to happen over that and Sue will win too.

       HEY LOOK--It's ME!   Yes, I'm still alive!  It's amazing huh? Sorry about the long hiatus (Is that how you spell that?)  Life gets stuck on fast forward sometimes in my life.  So to catch you up..   NO VOICE   I have no voice.  I'm not speaking metaphorically, I'm speaking literally.  I literally am speechless and it totally stinks!  My throat was scratchy on Sunday and after leading worship for XO Kids (crossover kids..our "kid's church") and then helping out with the Easter Egg Hunt after church, well my voice started sounding kind of grovelly (is that a word?).   Anyway, I woke up Monday morning and it was GONE!  Ugh.  From what I've read on the net, it could possibly be 2 weeks before it comes back.  Great!  OH well..so here I am!   TAE BO   So what have I been doing with my time since I haven't been blogging?  Tae Bo!  I need to shed some pounds and get some energy and so I've been exercising since like January, which is pretty huge for me who is not a disciplined person.  So instead of reading blogs and writing mine, I have been taking that time to exercise.  But I have yet to find a spot of time to get back in here regularly :(  Bear with me!   SURVIVOR!   So far the All-Stars have been playing pretty well.  Most people are making excellent choices as to who is getting the ax!  Boston Rob better watch out, because there couldn't be a larger target!  It's been very entertaining the last couple of weeks and I am excited to see what happens next!   BOOKS!   I have been reading, I am now on the 4th in the Chronicles of Narnia Series....Prince Caspian.  They haven't just been fabulous, but they are interesting.  I've read a couple of other novels in there as well, but none of them have really been "wow"!   MOVING INTO THE 21st CENTURY!   I am on the move baby--cable modem!  HELL-O!  What a difference some speed makes when you go surfing!  No more waiting for 5 minutes while your page loads or waiting 30 minutes to an hour for those important updates.  Only looking at one page at a time?  No more, with cable modem I can look at several webpages all at the same time without frustrating delays and constant lock-ups!  I should be a saleswoman for the company, because I am in love :)   IN CLOSING   I hope that you all have had a good holiday and I can't wait for the warm weather!  I'm not really a summer person, but I absolutely love 65-70 degree weather and I am tired of the cloudy days and am looking forward to some sunshine!  Thanks for listening!

       WHOA--Blogger Updated!   I guess I should get on here a bit more often and I would have known Blogger updated--Oh Well!   STAR TREK TEST    I did this Star Trek Personality test because I'm a copycat and one of my best friends did it, so I did too :)  here are my results:   Myers-Briggs would say that you are an ENFP (Extrovert, Intuitive, Feeler, Perceiver). In Star Trek language, you share a basic personality configuration with James Kirk and Julian Bashir.  People like you are generally great problem-solvers. You're highly innovative, creative and unique. You're optimistic by nature, which may make others believe you're naive, but actually you're full of energy, very clever, and determined not to be stopped. You're outgoing, curious, and extremely playful. Others are sometimes taken aback by your enthusiasm, but it keeps you going after others have dropped.  You're deeply caring, sensitive and gentle, which, combined with your need to solve problems, may make you a little too eager to give others advice. You also process information very quickly, which may make others believe you're not listening to them. Before you share your feelings, you have to have time to process them.  You're adaptive and resourceful, but sometimes highly disorganized. You dream of having the perfect assistant. You respond best to people who encourage your unique viewpoints and insights, help you maintain harmony, and want to play and explore with you. You don't respond well when you're overwhelmed with details or when you're in a rigid situation.  Your primary goal in life is freedom to see possibilities, make connections, and be with a variety of people. Your reward is having spontaneous adventures.   Good careers for your type include being an advertising account executive, starship captain, career counselor, developer of educational software, actor, graphics designer, corporate team trainer, psychologist, inventor, medical pioneer, and child welfare counselor.  I was kind of surprised, I thought it was pretty accurate!  You can take the test  urlLink here!    ILL   I have never been so ill in my life!  I got started feeling funky on Monday and by late that night I had the flu SO BAD!  It was awful.  I asked Josh to stay home on Tuesday because I could barely move!  I finally feel at about 80% today.  Thank you God!   ONE OF THE BEST DAYS EVER!   Last Thursday, May 6 was one of the best days of my life! All three of my kids made decisions to follow God!  I was thrilled to be able to discuss and pray with each of them!  Talk about exciting!  My children are 8, 6, & 5 and my 8 year old daughter has been working up to this decision for a long time.  She's been asking a lot of questions, worried that she doesn't understand, and been pretty emotional during some "special" times at church (Christmas Eve services, baptisms etc).  So I was pretty excited when we started discussing what being a Christian meant that morning in the bathroom while I was fixing her hair!  By the time we were done she told me she thought she was ready and and so I asked her a few questions and then I prayed and she prayed!  Awesome!  After school I encouraged her to share her experience with her brothers, but she was a little nervous.  But somehow the conversation wound its way around to being a Christian and my 5 year old piped up and said, "I'm not a Christian." To which my six year old said, "Yes you are." Which of course turned into an "am not/yes you are" argument and my 8 year old said "No he's not"  Which lead into another discussion of what a Christian is, and by the end both boys were adamant that they wanted to become one.  My 5 year old blessed my socks off by eagerly praying first and saying something to the effect of "Jesus, sorry I do bad stuff.  I need you to help not to. I love you. Thanks. Amen"  Talk about an emotional day!  THANKS GOD!   BABY ON THE WAY!   One of my best friends who has been my best friend since we were like 3 is having a BABY!  She's been trying to get pregnant for over a year and has been very discouraged.  Her one dream for as long as I've known her was to get married and have a passle of kids and now God has blessed her with her first one!  She's due in December!  THANKS AGAIN GOD!   SIGN OFF   I think that catches you up with the most important stuff occurring in the last few weeks!

       I WON!   My husband and I enjoy playing poker (Texas Hold 'Em specifically).  We got started by watching the World Poker Tour on the Travel channel and then got online into a couple of poker sites and have since really gotten involved in the strategy of it.    We've been playing for at least 3 or 4 months (I think more, but I'm not sure).  And I have yet to win a tournament.  I have gotten 2nd NUMEROUS times and have done really well just playing at a regular table, but I have NEVER beaten everyone in a tourney!  And tonight--I DID!  I was so excited!  It's just for play money, but it was still fun!    To make it even better, the tide really turned when I got pocket deuces (translation for non-poker players: dealt a pair of 2s) while I was in the big blind (translation for non-poker players: kind of like a forced ante) and I raised.  The other 2 players went all-in and I called and ended up with 10s and 2s, and they got nothing.  One guy had more than I did, so he got some money back ($495), but wasn't able to recover!   Go me :)

       POISON IVY   All three of my children have poison ivy.  The youngest just has like 4 little spots on his arm, but my middle son has it ALL OVER!  My daughter has it pretty bad as well, but it seems to be containing itself.  So we all trooped to the doctor's office yesterday to make sure it was just poison ivy and to get some meds to help it clear up.  We sat in the waiting room for 45 minutes.  Then we sat in the little exam room for 15 minutes.  And we spoke to the doctor for all of 5 minutes.  I kid you not.  I timed it, and 5 minutes is rounding up.    What is the deal with that?  You call and make an appointment, you would think this would help.  But no, it just ensures you will get seen that day.  It drives me insane.  I am not a patient person anyway and then when I have to sit and wait, it just gets me all riled up.  AND THEN, we had to go to Wal-mart to get the prescriptions filled.  She said it would take 15 minutes.  That's fine.  So I go to a pay phone to call my hubby to let him know that I'll be able to pick him up from work, and we browse through the shoes and look at a few other things and 15 minutes later we walk over to the pharmacy to pick up our prescriptions and she says that it's not done yet, it'll be a few minutes.   Ok, so we stand there in the medicine aisle, because I really need to get going to pick up my hubby on time.  The kids are being rowdy because they are tired of being still, so they're playing London Bridge and some kind of Kung-Fu fighting game.  And the lady who told me it will be just a couple of minutes is yacking to the other lady in the back.  She's not doing anything--neither of them are!    Talk about blood pressure going up about 15 points.  OH man.  15 minutes later she finally calls me over and hands me the meds and THEN informs that they didn't have enough of the one medication and I'd have to come back the next day after 5pm to pick up the rest!  I'm not a happy camper.

       VBS IS OVER!   My last quiet morning! Guess who complained that it was time to go yesterday?  The youngest!  Guess who complained that today was the last day?  ALL THREE!  Thanks God!  The week was good for the kids and they had a good time.  The week was good for me too!  I really enjoyed my mornings to be able to get things done without constant interruptions.  It's amazing how productive one can be!    Have a great weekend!

       VBS   The kids are going to VBS at the First Baptist Church in Casey this week. So it's giving me a little taste of what this fall might be like with all 3 of them in school!  Yesterday wasn't so bad because Josh took a vacation day (it was his birthday!), so we ate breakfast together and watched a movie on TV.  Today hasn't been too bad, I've caught up on my blog reading and am actually updating mine!  I still have an hour to go though..lol.  The hardest part is my youngest didn't want to go back to VBS.  Yesterday he told me (in front of his teacher!) that it was boring and he wasn't coming back.  After I got him home I figured out that a couple of his friends didn't really include him in their playtime and that he missed me.  Poor guy.  The mom in me was a tad bit excited that I was missed, and mad at the little boys for not including my son.  And as much as I would have liked to keep him home and play with him this morning, I decided my best bet was to encourage him to give it another try.    He went, but only after the other kids told me that they passed an offering plate yesterday and wanted to know if they could bring some money to give and while I was passing out quarters, my youngest wanted a quarter too and I said that it was for VBS and since he wasn't going he didn't need the quarter to which he replied, "I am going."  So hopefully the quarter got put in the offering and not pocketed by my child as a bribe..lol :)

        LONG WEEKEND       &nbsp;  Whew, what a week, and what a weekend!&nbsp; Seemed like I was swamped everyday from the time I got up until bedtime!    &nbsp;  Bagelfest was, let's just say interesting.&nbsp; I had some really odd things happen to me, that have never happened before. My good friend Danelle, reminded me that these are the people God wants to reach, regardless of whether we want to reach them or not.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  It was a good reminder.&nbsp; Because all weekend I was amazed/shocked/and even angered by people's behavior and what I really wanted to do was say that I would never do this again.&nbsp; It's not worth it.    &nbsp;  How selfish of me.&nbsp; God never says that about me.&nbsp; It doesn't make people's behavior ok, but it does give me a bigger picture of what God is about.    &nbsp;  So God, if you want us at Bagelfest next year, I will help put it together.&nbsp; And thanks for the people who were really grateful.

        PERSPECTIVE        &nbsp;    Ok, so I didn't go back and finish up the dishes.&nbsp; I decided to check out some blogs first.&nbsp; And I'm glad it did, because God whammed me upside the head (as He often lovingly does :) )     &nbsp;   I checked out this  urlLink http://www.urbanonramps.blogspot.com &nbsp;blog that my friend Brian had on his blog and my "perspective" was definitely changed.&nbsp; You'll have to go there and read the latest post to see what I mean, but I need to update my list...     &nbsp;     IT'S THE LITTLE THINGS  &nbsp;    &nbsp;    Like, when your monitor on your computer goes out, you have an awesome friend who is willing to loan you another.  &nbsp;  Like, when outlook express won't let you see your emails, you can be thankful that you use hotmail and can check your email anyway.  &nbsp;  Like, when your children aren't getting along, it means they are in the house with you and healthy and ok.  &nbsp;  Like, when you and your husband are just in a "blah" stage, it doesn't mean anything except that you're just both feeling "blah" and you'll get over it!  &nbsp;  Like, when you have severe headaches because of weather changes, you know that it will eventually pass and there is nothing seriously wrong.  &nbsp;  Like, when you have pop-up ads that drive you insane, it reminds you that you really shouldn't be surfing the web anyway, go play with your kids!  &nbsp;  Like, when you let your dishes pile up and you have to wash them all by hand--be thankful that you have a house, with dishes, and had food to put on/in those dishes, and now you are healthy enough to wash those dishes!     &nbsp;   Thanks for the perspective God!

Like, having severe headaches because of the frequently changing weather.     &nbsp;   Like,&nbsp;pop-up ads that take up your entire screen and you can do nothing to stop them. &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Like, allowing your dishes to pile up and then having to face cleaning them all--by hand.     &nbsp;    So I'm venting.&nbsp; Kill me.&nbsp; This week has been filled with the "little things".&nbsp; The little things which seem to set me off.&nbsp; I don't know what my deal is, but these little things get under my skin and cause me to&nbsp;want to explode.&nbsp; (maybe there really is some truth to that personality quiz..lol)     &nbsp;   Anyway, I'll be fine.&nbsp; Really I will.&nbsp; Just had to get it off my chest.&nbsp; Now I'll go finish up those blessed dishes!     &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       Fun Quizzes!    urlLink 20 Questions to a Better Personality   Wackiness: 26/100 Rationality: 30/100 Constructiveness: 30/100 Leadership: 48/100    You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.    urlLink 20 Questions to being a better person   Your score as a human being is 35.55.   Good Lord. You have some severe deficits of people quality. Who do you hang out with? Who do you date? What is your deal? I hope at least your grooming is good.   There is hope for you, of course. Rededicate yourself to the greater good. Plant a tree. Volunteer at a soup kitchen. Anything, for the love of Pete.   Self-esteem is good, but without other-esteem it doesn't get you very far.    urlLink Jung Typology Test   I took this test with a Star Wars twist a month or so ago. I got a different result this time.  Last time I was a ENFP.  Go figure :)  Provider Guardians [ESFJs] take it upon themselves to arrange for the health and welfare of those in their care, but they are also the most sociable of all the Guardians, and thus are the great nurturers of established institutions such as schools, businesses, churches, social clubs, and civic groups. Wherever they go, Providers take up the role of social contributor, happily giving their time and energy to make sure that the needs of others are met, that traditions are supported and developed, and that social functions are a success.   Providers are very likely more than ten percent of the population, and this is very fortunate for the rest of us, because friendly social service is a key to their nature. Highly cooperative themselves, Providers are skilled in maintaining teamwork among their helpers, and are also tireless in their attention to the details of furnishing goods and services. They make excellent chairpersons in charge of social events. They are without peer as masters of ceremonies, able to approach others with ease and confidence, and seemingly aware of what everyones been doing. And they are outstanding hosts or hostesses, able to remember peoples names, usually after one introduction, and always concerned about the needs of their guests, wanting to insure that all are involved and provided for.   Providers are extremely sensitive to the feelings of others, which makes them perhaps the most sympathetic of all the types, but which also leaves them rather self-conscious, that is, highly sensitive to what others think of them. Because of this Providers can be crushed by personal criticism, and will work most effectively when given ample appreciation both for themselves personally and for the service they give to others. This is not to say that Providers are afraid to express their own emotional reactions. They are quick to like and dislikeand dont mind saying sotending to put on a pedestal whatever or whoever they admire, and to come down hard on those people and issues they dont care for.   In their choice of careers, Providers may lean toward sales and service occupations. They have such pleasant, outgoing personalities that they are far and away the best sales reps, not only regularly winning sales contests, but earning seniority in any sales group within an organization. Observing ESFJs at work in a sales transaction reveals clearly how this type personalizes the sale. They are visiblyand honestlyconcerned with their customers welfare, and thus the customer is not simply buying the product, but is buying personally from the Provider. This same characteristic causes them to be good in many people-to-people jobs, as teachers, clergy, coaches, social workers, office receptionists, and so on. Providers seldom become a source of irritation in the workplace; on the contrary, they are unflagging in their devotion to their company, and show such personal loyalty to their immediate superiors that they make invaluable personal secretaries.      Guess I have some work to do huh?  lol :)  Thanks to  urlLink Brian  for the links!

       WHAT TO DO   I don't like feeling helpless.  I have done everything that I can think of over the years to learn how to deal with every situation that comes to me.  I've learned how to lean on God to get me through the tough times and to give me the wisdom I need to make it through.  But there are still times when God just allows me to suffer through, and not to be able to solve a problem or help in any way.  I'm there now.  There are 3 situations that have occurred in the last week that have made me feel so helpless and confused as to what the next step should be.  So I'm waiting, impatiently mind you :), and hurting.  I'm not saying this is a bad thing. I have complete faith that God will use this time for whatever He purposes.  But it still hurts.

        HOWDY!       The Village, was VERY good! Wonderfully creepy! I love M. Night Shyalaman's stuff. The guy tells a great mystery! Definitely see it. (As far as teens go, I think this one might be ok, unless your teen struggles with scary stuff.)      I finished the book, The Last Juror by John Grisham. It was good, not great. But a pretty good story. That was the first book I've read of his. I like his stories that have been turned into movies--The Firm, The Pelican Brief, A Time to Kill etc. I thought it was kind of funny, I was reading the author's note at the end of the book and he states very clearly that he took poetic license in the time frame and actual events of desegregation in Mississippi, so please don't write him and tell him how he got it wrong. I thought that was so funny!      18 more days and school starts here! Crazy! This summer flew by!
