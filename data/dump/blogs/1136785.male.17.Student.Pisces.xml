       I don't really enjoy writing, so on the off chance someone is viewing this, imagine that my prose would be good enough to make Shakespeare's ears bleed in jealousy. Or go read something good and pretend its me.

       I'm only posting today because I won't be able to do it for four more years. A great swell of pity goes out for the diseased vermin/children brought kicking and screaming into the world today. It's sad to think that you will never make past the age of thirty. Sucks to be you.  Also, I am posting because I should be rewriting my term paper, but you know what? Fuck that. Fuck that fucking shit up its fucking unformed ass. Actually scratch that. I will not go down in a flame of stupidity along with all the other drama queens. Who cares that I have spent this entire weekend working on that damned musical? Or that I have skipped lunch for the past week to work on it? HOLD IT! What did I say about being a whiny drama queen? So stop it! Anyways, I've joined the glamorous circles of playboy, people, and the bible for crapper reading, so I must rise above! I will say this though; If I didn't admire and aspire to be a Romantic and/or Byronic Hero so much, I would have killed every last person in this damned show.  Some of the people are cool I guess. The only reason I don't gush is that I don't want to add fodder for the people (like me) who simply read blogs to find out what the author thinks about others. Us gossip whores are stinkers, ain't we?  Yep, that about wraps it up I guess.   Wow, Lord of the Rings won ten or eleven oscars. Huh. I guess people weren't lying when they said New Zealand was a real country. Guess I should write a paper.

       Why must my e-mail mock me with all of its penis growth ads? Do I not feel enough shame every time I look down in the shower? Damn you, you purveyors of broken dreams!  I've been suffering from increasing amounts of anger fits lately - you know those times when you can feel the bile bubble up in the back of your throat, scalding and scarring your vocal cords with pure, unrelenting hatred. Funny thing is though, there's not focus. No one single person, place, or thing other than the musical is really upsetting me. All it is is simply remembering my past failures, and BOOM! I must be really fucking insecure. That sucks. Oh well, made up disorders are better than real ones, I suppose.    I SUPPOSE? What the fuck is that? Thats the problem! INSECURITY my friend. You can't fucking suppose, you got to fucking KNOW. I KNOW this or I KNOW that. You don't fucking suppose things! You need to seize life, and tackle it to the floor, and fucking pistol whip it. And while its down, you need to kick it in the side, flip it over, and piss all over its back. That should teach life a thing or two. You can't fucking do that while you're busy supposing. You got to be knowing! You got to be decisive! You can't even fucking decide where to eat! If someone asks you where to eat, you can be all fucking "I don't care" or "I don't know, what do you want?" You got to be all fucking "We ARE going to Chipotle right now and we are going to fucking like it." You need to apply the fucking willpower to all your hopes and dreams too. What the fuck do you get by dreaming and hoping? Jack fucking squat. You need to go out there and do shit. Don't keep saying you're going to do a fucking independent study or write and article for a voice. You NEED to write that mother-fuckin article right here and now? Are you gonna let Beecher do it instead? I better fucking hope not, you sad sack of shit! So, from now on, I order you to be decisive!   Ok.   WHAT DID YOU SAY?   Yes Sir!   I CAN'T HEAR YOU!   SIR, YES SIR!   Good, now hit the showers and go to bed, cause you may be the craziest goddamned boy I've ever seen.

       Bwahahahahaha!   urlLink How do I love you? Let me Snort a line.   Score one for the people who always knew love was like being a coke head! Now I can make fun of all the people whom I was jealous of, as their filthy fucking addicts. Losers!   Yeah, so the musical fucking sucks. Watching a bunch of monkeys dance around stage is bad enough. Teaching a bunch of monkeys to act while dance is simply hellish.  Staying until 8:30 PM to watch said teaching can only be equated to having a rabid male porcupine in heat shoved up my urethra, while simultaneously having pure, concentrated stupidty injected into my oxygen deprived brain. In other words - it ain't fun. The coming monday will prove to be one of the most painful in recent memory. Oh well, it will come, be over, and then I will eventually die. Hopefully I'll lose my virginity in between those last two, though losing it between the former could be fun.

       I am so fucking tired.   If I had the Muse in me. (ie; the sheer force of will to post goth and/or angsty poetry) I would probably use that starter as the beginning of some lyrical diatribe of how I am tired of life, tired of choking on its sick excess, on its simple monotony. But really, I'm just fucking tired - the physical exhaustion from a lack of sleep. And sleep, with its ability to cure cancer (according to Stanford), is about the healthiest thing one can do.  I'm a fairly happy person, if not a particuarlly mellow or happy one, or even a excellent speller, but I do know this; blogging helps me not do my term paper. I'm sorry to abuse you, my deliciously sexy readers, but I am merely involving you as a pawn in a game as old as time itself - procrastination. You see, though my term paper shouldn't be exceptionally difficult to write, and the subject is quite interesting ( The FBI/J Edgar Hoover's reaction to the Civil Rights Movement and its reflection on Goverment Policy), I am against writing it on principle. Therefore, I will waste as much time as possible not writing, ending up doing all the work at roughly 3:00 AM the morning of the deadline, despite the fact I had a four day weekend. Ain't I a stinker?  Speaking of movies, you know what was quite good? Triplets of Bellville, a french animated film with only one, repeated once less than thrice, important line of dialogue, which was thankfully translated into english. All other interaction through main characters was done a-lingual, and though there was much French background speech and signs, it would almost ruin the experience if I understood. The other interesting aspect is that I saw it with a group of people, bar one, I do not typically see outside of my school lunch period, which is always a cool thing. It brought me back to my freshman year, when I was "adopted" for a brief period by Eddie Fonner, who proceeded to take me to social gatherings (bowling), much to the recalcitrance of other members (Sylvia). Luckily, I believed I performed much better than way back when, in those years of  intense hormonal awkwardness.  Well sheeeit, it's pretty damn easy to write when I only focus on myself - though the grammatical construction and spelling of the above leaves me quite worried on the outcome of this term paper. Meh, C'est la vie.

       Man, where have all the happy people gone? These days if you're not permanetly in a perky depression ( the kind everyone must know about), you must be simply too angsty to feel. I would even be happy to see all of last year's bi-polar seniors, as the manic moments were simply brilliant.   Feh, perhaps I'm not the best one to speak of this. I actually got asked to WPA, and we're getting sushi! I love sushi, as the raw fish is most conducive to running up my date's credit card - at least in a cost per pound ratio.   I should probably understand some amount of low feeling, what with all the death going around. Eighteen year olds or the parent of a teenager shouldn't die/be killed. That ain't cool. On a somewhat serious note, I probably should feel bad that I don't feel worse.  Awww yea...there's that sweet, cheerless, bleak, desolation. Where's my lithium! If  don't even myself out I'll start feeling better that I'm not taking pills - and if all the cool kids feel shitty, I want to too.  (Author's Note:[serious] Humor is a method of dealing with pain and any death truly is a tragedy. Though I did not know them personally, their lives affected those who in turn affect me, making it close enough to hit home. [/serious])

       Well, whoop-de-shit. I'm back. I can't let my baby go untouched for more than a year, can I?  So, in keeping up with my annual posting method, I also changed my template, using al of my incredible knowledge of HTML (see Webmonkey) in the process. But fear not dear readers, by which I mean me. I have not "gone" goth; this set-up is merely a result of penis envy.  Yep, thats it. See you next year, and don't stop being beautiful (all non-beautifuls will be killed on January 1st, 2005).

       Holy shit, I just woke up and my body aches like cambodian war criminal. And all I did last night was get home from Chicago, go to Cully's, and play with the EyeToy. Thats right, Tyson has a fucking EyeToy. For those of you not in the know, an EyeToy is a little peripheral device of sheer brilliance for one's playstion two. It is a small USB camera that you attach to your PS2, and it superimposes you in any of the twelve games it comes with. I know it sounds stupid, but the entire interface for the EyeToy, from the menu to the games, is done through your body. Its therefore perfect party game, as you get to watch people make complete buffoons of themselves as they try to swat away little ninjas or dance to the beat on screen. Genius I say! Add in the fact that I got it for fifteen bucks becuase the Sony store in Chicago was having a 'closing its doors' sale, and everything is golden!  Chicago was fun, the delightful immaturity of a family trip. I got to see my oldest sister who shares my brother and I's birthday (she is twenty-one now) who is pretty cool I guess. I also got the see my other older sister, who was born on May Twelfth but still gets a birthday card and money from my stepmom, who isn't simply stupid, but is more of a mobile void of knowledge, manners, and intuition, actually taking those away from those near by her horrifying presence. My other sister can actually be a lot like my stepmom, so she has her own painful moments. Brother was there to, no particular problem with him. But enough of my family, as the trip is the thing! I know you're all dying to hear what I did in Chicago so...TOO BAD! Hah, I deny you your Tyson sustenance for the day! Thats right, suffer as you did in my absence, like a flower struggling to survive without the nourishing rays of the sun! Ok fine - second city, bull's game, Splendors of the Forbidden City during the Glorious Reign of Qianlong (1736-179'5', when he 'abdicated and continued to unofficially rule the country for four more years) which was awesome indeed, and other random shit. There, now you have my trip - read it again and again so you can feel a modicum of the pleasure that my company always brings.  But now, its time to get down to more serious matters. Those of you linked from my....I shudder to say...xanga (which with two entries telling people to come here still compares favorably to the greater body of xangas out there) know of what I speak. On Wednesday, March 31st - the first wednesday after break for you Pembroke People - Student Goverment Presidential elections shall be held. I for one do not intend to give the performance I gave in the past five elections I through myself into, even embarassing myself in front of six hundred moronic Yiggists. No, I will no longer be a nice guy. This exact location in time and space calls for something a little more 'dramatic', if you catch my drift. My only competition I know for sure is Joe Reardon and Aroop Mukharji, along with rumors of Emma Cohen, whom each present unique problems. Joe is brilliant and a great guy, but a tad stale. Some say that will work against him, but I personally believe that his unique form of humor (that is, no humor) which will deliver all sort of clean, dry jokes will be so cute as to be funny. Thus Joe has the tiny puppy angle to work from. Aroop is actually somewhat funny and unlike me (having been banned from the stage since freshman year) is actually somewhat known by the entire school. But what Aroop hasn't been is be a member of student Goverment, except for the one semester at the beginning of Freshman year which was enough to qualify him and perhaps as Julia's secreatary or something,  so he has a weak experience record. Emma, well she's a girl and a great person at that so she could dramaticaly cut the vote simply by appealing to femnists and the like. Thus, I need a campaign that will grind every last one of them into not dust, not the molecules that form that dust, or even the atoms or quarks that form that, but into the very theoretical Higgs Bosons that cause mass to appear in most objects in the universe. And if I'm wrong, don't fucking stop me I'm on a roll. So not only do I need a concerted poster movement, with a sprinkle of door handles, but I need nametags, shirts, you name it. Most of all I need my loyal gestapo to help me destroy the competition. My feeling is for a nice Deaniac flavor this year, with all the squaks, flash get togethers, and such that come along with that style. My speech will be prepared by an expert committee to ensure full wit this year. Any ideas for how to support the campaign can be posted  in the chatterbox or comments. But I'll need a loyal core to be laiden down with shirts, candy, and name tags to hand out for those two and a half days we get to campaign. If you're willing to be my Deaniac, simply post and I'll do my best to get shirts, nametags, and the like to you. This is my year damnit! They may have pushed me to the side like so much spoilt milk last year, but I shall overcome! ICH BEN EIN PEMBROKE! DIE KUNST IST GOD, TYSON UBER ALLES!  Oh and Emma B, I know very well of Alex's  urlLink xanga  and hold it as one of the shining stars that threaten to destory my perception of xanga as a whole. I simply do not link to it for I already link to Sam's. Sam's links to four or five blogs/xangas, which include Alex's. You see, I very much promote the idea of self-discovery when it comes to these things, making all the more magical. It is how I found them all. Sam's links mostly link in a self referential group, but Alex's is not so. He may have no links 'per se' but he has a plethora of comments. Each one of those comments link to a xanga which may be a real one or a merely a placemat link for the user's actualy blog, diary, live journal, or whatever, many of whom link to someone new. Its like starting at the top of a pyramid or the center of a spiderweb and spreading further and further out - quite fascinating really. And my own perception of you remains quite resolute and firm.   Shit I stink! I need a shower. And on that less than glorious note I'm off!

       Well, my day in the sun has come and gone. It was a good day, if low key. Spent some time with my mother, and then some time with my Father. A bountiful harvest of books and DvDs was wrought, and all was well. Now no one can say I don't own Season Three of the Simpsons, Futurama, or South Park or Seasons One and Two of Strangers with Candy. If my taste in TV doesn't tell one anything about me, well that makes sense. A person isn't defined by their favorite TV Shows - I mean come on, Sam Ryan loves the Chappelle Show and he's still a fairly decent human being, right?  No I kid my dear readers - Chappelle Show isn't half bad. Speaking of readers, I've seem to been graced with some of a much higher class as of late. Though I know not what luck allowed them to pass my little corner of the world wide web, I can be assured of one thing -  a vast feeling of being underwhelmed and anti-climax. None-the-less I shall soldier on, confident that even intelligent readers may forgive the pit they've fallen into. And too prove that I'll never be done flirting on a mediurm that is essentially the bathroom wall writing of the world, my newest readers are prettier, funnier, more charming, and overall better people as well. PLEASE LOVE ME!  Sorry, I seemed to have regressed back to my youth. Back to Tyson. Not only am I still behind in my history reading, I have found a critical error in my quest - the lack of notes. If I am seriously to take that AP without the class, I should take notes over the plethora of books I am reading, to grant a better memory on that ever nearer day in May. Also, I have yet to look over Latin. Shit me on a shit stick. That class will be the death on me, and though one could liken it to an airplane slowly descending into the Peruvian Alps, where the survivors will be forced to eat the dead for sustenance, the group whom I share the class with have made it as enjoying as hell - not an exception among the bunch. Except for Corbett. I hate you Corbett (OMG LOL ROFLMAO JK!)   While on the topics of airplanes, I will be on one in a matter of tens of hous. I am traveling to the Windy City for a nuclear family reunion with our father as parent attendant. It should be fun - I haven't been to Chicago since last year's Thespian Trip. Ahh, all the fond memories of being thrown out of a hotel's private party and Jesse and Jimmy being mugged becuase they were stupid enough to ask a huge (black, if thats important) homeless guy in a back alley for directions to Walgreens. A real couple of bright bulbs there, aren't they? Well Mr. Browning, stressed from from our 'mischeveous' antics (I swear I didn't know it was a  Private  Party!), refused to allow another Thespian trip - but this should make up for it somewhat. We'll see Second City, go to the Billy Goat Tavern - pretty sweet. Along with a Bull's Game and dinner at RL (Ralph Lauren's exclusive and most likely mediocre restruant), it should be a good time overall.  Hmm. I seem to use hyphens alot in my writing. Is that a sign of being contrived and having poor english skills? Discuss, as I still need to pack.

       BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  SEVENTEENS YEARS!   Yes, it is true! I was unleashed upon this earth exactly seventeen years ago. To quote Owen Glendower from  Henry IV Part I :  "Give me leave To tell you once again that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields. These signs have mark'd me extraordinary; And all the courses of my life do show I am not in the roll of common men. Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales, Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me? And bring him out that is but woman's son Can trace me in the tedious ways of art And hold me pace in deep experiments"  Dayuumn! I'm either stupidly arrogant or arrogantly stupid - perhaps both. Either way, hooray!  Wow, seventeen years...this is astounding. I remember when I was ten as if it was right now, but somehow I'm seventeen. This lightning quick pace of the passage of time is somewhat frightening and comforting. The constant imposition of a boundary that my own mortality places is always a scary thought, but it is not for me to avoid the reaper - just to live as well as I can until the inevitable. I can find comfort in the fact that no matter what, I am going to die. I have no choice in the issue, so why fear it? And just to throw off those who think I may have found inner peace, I'll let slip the light of my own insecurity - Who knows, I could break the curve. Fuck, I'm falling behind in my readings. I need to finished with near east history and onto 'In search of Modern China' by the time I leave tomorrow.   Also, I decided to throw in another movie review. I saw 'Secret Window' ( THE SHINING ) yesterday with a delightful little group and a hot dog. Secret Window ( THE SHINING ) was good. Its plot ( THE SHINING ) twists were so ( THE SHINING ) unexpected. Johnny Depp (JACK NICHOLSON IN  THE SHINING )  is such a good ( THE SHINING ) actor. If only he could ( THE SHINING ) get more ( THE SHINING ) roles. Alack, ( THE SHINING ), for Hollywood doesn't recognize ( THE SHINING ) greatness. John ( THE SHINING ) Tuttoro was also ( THE SHINING ) quite good. He is so convincing as ( THE SHINING ) a mississippian! I wonder if he ( THE SHINING ) has ever visited ( THE SHINING ) the great state of ( THE SHINING ) Mississippi or its neighbors? Overall, ( THE SHINING ) this may be the greatest movie since ( THE SHINING ) Hildalgo.   [PS: If you didn't catch my sarcasm, in which case makes me question your ability to properly use the internet and theorize that you are likely some cat playng on the keyboard- or perhaps an incredibly smart ficus- Secret Window sucked. It was contrived, stupid, boring, and a rip off of, GASP, the Shining - which is especially sad from the same author. Someone told me that Secret Window was written before the Shining, which makes me questions the need of a movie of a proto-Shining anyway. The only scary part was when it took a Buried Child turn for the worse with corn at the end. I'm still shaking. The people I saw it with are still cool though, if slightly tainted.]

       Hidey ho readers! I is back, and now in spring break form! Yee fucking ha! And in roughly three days, I shall be even closer to death! Thats right, the glorious day where upon I was brought into this world as the savior of man is coming fast! And it happens to coincide, as it does every year, on the drinkinest day on the calendar - St. Patty's day (Though it may soon be known THE DAY OF RECKONING FOR THE COMING OF  THE TYSON, its current humbler label shall do for now)! Aww yea! Seventeen on the Seventeenth! It's my golden year!   But this spring break is also a bad thing, as it means that the end of spring break closesly approaches. I'm not a pessimist or a fatalist, but at the very end of spring break I am retaking the SAT - oy vey. This means, in order to improve my score in math, I must study with my handy prep book over break. But that's not all! Not only must I keep up my studies in my AP classes (ie; Latin) so I don't become totally inept over break, but I also opted to do someting quite foolish. I am taking the World History AP without taking the class. While I did get an 800 on what is apparently one of the easier SAT IIs, my memory over these events long into the past has somewhat dulled. And the AP focuses keenly on post 1000 CE world, and I have a severe deficit in my knowledge of post 1500 Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Thus I went on a Border's spree, and I have thousands of pages to read before the AP, with hopefully enough time to review and practice a DBQ. BUT I SHALL PREVAIL!  RIDE THE ADRENALIN! I may simply be in a manic phase, but I feel great! Now I leave you, for I much reading to do, and much information  about the past, the present, and people to absorb.   (PS: Hildalgo sucks. Viggo Mortesen is okay, but the rest is kinda slow and boring - which is odd for a horse racing movie. The plot was interesting enough and it was cool to see stuff I've read about like Wild Bill's Western Round UP, but it was so poorly paced. Also, Viggo finds another reason to sing in a esoteric languange, trading Elvish for Sioux. It's not that I don't like foreign songs, but Viggo manages to sound both pretentious and stupid whenever he does it. Especially in such 'unique' languages.)

       HAH! Take that God! You thought you could wear me the fuck out couldn't you. But I won this round in this little ongoing war of ours, didn't I? Yeah, thats right. G o stumble out of the room crying like the pansy you are. Fuck it, you'll be right back tomorrow ready with another rabid wombat to shove up my ass. Stupid whore.  If one knows the slightest bit about me, than its quite easy to figure out what I am frothing about - Footloose. Thats right, you've fucking heard it, the beast is slain. Michael himself has come down from the heavens above to slay the seven headed monster, by which I mean a musical based in the 80s. And you know what? Despite all my best predictions, the show actually came through. It took Mr. Foley crying in sheer confusion over how to help them, but those fucking idiots figured out what to do. Except for the Trio. They tried harder than anyone, made the most improvement, but sometimes bad casting cannot be overcome. Sorry girls, my heart goes out to you.  Shows always make me feel wistful, at least they have this year. I'll admit that I'm an attention whore, like most actors, and that being carefully shoved backstage isn't really conducive to my needs. But I can take it. I know that without me, this damned show would have ground to a halt, and without this running crew, it could have been disastrous. Do I get any thanks though? From Mr. Browning and the other 'actors' when they're forced to acknowledge me. But, really I don't care. I can manage to go out into the lobby after a show, and merely stand in a corner why everyone is pissing themselves over hugging those with even the most worthless parts. At least its a musical, so don't feel as bad not playing a part.  But you know what I can't stand - other fucking whiny 'actors'. Actual thespians these people apparently are, with an entire one show underneath their belt. And all they do is whine and bitch about the chorus, complain how their parts are tiny and full of teh magical sux, and cynically scoff at the mere existence of the musical - but once the show is over, their just as ready to soak up everyone's compliments and thanks. Looking for that damn 'adrenalin high' acting apparently gives. Afterwards, they complain chorus shouldn't be their at all, that none of the "non-actors" should be there, that its not for them. What the hell! How fucking conceited are you not to share your miniscule spotlight with a few damn others, just cause they normally don't devote their entire lives to shows, but have this strange ability to sing and do sports instead. I know chorus didn't work that hard, that they pissed and moan, but to take the words from another "Chorus is what makes the big show." If they didn't finally get it through their acorn sized heads that they had to do something, it would have been terrible, rather than above average. So stop fucking bitching about how terrible your life is, forced to share everbody's attention with a few more people. People who are "too cool" to act, "too cool" for drama, yet not "too cool" to have you not expect to lick your fucking boots after a normal show. Shit, how addicted can one be to acting - and I have to wonder if they could survive the "withdrawal" I've gone through. Do you know what fucking happened to me? I loved to fucking act, its was some of the best times of my life, and I loved to be on stage. And the year started great with the one acts. But suddenly, for the fall show - nothing, left out in the cold. Worse than that, I was stage manager - so my job was to come to rehersals every damn day and watch people slowly learn to act.  Fucking watch.  And I also wasted sixty hours bulding your fucking sets, not that you could help. I did more work for these shows than you could imagine, but only now that you've ticked me off do I truly complain - moving from joking to fucking pissed.  And so day in and day out, I was relegated to being Mr. Browning's aside, to watch the slow fuckign realisations that acting may be tough come over your damned faces. I busted my ass so you could come out after a show and get thanked by your adoring fans, all the while I watch, remember what that used to be like, and than feel bad. So shut the fuck up you stupid fucking whores. Jesus Christ.  Damn I'm emo. Llook what you've done to me. You've made me all pissy and moany like you. I need to feel good again. Baby, I never hurt you again, you can trust me. Baby? Baby?

       Hell fuck yeah! I knew this blog would pay off for me. I love you Barry - what you proscribed may not be the best service but at least it basically works! Hah! Gmail is my service now! Take that hotmail! From my basement, I stab at thee!   Wow. I just think I used more exclamation marks in the above than most modern novels do. That obviously shows I am at the forefront of some new writing style, one that will bring the literary world to its knees. If you thought that piffle Joyce had talent, just wait for Tyson!  See I just did it again. Look at how much better things are with in the brand new Tyson style of writing:  Boring current style - I went to the store.  Super Awesome Tyson Style - I WENT TO THE STORE TO GET SOME CHEESE! OH YEAH! THE CHEESE WAS GREAT AND I WON THE LOTTERY! SWEET!  I think we can easily tell the better of the two. But onto bigger and better things.  Prom was last weekend. All I can say is that I enjoyed it thoroughly, even though I feel like a douche because I may have made her cry - despite assurances by a close friend  and herself that she had a good time. Despite the obviously romantic conotations that go along with the late night walk through Loose Park, I do not think it went in that direction. Once again, all's I will  say is that it was a great time indeed and I hope thats a mutual feeling. Don't take my silence as meaning something happened. I simply don't feel the need to recount the night bit by bit.   Speaking of a close friend - I almost did something that would have driven her away. She thought I was rejecting advances from her she though that I thought I percieved, but I was merely trying to find out if the advances existed. I am much to selfish to be put into a relationship where one would rely on me, and I would possibly kill myself if I failed and ended up hurting her. But everything's cool now, I hope. In fact, I'm using her as inspiration for the betterment of this blog. I fidn myself wanting to at least put it some some modicum of use beyond my own indulgence. But I am not so arrogant or confident to post poetry and the like, as then I would be forced to write poetry. But I do find it somewhat disconcerting that many people have no knowledge of event beyond our own state, let alone country. So, starting whenever I feel like it, I will begin linking importanat news around the world - the boring yet important  stuff. As for my inspiration, I also find I tend to be a wealth of depressing informaton, so I hereby dedicate a section to the new "Emma's Good News Journal" to show people that the world isn't so bad. To start, I was originally going to do it in paper form, but now I decided to do it here - so I already saved trees! Go me! Lets begin!   Boring, yet Important   Today we focus on the news lite. If you have not heard about what is going on currently in Hong Kong than you truly are no follower of world events. But it is important none the less. Hong Kong, which was handed over to China in 1997, has finally run into the friction of clashing political systems that was destined to come despite the "One Country, Two Systems" promise. The People's Republic of China has slowly begun to flex its control more and more, and now they have officially announced there will be no direct elections in 2007. A  people's democracy is no longer needed in Hong Kong. Read about it  urlLink here .  Undestandably, this has caused some more friction between east and west - namely the USA and UK.  For the USA the crushing of democracy will always bring criticism, and yet another bone besides Taiwan to pick. Even with the current fights in the WTO, nothing truly inflammatory will spew fourth - simply because of the USA's desire to maintain the status quo in the region. But the UK is another story. The UK feels no small loyalty to Hong Kong, and is actively criticising the moves of China. China, for its part, has  urlLink lashed back  in a bitter condemnation of the farce the UK called democracy that used to exist in Hong Kong.   What does this all mean? Its hard to tell, but it should show that the Central Committee is getting scared. More and more entrepenuers are popping up in China everyday, and discriminating against millionares is hard when more keep coming. Many local companies are operating with only one party member on the board -  alone, no longer dominating company action. Hong Kong, though a shining example of an Asian Dragon economy wise may prove to be a pandora's box if not contained. So the Committee will crush western style democracy there before it can spread. A short, mediocre analysis. But all I have patience for. I find this reverse reunificaton of the Germany's fascinating, as though the economic prosperity is much more clear in this newer example, the political ramfications in one of the most important countries in the world are incredibly murky and possibly not good. We can only hope that the Conservative faction of the Party does not use Hong Kong as a invite for a knee jerk reaction against the Parties' more liberal elements, thus sending China back to an earlier time politically. And yes, I do understand the irony in characterizing the incredibly radicaly communist sections of the party as conservatve and the ones more open to capitalistic democracry as liberal.   Emma's Good News Journal   -One of Saddam Hussein's many sadistic punishments was to cut off the right ear of Iraqi men who were deemed to be traitors. An estimated 3,600 Iraqis lost their ears that way. But the newly formed National Iraqi Association for the Defense of Human Rights is now paying for reconstructive surgery for those victims who want it. Khalid Abid Nimer, 33, was one of the first beneficaries. "It feels so good to be able to walk around on the street again and not be embarassed," he said, after kissing his doctor on the cheek. "I'm reborn."  -Apr. 22 - The number of Americans driving hybrid cars jumped more than 25 percent in one year, a trend that is expected to continue because of high gas prices and automakers' plans for more hybrid models. There were 43,435 U.S. registrations for hybrid vehicles last year, a 25.8 percent increase from 2002, according to figures from R.L. Polk & Co., the Southfield-based firm that collects and interprets automotive information. California had the most registrations for vehicles with environmentally friendly gasoline-electric hybrid engines, followed by Virginia, Florida and Washington.

       April 20th man. Not only is it Hitler's Birthday and National Weed Smoking Day, but also the fifth anniversary of the Columbine Shootings. I only mention this because of a Slate report on the incident, which I personally found fascinating. It may not be anything special, but  urlLink it  threw a whole new light on the event to me. - especially the perpatrators. A whole new definition on psychopathy took me by suprise as well.   Laramie is a struggle, but whatever. I'm too tired to worry about my lagging spirits and psyche. Prom is this weekend, and that has the possibility of being very cool. Gmail, the google mail service is great, but hotmail lacks any fowarding service. And I'm not paying money to have email fowarded to a new account. What a crock.  I have loads of latin to do, so I instead of xanga-ing - I'm just gonna leave you with something actually amusing.   urlLink CUSHIONED PANTS FOR THE TRUE SPORTS FAN!

       Holy Mary Mother of God, Wife of Joseph surrogate father of god but not real father of god who is in fact God God not Jesus Christ God - I'm a little fucking bitch. This damned blog has turned me into some fucking thirteen-year-old goth chick. Things shall change!  In fact, I'm going to start writing like a gossip columnist! ITEM! I have just returned from a trip to Yale University, which, despite efforts to assure me that was the least Yale of all weekends to come, is like a giant KU Honors program. I don't know if that is a bad thing, just merely an observation. Hmm...yep. Thats all I really have to say about Yale, other than it was a fun, interesting (if not enlightening) trip. If you want a deatiled itinerary of a college trip, I suggest to visit  urlLink sam . Oh, and whichever of Gail's Stalkers who read this - first, do not Kung Fu Dance in front of an open window, it don't look cool. Second - Gail got grinded and lapdances from her three fairly attractive and talented roomate/suitemates/girls from across the hall. Go stroke it to that.   Oh ye gods in the heavens above I am vulgar! Mine caustic tongue is not meant for the serenity of the masses, only to spite them into roaring frenzy! Not self indulgent enough am I to post poetry ( for than I would have to write it) but merely to continue the constant dictation that flows throughout that brilliant vessel that forms the heart - scratch that - brain of Tyson! Some may simply call this stream of conciousness writing, but I tell them that if you would dare to compare me to the likes of Joyce than obviously something is wrong with you - c'mon, Joyce doesn't nearly compare to me quality wise! A fie upon thee who is not me! Hah! I like that - I hereby declare that unofficially and without any basis in fact my senior quote!   Whew - I need to calm down from an adrenalin high, especially considering the rough spot my life has reached. Its the usual story - commiment to play was more than I expected, the weight of homework threatens to crush my spine, ect, ect. But I shall not focus on that! In fact, lets look at the good in my life. HOLY CRAP! I just asked this cool girl to prom at the end of my latest 'vote-for-me' speeches (in a decision to put those horrible things to good use for once) and she not only said yes, but her parents did too. Parents, you ask? Why should they be involved? Well, dear readers, this sweet girl is merely a sophomore, and thus not a typical prom attendee. Some may accuse me of robbing the cradle, but I think of it more as robbing the braintrust - somewhere in the dark empyrean that forms this quaint experiment called existence, a supermassive (certainly class O) stellar object shone brilliantly, because there ain't nothing that can keep up with her. I'm simply happy I don't have to compete with her in college admissions - my grade is tough enough. Despite the predictions that this was just another stupid leap I took without thinking it through, I'm confident that Prom shall go well - because if it doesn't, a specific Buck will gore me until nothing corporeal remains. I only use that modifier because I'm certain after recent deoderant experiments something mephitic will remain.  I finally won an election - go me! Its not the one I wanted, desired, dreamt of, had any motivation to perform - but if you saw who else was running for it you would know I would have had to run. I will now be the Representative to the Board of Education of the Board of Trustees next year. I'm going to see just how much I can toy with these abominably rich and powerul rulers of our school without getting burnt. But something even more important happened on the student goverment front - my victorious oppisition for President made his first announcements today in assembly - and you know what? To put it bluntly, he sucks. To put it flowerily, his words were a malodorous miasma the punctured the eardrums of his uncouncious audience, like the cries of some small child trapped down a well desperately wailing for help in hopes that she might not die, but failing because she is ugly. Hmm, that wasn't that flowerily. Oh well, me and my self-loathing tells me that ugly people suck. Hah! Self effacing humor indeed!   His failures have encouraged me in one regard - that I still have a chance to win the hearts and minds of the people! I shall be the Mao Tse-Tung to his Jiang Jesei, and once his corruption and failures have caught up with him, I shall crush him and his Guondimang like a bug under the flyswatter of the people! I have already taken the first steps on my Long March, and becomed purged of my weakeness by the cleansing flame of pain. I cannot intitiate a revolution, but I can ressurect an old idea - the Historical Society, not in the new form of the Education Society. Verily I must educate the masses of their ignorance, and keep a weekly newsletter to constantly remind them of the mistake of their decision through its own genius. Stupidly arrogant you say? I wouldn't have it any way. I must go for now, but I also have big plans for this blog - a veritable fountain as copied and pasted information which I just decided is a new idea that no one has done before - so hah! I'm off, and I'm manic!

       It's over. It is completely fucking over.   Those who know me may understand what I'm referring too, and I ask the Yalies in the background to humor my melodramatic emo-ness or find another goddamned spot to flirt.   It is true - my last, my best chance of political redemption proved to be yet another fevered dream of a madman, who never got that it is no longer freshman year out of his head. Those were the days - at the mere drop of the hat I could crap out some comedic bullshit and win any election in the blink of an eye. Almost without effort I was the president of our Freshmen Class (admittedly only in second semester as I was disqualified for insulting my opponents for the first one) and as the President of my Sophmore Class as well. In that time I set up both Homecoming and WPA! But the end of my sophmore year proved that the days of wine and roses were sorely over. I, unconcievably, lost my bid for Junior Class Election, against Julia fucking Falk - a complete unknown who was apparently much more popular than me in the Junior Class. I who had two years of experience, of building dances, of Student Goverment, of the Non-Academic Life Committee! After overcoming the bitter sadness and acidic anger (look at me, I'm fucking alliterating) at that loss, I sat myself down, said everything would be ok and moved on. Thereafter I went on to lose three more elections in a row - two of them in the same club. I was the only one who voted for me as Thespian President and Vice-President, and the only one to vote for me as YiG President. This one still riles up my blood if only for the quality of the people I lost too, people so repugnant (at least back then) that it makes me want to vomit. Luckily, thereare three At-Large Representatives for the Student Body, and I was one of three who ran, so I nailed that one! I then went on to promptly lose the chance, which all At-Large Reps have, to become Vice President of Student Goverment. My year was over, and I was infuriated. But I managed to calm down, and believed in the possibility of bigger and better things.   Junior year started abruptly enough - theater proved itself all the more harder for me to pretend to skilled at, what with the influx of new, actual talent. But that's niether here nor there. Actually, I'm wrong - its fairly related. With the loss of any actual role in play and therefore that much responsibility I was left with more time to dream, more time to piddle around. Luckily this time was concurrent with Youth in Goverment, and I finished my plans to run as a candidate as Governor from the Western District. I was the only one to file the paperwork on time, so that nomination was mine! But I showed up late to the district convention, and thus they openened to floor t more candidates. One of these candidates who seld nominated themselves was from my own, the Pembroke Hill, delegation! A scream of "I'll gut you from neck to sternum" certainly did not help my chances to win the nomination. Some are creatures of their humors, but I am one of my bile.  And yet I prepared a speech, where in one part I stated "I'm also stage manager for our current play - and if I can keep a bunch of monkeys in line I think I can make a fairly effective governor." The person after me, representing an absentee who had never entertained any thought of being Governor, simply stated "Vote Tougis, because he won't call you monkeys!" THE FUCKING BASTARD TWISTED MY FUCKING WORDS! And of course his delegation dominated the Western District, and despite being the only one to properly fill all of work on time, and prepare to be governor, I had lost the nomination - no thanks to my own delegation.  The sheer rage that threatened to melt my hear cannot simply be measured at this action. I believe I literally began, as I left, to almost cry and convulse.  But I eventually convinced myself to continue YiG, and I went to the convention - no small thanks in part to the fact I learn I could be a write-in-candidate for governor. It would require over two hundred signatures from all over the four districts, but I was willing. I was all decked out with hat and sleek mafioso wear, filled with signs, nametags, and t-shirts proclaiming "Vote Tyson for Governor!" I got those damned signatures in less than one day, in-fact I was the first to get them in. I say first because another, the one who would would take the title, was also a write in. Now our district, the Western, is one of the smaller ones, nothing compared to eastern - which has all the massive magnet schools from the St. Louis Area. People have a tendency to block vote to support one's district, so I knew I had to leave a veritable blazing path across their soul with my speech. So what do I do? I FUCKING CHOKE! IN FRONT OF SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE I FUCKING CHOKED. Those are levels of embarassment that should not be known to one as agnsty as myself, but quite often are. 'Luckily' my speech was so bad I quickly made my peace with the election and simply hoped that the delegation of the liars (The actual candidate turned out to be a cool, if bland, hippie who had no real idea what he was doing) would suffer my fate as well. To no suprise, East swept the elections. I still felt like shit, but I managed to jump immediately into another role in a group I actually cared about - Chief Lobbyist. The Lobbyists this year seemed to like me, and with my failed bid for governor and my previous awards as a Lobbyist, I had hoped that I had that in the bag. But no - there was fourteen people in the room. We all voted and our adult leader announced that it was a close race, seven to six. The current chief lobbyist, whom I considered a a decent friend, suddenly remembered that she hadn't voted - we were all anxious, worried that this could be a seven to seven split. So she whispered her choice to our adult, and he said '"Good Choice, eight to six. Congratulations [blank]" She had voted against me in front of my own eyes. There wasn't even any semblance of secrecy for whom she voted for! As per my personality (Drama Queen/Prima Donna) I immediately sank into another depression and spent the bus trip home moping.  But in my heart (Man am I in a fucking soap opera here?) I knew that this was not what I was truely preparing for. I was going to use this failed leap for sovereignty as an example of what not to do for the prize I truly desired - Student Goverment President.   It may be hard for some of you to understand just how much I wanted that spot, why I sunk over one hundred dollars of my own birthday money into my campaign supplies, or why I'm acting the way I am now. Student Goverment President is the position I've desired ever since my first assembly in High School. He got to make all of the announcements, to be as funny or as serious as he wanted. But more than that, he actually did things! He assembled the blood drive, helped with the Valet Auction, raised money for Jan-Term Scholarship - and so much more. Depending on his will to actually work, he could completely change things while in power! Clubs trembled in fear for the hope of clemency in his desicions. Any action affecting the student body was routed through him. Sure this was the way I could prove myself! Soon, that mantra became "Sure this is that way I can redeem myself!" Now, you may have been questioning my motives for running throughout all of these elections - and its hard to explain. I kinda fell into it, like theater, but then is became a method of self-improvement. I have always been terrified of speaking in front of people, of leading a group on the correct course - what better way to overcome this fear than force myself to perform these very tasks repeatedly? It was all probably linked to the fact that I've never grown up, that I still harbor delusions of grandeur, of being some superhero or god to the masses. My bloated ego was blossoming full speed.  So I prepared like I've never prepared before for this, the grandest of all elections. I through away all trifilings of perhaps joining the newspaper, making my own Historical Society - all silly notions - and focused soley on the prize. I even laid out a decent speech, and got together a core of friends to make the impossible possible. We spent hours (admittedly on only one day) making posters and T-Shirts, and I spent hours more making smaller, computer posters and nametags. I got to school early and plastered myself everywhere. I was taking this seriously - but so was my opposition.   But the two and a half days of campaigning are negligent now, and my speech, though actually good this time, probably didn't affect the vote at all. It was declared a tie between Aroop and I, with Joe knocked out, and that there would be run off elections monday - today. Aroop and I were both tired, and agreed to no more campaigning, which I still hold probably would have not done anything. Maybe I was wrong, but at 12:10 am April 5th, I failed yet again. I've lost more elections than I would like to recall, and frankly I'm kinda tired with this whole system.  I was unable to get a senior class slate together because the due date was friday and the extension in elections made it impossible, so that left my major standby unavailable to me. I can't practically create my Historical Society, as it would merely appear to be College Resume building - so I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I don't know if I'll go out for At-Large again. I know I could win, and probably be Vice-Pres too. But I don't know. Its bad enough that I'm gonna squirm at assemblies in envy and jealousy, but I don't know if I can serve under him. I'm just tired, fucking mentally exhausted. I've lost the spirit, and realized its over. Its bad enough to overhear why people didn't want me while strolling through the halls. Sure I hate them even more, but even thats lost its spice. All this hate and anger, yet no outlet. I don't know how to feel about this anymore, other than I'm going to be so fucking emo for the next day or two.  I find it highly ironic that I'm going to go memorize that overdone hack solliliquy from Hamlet now.

       Once again, it has been a while.  And so much exciting stuff has happened!  School's over, finals done and gone, graduation came and went....thats about it for the non-Tyson world. But for the truly important world, a relocation of the greatest magnitude has taken place! I am currently, and will be so for the next ten weeks, in New Haven Connecticut - Room J32B, Saybrook College, Yale University to precise. The actual action of getting to Yale was frantic, chaotic, tedioud, and boring all at once. All I will say is that somewhere along the way, I managed to pack 96 pounds of clothes into a massive red suitcase. I wasn't even aware I owned so many articles of clothing. I will admit, in my sleep deprived state on the morning of flight (five to six hours in advance) I did get into a fight with my luggage to prove I could so pack all of those clothes! Unfortunately I won, and will liklely have a hernia upon return to Kansas City.  I can't believe I even mentioned that, as classes just started today. Memorial Day - the sick bastards. I had to skip breakfast to head to a late registration for my single class, Elementary Modern Standard Arabic, and then immediately proceeded to class. Three hours where I was not so much taught the langauge as beaten with it by a large, very nice and intelligent, Sudanese Professor. Then followed purchasing of 165 dollards worth of text books. Then six hours of homeworks. Six wretched, working through dinner hours. But whatever, I knew this would be tough. At least there is pocky. I'll do more updates later. Much apologies to Emma, as her good news segment will be in and out depending on how much time I have. Same with the boring and important. Now I'm off!

       "You know I can't help you"  Something really struck me about that. It was told to me by one of my good friends in perfect honesty and (hopefully) care. And I just ran with it, but something about it didn't sit well with me. For some completely irrational reason I have felt incredibly lonely as of late (once again, for no good reason, making it all the more annoying) and that just kind of pricked me. I have to rely on myself wholely and completely even for my mental and spiritual poxes, which is for better and for worse. There is something starkly isolated and empty about it, rather than a feeling of being "total" and in control. If I was any more pissy, I could easily accuse those around me of abandonment - but that would essentially being doing my best of blowing a mild fit out of proportion and using all my effort to take others' actions and words the exact wrong way. I suppose it can all be traced to the fact how I'm an incredibly jealous, insecure, superficial person (at least at times). Whenever I walk around school, and I see me friends, I exchange greetings and what not - little more than that. Which is fine, perfect even when considering myself. But in the midst of all that I see them go "Oh look theres [blank], I have to go hug/kiss/sit with them right now beyond all else". Just those people everyone loves to openly love, to shower in PDPA (public dislay of platonic affection), and I just feel irked. I'm just patheticaly jealous of them, for no damn good reason. They recieve that because they are like that and their character demands/lends itself to that, and I get what I get because of who I am. If I wasn't me than I wouldn't be me and they wouldn't notice me because they couldn't see me because I wouldn't be me. This display is purely superficial and does not mean care is greater for others than for the rest, but what can I say - I'm a superficial guy. Man, I can't wait to go to Yale, so I'll have an actual reason to be lonely. Oh well, if I can just get good and pissed off about this, then I won't be sad, as I'll be cruel and vindictive.   WHAT THE FUCK! I NEED TO STOP BEING SO FUCKING EMO. EMO BAD FOR TYSON! EMO BAD FOR TYSON! STOP BEING A FUCKING PRE-PUBESCENT SCHOOL GIRL YOU LITTLE WHINY SHIT!   Whoa, that felt good. This whole living in my own tragedy thing is starting to piss me off too. Fuck it up its fucking ass. A whole load of whiny, weak, bewilderingly insane faux-emotions are just going to hold me back and mke me content to live with them. Some people have actualy reason to feel bad, and I respect that, but I sure as hell don't. Thats what this whole new template is about - my last one was too fucking gothy. I need to mess around with the chatterbox some more, but this is a start. So now, I officially renounce the emo-ness, at least until my next post.  So on to my favorite topic - me and the world revolving around me! Oh who am I kidding - that is the whole world! Hah! But let us see and delve into the fascinating world that is TYSON! Classes are now offcially over at school, which I really don't feel one way or the other about. I still have finals, and then I hop on a plane to Yale; so this whole longing for summer thing doesn't apply to me. The only noticeable thing that it was the end of the year was the annual award assembly, which was suprisingly very good for me. I shared the english composition cup (Technically the Paul Jr. and Herbert Hall Bartlett Cup) for Juniors with Jimmy O'Keefe. They always give it to two juniors as unless this is a extremely limited Junior class, they have to have two english teachers teaching two different sections of AP English. Which means they considered Jimmy and I the best of the best in two oustanding sections - a major honor. My taking two senior englishes that also happened to be taught by my normal english teacher helped as well I'm sure.   But even more suprising, is that I won a character cup. These are cups awarded based on criteria like "scholarship, leadership, intellectual curiosity, athletics" and such. Mine was the Rymar Cup (or as Sam calls it, the "Samuel Ryan Memorial Cup") which is awarded to a junior based upon the first and third of those example options. As the school puts it - "to a junior who has displayed outstanding intellectual curiosity in a broad variety of academic disciplines while maintaining at least a B+ average" - that last part may seem like a stab by the administration, but this is a very old cup that began before grade inflation - when a B+ was an outstanding grade. It saved my ass for this award at least. But my advisor was telling me about the process surrounding these awards, where the teachers all cast a vote for a student - each student that recieves one vote is put on the ballot for further consideration. Then they check whether they meet the requirements of a "B+" or "athletics" or whatever, and then cull the herd accordingly. After that, is what he terms "the most dreaded meeting of the year" - where the teachers essentially have to fight for the favorites and it gets incredibly awkward. Apparenty, whenever it looks like one kid may get it, one teacher will then being pushing for splitting the award, starting another whole row of controversey. He told me that there was a big move to split the award this year, and he and another one of my teachers went on the warpath against that, saying it would be an injustice to me - which is just, wow. It's just incredibly cool to have faculty that care for me and believe in me and respect me so much. It's an amazing honor and a privilege that some people would ignore, but I love the faculty here.   Of course, as long as I keep getting awards, I can say I don't care and that they're stupid. But you take them away from me I will throw a hissy fit of catastrophic proportions. Ah, sweet self centered hypocrisy.   Last night I was invited to Sam's Official Graduation Pary, which I went to after picking up his present a bit earlier than I expected. It was a great time - I got to hang out one last time with all my senior lunch buddies I (hope I) befriended over the year. I'm gonna miss them; truly a great group. And thats not emo, thats self-indulgent nostalgia, so hah! I mean seriously, who am I going to eat lunch with now? My own grade - not likely! But I also got to hang out afterhours with Mr. Young and Nina, Mr. Christian and his wife, among others. It was nice to talk shop with them out of school - refreshing in a way. 'Meeting' Sam's family (they already knew my name) and seeing his house was cool too - a blessed group indeed. Having all these adults whom I didn't know shake my hand and congratulate me on my awards was cool too. But yeah - I may only see these seniors two more times - commencement and graduation. After that I leave, and I don't know if I'll see them again until Thanksgiving. So good luck to you all, its been a great year.   Boring, yet Important   Unless something really strikes me as the most important thing in the world at this moment, I'm thinking of revising this section. I spend far too long writing what are essentially awkward copy and paste summaries. I end up linking to more informative sites, so I'm thinking I'm going to make this more like "Emma's Good News Journal" - brief summaries and links to the related issue. If something really is heads and above the singular issue of the moment, I'll go back to the old way. If this change is welcome or not, or more importantly, if anyone cares, feel free to post a comment or chatterbox statement. Personally, I feel people should be well versed in all of these events.  -The European Commission has lifted a five-year moratorium on genetically modified produce, by allowing the sale in Europe of one type of modified corn. But the battle by producers of such crops to win governments and consumers acceptance is far from over. As more studies have been completed on the effects of GM crops, the green lobbys case against them has weakened. Little evidence has emerged of health risks from eating them. And, overall, the studies have shown that the environmental effects of modified crops are not always as serious as the greens claim. Nevertheless, environmentalists continue to find fault with such studies and argue that they are inconclusive. If GM foods can be accepted by the industrial nations of the world, than more effor can be put into producing them by the third and first world alike. Brazil, a saudi arabia like center of the commodities exchange world, is already using some GM soybeans. GM foods may be one of the keys to reducing global hunger and malnutrition - bigger crop yields and much more needed nutrients - they can even be specifically tailored for the destined countries' needs, to some extent.

The leaders also condemned the occupation of Iraq and abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. troops, and they called for a resumption of Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.Arab League Secretary-General Amre Moussa said there was no discussion of deploying Arab troops in Iraq before a new U.N. resolution and a sovereign Iraqi government are in place."Arab forces cannot be part of an occupying force," Moussa said.

The full article it refers to is for suscribers only, and its to much risk to post my name and password for one article. Check it out in the print edition. This leader provided enough of the basics - how output is not the problem, as everyone but Saudi Arabia is already working at full capacity. Neither is increasing consumption the real problem, as America and Europe still consume far more than China and the like. The real problem has to do with speculation mostly relating to the threat of terrorist attacks. Oil firms in Saudi Arabia have already recieved some minor bruises, but if anything serious ever happens - one can expect to see a situation that is actually similar to the 70's oil scare, complete with stagflation - high inflation and low growth. Contrary to popular belief, not much harm has been done to the world economy as of yet - lusty growth is still the name of the game. The ones most hurt are those with growing industry and less efficiency - like India. Read more  urlLink here .

       Shit man. I can now unequivocally say that being sick sucks.   Thats right. Sick = bad.  Theres no way around it. I know I'm probably the first person to discover this tidbit of information, so I will hope to spread it to the ignorant masses through the most important electronic document archive in the universe - my blog.  The last two days have been incredibly trying for me, if only for the fact that I generally appreciate the knowledge that now I am awake, therefore I am not asleep. That comfy realization has been taken away from me, in my weakened drugged up state. Laying basically comatose in either my bed or my chair, not really remembering when I made the effort to move from one to the other, I essentially lost all track of reality. Slipping in and out of what can roughly approximate to a waking dream, I felt alot like blind/deaf/mute quadruple amputee Joe Bohnam from  Johnny Got His Gun . Or at least I would have, if coherent thought was possible on my part. I also decided that as long as I wasn't engaging in any perceived human interaction, I may as well be asleep - a sort of Shrodinger's cat theory of consciousness. So thats what I've been doing.  Well, thats nearly all of what I've been doing. As I became more and more ill over this past week, I found myself becoming more and more emotional. Typically I only have three moods - self centered jocularity, narcissistic rage, or conceited sulleness. I don't like mere thoughts can bring a tear to my eye. I don't like it when I'm so desperate for human interaction as some form of validation that I practically begin to hypervenalate. I like to consider myself above such things - certainly not implacably rational and logical, but at least colder than your average person. Having feelings is too troublesome a third of the time, and the other two-thirds theres no good reason. Everyone is suffering from the same damn thing, and everyone wants to be loved. So why the hell is my situation unique enough to demand some self-involved tragedy? Wow, I have divorced parents and a bad stepmom and crap siblings - thats so amazing! I must the be only person like this ever. Give me a break - those feelings are just giving into weakness. Its just teenage bullshit, and while I don't out and out disapprove, I try not to take part in it. I'm just glad I'm already queasy when these outbursts surge up.   Now that I have attained a state where continued existence is preferable to the alternative (what am I talking about? I love myself too much to ever prefer that. I simply longed for some subcouncious womb like state, which is what I wass essentially in) I can at least make some reasonable descisions about that existence. I think its tme I begin to withdrawl into myself again, not an unusual habit of mine. I've become overbearing and assholish, and that accomplishes nothing. Long ago, years,  I used to literally wait by a phone hoping someone would call me, so I wouldn't spend another weekend alone. But I soon grew up and realized I should be a man and that if I wanted to do something with people and have it in someway involve me , I would have to plan it and execute it. This is been my modus operandi for some time, being the planner again and again until the event is so regular that it runs without my involvement, but still requires it. But now I feel I've over extended myself - I essentially force myself upon people becuase they amuse/interest me. I open channels of communications and interaction entirely out of self interest, and force them to remain - ignoring the will of the other. I toy with people to make me feel better, making me a sadist in every sense of the word. I cannot consider myself at least moderately thoughtful (though I often don't) and allow this action to continue. I cannot permit such behavior on my part to go unhindered if I actually notice its existence. If I want to be decent to other people, I shouldn't force myself upon them. Luckily, I only have thirteen days left for this to be an issue - after that crushing loneliness shall lead my to renege on this idea and fanatically desire some equivalent of friends. I stress that I do realize I have some friends who I can easily talk to, but I also realize the distinction between the ones I prop up for me and the ones who are real.  Thirteen days...wow. I feel like Kevin Costner in that bad movie (wait, all his movies have that distincton!) I still haven't realized that I'm going to be holing myself off in New Haven, Conneticut for what amounts to my entire summer. Just to begin to lay the scaffolding that will allow me to get ready to commence building the foundation from which I can then learn Arabic. Somehow I've convinced myself of that absolute neccisity that I become fluent in that tongue above others. So while other people are laughing and playing, falling in and out of love back home, I will be freezing my ass off trying to decipher a completely alien script with people that will more than likely loathe me - with good reason, as I shall despise them. Why? I don't know damnit. Because it may be the key in my future to prove to generations just how much bigger my dick is than everyone elses. Good enough reason for me I guess.   Boring, yet Important  Firatly I encourage to check the the last one of these as I made an update regarding the fact that Sonia Gandhi has walked away from the position of Prime Minister of India.   Onto newer, all together more horrifying business. The United Nations had admitted it is "the worst humanitarian crisis in the world". In one of the better case scenarios, only 100,000 people will die from starvation and malnutrition directly related to this crisis. Roughly one million people have been displaced - the government has literally armed, unleashed, and given  carte blanche  to convicts, with orders to loot, rape, and pillage. They are even supported by the army and airforce. George Bush is seen as a source of salvation in this country, where he is possibly loved more then anywhere on earth.   Here is the story of one of the inhabitants:   HER children's bodies were rotting in the village wells, where Arab militiamen had thrown them to poison the water supply. But Kaltuma Hasala Adan did not flee her home. Leaving her crops and livestock would condemn the rest of the family to death, she reasoned. So she stayed put for four months, despite her government's strenuous efforts to terrorise her into flight  Her story is typical. Her village was first attacked in January. An air raid caught her unawares: as the bombs fell, she ran around in confusion. When the bombers had completed their return pass, the horizon filled with dust, the ground shuddered, and a host of mounted militiamen charged through the village, killing all the young men they could find. During that first attack, Kaltuma's 18-month baby, Ali, was killed by shrapnel. Two weeks later, her oldest son, Issa, 15, was made to kneel in line with other young men before being shot in the back of the head. Her husband disappeared the same day.   For four wretched months, Kaltuma lived with both ears strained for the faint drone of bombers, poised to dash with her three surviving children to a hiding place in a dry river bed. Then the janjaweedan Arab militia that kills for the governmentrode up to finish the job. They razed her village entirely. She fled from the embers of her hut and trekked for four days through the desert. Across the border in Chad, she found sanctuary in the town of Tin. Thousands of her neighbours were already there when she arrived.  As Kaltuma tells her story, a crowd gathers to corroborate it. Osman Nurrudin Sadr says his whole family was killed. Khadija Yacob Abdallah, a pretty 17-year-old, watched her parents die and was then gang-raped. All the refugees offer the same explanation. They want to kill us because we are black, says one.       If you cannot already suppose from key words like "Across the border in Chad", this horror in happening in the Sudan, Africa's largest country by landmass. I suppose you were expecting me to say something incredibly suprising, like the USA or France or the UK or some first world nation. The reason I withheld the name is to demonstrate the popular ignorance of this atrocity. No one seems to realize not only the magnitude of whats going on, but the fact that something is happening at all.   Sudan is currently in the midst of not one, but two civil wars. One has been raging intermittently since the country gained its independence in 1956. In Sudan, the north is predominantly muslim and Arabic, while the south is mostly black africans, who are animist with a very small minority of Christians. When independence came, southerners demanded autonomy and were ignored. So they rebelled. Between 1972 and 1983 a peace was actually maintained, but for the past nineteen years war has raged. The goverment in Khartoum, dominated by a Muslim Arabic elite, has enganged in scorched earth tactics - razing entire villages to the ground for suspected rebel sympathies, and encouraging raids and the slave trade in the south.   Foreign influence, especially American pressure, has encouraged Goverment negotiation  with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the main rebel group. Talks have been tortuous, but finally some agreements have been hammered out. The biggest debate is for the petrodollars coming from the oil rich regions in the south, a major reason why the north is so loathe to let the south go. A deal on how to split revenues and map laying out the the path for the withdrawl of northern troops have been reached this year. For an interim period of six years, the current President Omar al-Bashir will remain president and John Garang, leader of the SPLA, will be his deputy. After six years, the south will have a final vote on whether to secede or not. Worries over the North simply biding its time to reassert its dominance and because no agreement has been agreed, let alone touched upon, about what will happen to the oil rich regions if secession is chosen - the goverment in Khartoum will surely not let those petrodollars slip away. The south itself is fairly divided. Still, a formal end to this war is expected to be announced later this year. George W Bush is widely seen as the architect of this peace - he may be more popular in the south of the sudan than anywhere on Earth. Or as one young warrior said while leaping into the air, brandishing a white barbie doll; "This is a new wife for President Bush. May God grant him many fertile women with firm bodies and an election victory without problems in Florida."  The other war is taking place in the West, and has been largely ignored for some time. Many groups feel left out by the peace between Khartoum and SPLA, as niether group are remotely representative or democratic. This has boiled over into outright war in the Dafur region. Two new rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), appeared in Dafur and managed a string of successes. The Goverment's response was quick and brutal - to quote the economist directly simply because I can not manage a way to restate this horror -   It unleashed the janjaweed. To swell the militia's ranks, Arab criminals were released from jail and given horses, $100 each and carte blanche to loot. (These ex-prisoners are labelled ta'ibeen,those who have repented.) The janjaweed have clattered into village after African village, torching the straw roofs of conical huts, killing young men who might join the rebels, raping women who might feed them, and stealing everything they can carry off. Sometimes they brand the hands of women they rape, to make the stigma permanent. They have also torched dozens of mosques and torn up and defecated on copies of the Koran. Whatever inspires them, it is not Islam. Their victims have no doubt that the janjaweed enjoy the state's blessing. When asked what gives them the right to stop blacks at road blocks, the militiamen reply: We are the government. When pillaging, they are often supported by the air force and by the regular army. First the planes come, then the janjaweed and finally government soldiers, says a refugee. They are brothers united on a mission to kill.    The rainy season is arriving, and soon all ability to reach these refugees will be nil. Ten thousand more streamed over the border, but the UN classified them as combatants even though it is mostly women, children, and the elderly - because it can not handle any more load. Vast swathes of fertile farmland have been burned and depopulated of their non-Arab inhabitants - who are accused of harbouring rebels - by the Janjawid since August 2003, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). "With rare exceptions, the countryside is now emptied of its original Masalit and Fur inhabitants," said the watchdog in a campaign entitled "Help end ethnic cleansing in Darfur" launched on 7 May. Anything that could sustain life - food, livestock, wells, blankets and clothing - had been looted or destroyed. "Villages have been torched, not randomly, but systematically - often not once, but twice. "Most of the displaced, who number over one million, have been forced into urban areas, where they remain virtual prisoners, as they are vulnerable to attack if they leave the settlements, according to a US Agency for International Development (USAID) emergency fact sheet dated 14 May. Unable to return to their farms to cultivate, they are missing the annual planting season, which ends in late May or early June when the rains begin. The consequences of no harvest next November, plus the limited capacity of aid agencies to operate in Darfur, could be catastrophic, say humanitarian workers. Roger Winter, the USAID assistant director, predicted this month that once the rainy season begins, 30 percent of the affected population could die over the next nine months. The UN has increased its estimate of conflict-affected people in Darfur from 1.1 million in April to two million this month.Charity organizations are under just as much threat from attack as the rebels themselves.

       Whoa. Its been a while.   I know it was cruel of me to leave you dear readers without your daily Tyson fix - that the shock sent you into withdrawl not too unsimilar from that of a heroin addict. But there was no other option. I needed to feel like I was working and/or studying.   But now all my APs are over, as are my interviews for the OHP. I still need to write the damned thing, but the hard part is over. As for my APs, they were mostly blah. None of them were too hard, even World History. The annoying thing on that one is that the DBQ asked my what other documents would be useful. WHAT THE HELL! They're supposed to be proving me with documents to answer the fucking question - thats why it is called a Document Based Question! Don't be lazy and pretend that there is not many documents relating to Pre and Post 520 CE Tang China, because I know theres more than six! Lazy shits, all of you. The real suprise, however, was my Latin AP. What was supposed to kill me only mildly molested me, and even took me to dinner and a movie. Came completely out of left field. What didn't though, was  Troy . What a shitty shitty movie. Only Jackson is apparently capable of putting together a successful epic.   I do have one more thing to say related to school work. My Oral History Project, or OHP, kind of hit a brick wall - I had no one to interview and it was due monday. I was freaking out, and I kept trying to call the local chapter of the NAACP but they wouldn't answer. My only other option was just waltzing into some Retirement Village and harassing old people for info about whatever. But I had a lucky break this morning - I saw that in Topeka, there was a massive NAACP convention celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Brown vs Board of Education. I wanted to do Civil Rights, as that was also my term paper. So I quickly siezed the oppurtunity (after wasting as much time as I could pleading for other people to join me on my whirlwind and presumably zany adventure to far-off Topeka), bought a micro cassete recorder, and drove to Topeka. After eating next-door to the hotel at a traditional traveling Carnival, I went in and spent roughly 45 minutes building up enough courage to talk to anyone. Finally, I approach two women, and then an eighty year old minister. I even got to meet Jesse Jackson along the way. Sweet ass! I'm still seeing if theres any possible of getting to interview him as the minister knew him fairly well, but somehow I doubt it.  One more bit of info. Yale sent me an email demanding money for their program - their little way of telling me that I've been accepted. Holy crap. I'm going to be spending ten weeks in New Haven learning Arabic. No summer for Tyson - it begins May 31st, roughly two days after school ends. I'll be there until August 6th. People are questoning my sanity for embarking on such a course, and I am as well - but I'm a little excited in a bizarre way. I am depressed that I won't be spending any time with my friends, and that I'll get to go through the typical "Tyson is in a new situation" game I've come to know and love every summer. You see kids, whenever I'm thrown into one of these camps, I typically make an ass out of myself as soon as possible. Its unavoidable - hey, I know I'm rough around the edges. Quite suddenly I become the person everyone hates. Its not really that bad - one gets used to it. I'm not too worried about it as it will give me plenty of time to be alone and think this summer. I'm faintly looking foward to the imposed social isolation - more time for much needed introspection into the nature of my self, no worries about whether I'm doing enough with people, no nothing. I forsee a summer where I will be somewhat depressed and invariably amused and I have no problem with that. Beside, I really do want to learn Arabic - for future plans I can speak little of.   Summer of my Junior year..Junior year is over. I'm going to be a senior. Its astounding. I remember turning to Hunt Bascom like the first week of my freshmen year during lunch and going "Hunt! When the hell did we get into High School?!" And here I am, reaching the final year of it. I'm not sad - Junior year was a good year. There was ups and downs - nothing special. I grew to know and love many more people than I did before, which is always a good thing according to some people. I wonder if this is how I will feel on my death bed. But thats assuming I will have one.   I'm not in the mood to post anything but superficialities, as I'm still debating the nature of my character. If one really wants to know me, read  In the Lake of the Woods . We read it this year as out last book in english - fairly quick read, excellent novel. O'Brien essentially throws into disregard the fundermentality of the modern novel. The part that frightens me so much is how so much of it hit close to home, how much of it I identified with. If you read it, you will understand. Off to more important things.   Boring, yet Important   As strange as it may seems, the last three weeks have been a great victory for Democracy. Not democracy as in the free world, but Democracy as in the platonic form, the abstract concept. India has finally tallied up the votes in its recent election, in which nearly half a billion people voted.  Roughly 400 million of India's 670 million eligible voters participated in this national election - which is actually a low turn out for India. There was also a record low in voting related deaths - only 48! One must find a victory where one can in the world's largest democracy.  The formerly ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was certainly looking for one. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called these elections six months early - a move that has most certainly backfired and amounted to near poltical suicide. His advsisors convinced him to ride off the soaring economic growth India was experiencing (an astounding 8%!), good monsoon season, and the fairly successful new peace inititave with Pakistan. Emboldened by a good showing in the state elections last December, he agreed. But in what supposedly should have been a fairly solid victoy, BJP lost more than 40 of its 182 seats in the lower house - enough so that BJP and its allies no longer form the majority. The major opposition party, Congress, having finally conceded to the needs for allies and coaliton goverments, now holds the majority. This is a stunning victory for Congress, and its leader Sonia Gandhi. Congress has apparently won on the back of the silent majority, which in India is made of the extreme poor. Nearly one half of India's one billion people still live on less than one dollar a day, have poor fresh water access, little sanitation, and couldn't care less about the latest call centers. They have seen little of the supposed rewards from India's economic prosperity and demand change. Read more about the election at my favorite  urlLink source .  Mrs. Gandhi, born in Italy, is a member of a massive political dynasty. She is the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru who had taken over as leader of Congress from Mahatma Gandhi. Her former husband was Rajiv Gandhi, Indias prime minister from 1984 until his assassination in 1989. Before Rajiv, his mother, Indira Gandhi, ruled the country for majority of the time since the mid-60s. Sonia and Rajiv's son, Rahul Gandhi, has also recently entered the family business, doing very well in the state elections in December in Uttar Pradesh for Congress where he ran. And after some mulling and debate, she  urlLink will be the country's next prime minister .   As for what this means for India is anyone's guess. Congress is part of a leftist coalition that includes substantial Communist parties. A broad coalition is unlikely to prove too radical, but also too stable as well. Congress is stated as supporting continuing India's economic growth, and therein lies a major question. The great success of Mr. Vajpayee and the BJP has been the dismantling and reform of India's clumsy and stagnating socialist system that has held it behind for so many years. State industries are being privatised, and the fiscal deficit is being decreased, and competion is being fostered. It seems like it may be against Party and leftist principle for the Congress led coaliton to continue these programs, and stock markets have already sank in the anticipation that economic reform will halt. Yet even long time Communists are capable of compromise - in the state of West Bengal, a communist dominated state for fifty years despite relentless economic stagnation, the Communist Party has taken a move that would shock most rightist govements. It has classified information technology and related services as public utilities. Strikes are banned. All in the name of economic progress. Hopefully, more attention paid to the impovershied aspects of India seeking their own fortune should encourage reform rather than stunt it.   As for the rest of the world, a whole other question is opened. There has been political consensus around the peace with Pakistan so that at least can fortunately expected to continue. One interesting outcome may be in the form of Israel. BJP had a pro-Israel stance and was persuing strategic relations with Tel Aviv. Congress, along with its many muslim supporters and other Indian circles, were not nearly as interested in that idea. It is unlikely that relations with be severed, but not tightened either. Congress also has held a fairly ambivalent stance towards the USA, which can range from accepting to scorn. In the past it has voice distrust in American interests in India. The Communist Party of India or CPI (not to be confused with the other communist party, Communist Party of India Marxist or CPI-M) has rumbled that the Pro-U.S. foreign policy of the BJP be scrapped immediately upon the takeover of the Congress led coalition. Little has been heard from Washington, which is much to busy with Iraq and the prisoner mess to focus on India at the moment.   Sonia Gandhi is claiming "I will change India". Lets hope for better and not worse, but frankly I'm not so sure.   Update  Sonia Gandhi has now suprisingly declined the position of Prime Minister. In a tearful announcement to a shocked Congress, she said she decided it was the best way to protect Congress from attacks on her Italian origin. MPs from Congress pleaded with her to change her decision, but she remain firm. Markets have taken an upswing to the announcement, and to the fact that Manmohan Singh, architect of India's modern economic reforms, may become Prime Minister instead. Read more  urlLink here .

Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said this week that the govermnt would start giving cash bonuses to women for having more babies. Every baby born after June 30 will net its mother $2,000. The new incentive was unveiled in an election year budget that Australian papers have dubbed the "erection budget." Costello said the measure is neccessary to ensure that Australia will continue to produce enough taxpayers to support the aging population. "You go home and do your patriotic duty tonight," he told reporters. Costello, a father of three, said three was the ideal number of kids: "One for your husband, one for your wife, and one for your country."  That last one makes me wish I could find a girl as 'patriotic' as me. Ah, the fevered dream of a madman. I'm coughing up a storm, so I'm off to hopefully get less sick and to write an OHP.

       You dog, you Sam. But thats enough of that.  Children, children - theres no need to fight over my love. I have enough for everyone, except for Jesse. Loser.   I'm hoping that by dallying here, I can waste time and not study for my APs. It appears to be working. I simply cannot believe that we have already arrived at the end point of my Junior Year. An entire year's worth of labor will now be put to the test, to find whether I have the mettle to back up my boasts and submit these tests to my will. Actually there is an exception to that statement - World History. I've minimally studied for it, but I did not take the class. But I have failed and fallen in so many other areas this year - I am left with only one chance at redemption, even if in only my own eyes.   Hmm, my eyes. I like the phrase, because its fitting to my particular mood. I've drifted into one of my more jaded, somewhat disappointed, ambivalent states. Did you know that movies and TV are evil? They allow you to believe incredible fantasy and impossibility to be just that, possible. They foster the superhero, everything will turn all right in the end mentality. But beyond that, they allow total immersation and observation without interaction! It describes me right now. I'm constantly wallowing between the extremes of "I am the only one who actually exists" to "Everyone but me exists." It's easy to take that the wrong, 'look-at-me-I'm-a-lost-goth-girl-who-is-in-an-identity-crisis' sort of meaning out of that. But I don't feel bad, or lost, or any less me. I just don't quite realize my own effect on other people and on reality itself - I feel like the cameraman in the movies, following and watching - not more than that. I'm not depressed, just insular I suppose. A mere analysis of how I feel currently, certain to rebound to hubris and narcissism in good time. Perhaps thats why I find it hilarious that I can be considered a good judge of character and a decent person.   Actually, that last part has nothing to do with that. I am a decent person in most senses of the word. I feel confident in many of my abilities, and totally inadequate in those I consider important only because I fail at them, but such is the same in others.  I just don't feel decent. I can't bring myself to consider myself a good person - at best a coldly indifferent one. I feel constantly wracked with the need for vengence for something that really hasn't been committed against me - essentially, I'm always an angry, poor sport. Sometimes I'm genuinely frightened by my wreckless and selfish misanthropy, other times I blow it off by dismissing it as mere teenage agnst and what-not. But every time I do that I remember the people I have been a dick too, much to my own pleasure, the people who I have acted against and hurt. I become flooded with guilt, but more pertinently, a small thrill - as if I'm willing myself to want to enjoy it all. I've been totally corrupted by cartoons and comic books - I almost want to be a supervillain. Luckily, such delusions are merely that - fantasy. But unluckily, I may be a shining example of a proto-psychopath with the possibility of a full blown neurosis. You see, pyschopaths  aren't   insane. Thats a popular misconception. Pyschopaths are "are not disoriented or out of touch with reality, nor do they experience the delusions, hallucinations, or intense subjective distress that characterize most other mental disorders. Unlike psychotic individuals, psychopaths are rational and aware of what they are doing and why. Their behavior is the result of choice, freely exercised.  Psychopaths are guided by such a different thought process than non-psychopathic humans, we tend to find their behavior inexplicable. But they're actually much easier to predict than the rest of us once you understand them. Psychopaths follow much stricter behavior patterns than the rest of us because they are unfettered by conscience, living solely for their own aggrandizement. None of his victims means anything to the psychopath. He recognizes other people only as means to obtain what he desires. Not only does he feel no guilt for destroying their lives, he doesn't grasp what they feel. The truly hard-core psychopath doesn't quite comprehend emotions like love or hate or fear, because he has never experienced them directly." to steal from the Columbine article I previously linked to. Look how the leader, Harris, is described:   "He is disgusted with the morons around him. These are not the rantings of an angry young man, picked on by jocks until he's not going to take it anymore. These are the rantings of someone with a messianic-grade superiority complex, out to punish the entire human race for its appalling inferiority. It may look like hate, but "It's more about demeaning other people," Harris claimed to lie to protect himself, but that appears to be something of a lie as well. He lied for pleasure, Fuselier says. "Duping delight"?psychologist Paul Ekman's term?represents a key characteristic of the psychopathic profile. Harris married his deceitfulness with a total lack of remorse or empathy?another distinctive quality of the psychopath. Fuselier was finally convinced of his diagnosis when he read Harris' response to being punished after being caught breaking into a van. Klebold and Harris had avoided prosecution for the robbery by participating in a "diversion program" that involved counseling and community service. Both killers feigned regret to obtain an early release, but Harris had relished the opportunity to perform. He wrote an ingratiating letter to his victim offering empathy, rather than just apologies. Fuselier remembers that it was packed with statements like Jeez, I understand now how you feel and I understand what this did to you. "But he wrote that strictly for effect," Fuselier said. "That was complete manipulation. Harris' pattern of grandiosity, glibness, contempt, lack of empathy, and superiority read like the bullet points on Hare's Psychopathy Checklist and convinced Fuselier and the other leading psychiatrists close to the case that Harris was a psychopath.  "  Interesting stuff - interesting enough for me to bring it back up. Does it apply to me? I don't know. I'm not homicidal, but the manipulation, arrogance, lack of empathy can certainly be found within me. Interesting enough for me to mull on this. Perhaps I should go back into my studies in self-hypnosis to deal with this matter. I'm probably just jealous and feeling the pangs of my romantic and possibly sexual virginity harder than ever right now. Whatever. Now I have to go worry about APs and college. Oy vey. But not before I complete my new additions   Boring, yet Important   Once I again, I only have the will to post news lite - but it's important none-the-less! Twenty-five baby, twenty-five big ones. No one has turned twenty five, but the European Union is now comprised of twenty five members. Ten new nations, mostly Eastern European, have been added to the previously fifteen country bloc in emotional, patriotic orgasms throughout all of Europe. The sheer brilliance in choosing May Day - the international worker's day cannot be understated, if only for its kitchy value. On what was traditionally a day of forced jovialness, endless military parades, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, roughly seventy-five million people have entered one of the most boringly exciting if not particuarly useful political organizations to exist. For a general description, go  urlLink here. This is the largest expansion in the European Union's history - it is now comprised of 455 million people, and has had its territory increased by twenty-five percent - yet its gross domestic product grew by just five percent. Therein lies the difficulty ahead for the Union. The true importance lies not in the size of the increase, but the fact that eight of the ten new members were formally communist - three of them actually previously were incoroporated in the Soviet Union - and in the wealth disparity between the old and new.  The outlook is not entirely rosy - average GDP per head in the ten new countries is only 46% of the previous Euro average - Latvia, the poorest new member, has a GDP per head of only 36%. Forecasts by the Economist Intelligence Unit say it will take Poland 59 years to catch up with the European average. Headaches abound when confronted by this in the Union Center of Brussels. But that is not all. The European Union itself is undergoing a phase of exceptional unpopularity. Polls have shown that member country support for the Union has fallen sharply below 50%. Spanish and Greek voters have thrown out their old goverments; Germany and France have suffered humiliating setbacks in regional elections. Blair is under constant flack now in Britain, as is Berscoullini in Italy. Any news eminating from Brussels is vitorolically derided. Brussels itself is a seat of bitter controversey - the drafting the constitution is in a near lockdown, big and small countries are at lodgerheads of how to decide voting weights, and the former Franco-German driving engine of Europe is now widely resented. The EU institutions, such as the executive European Commision and the legislative European Council and the European Parliament are ill-prepared for the influx of so many countries, people, and languanges.  Poor economic growth can be cited as the major factor for this discontent. The average growth in Germany, France, and Italy has averaged at a mere 1.6%. Unemployment remains high: 9.3% in Germany, 9.4% in France, 11.2% in Spain. Many countries that pay heavily into the EU, such as Germany and the Netherlands, worry they will now have to give more, while those who currently benefit the most, such as Spain and Portugal, fear their cash will now be siphoned eastward. But an even more sensitive issue is prevalent - migration. Newspapers across the EU have run terrified nativist propaganda about being swamped by immigrants from East and Central Europe. It is a sign of the times that most of the EU15 have taken advantage of transitional rules to erect temporary barriers to the free movements of people from the ten new countries - even though in the long run they need more immigrants, not less.   In fact, the actions of the current member countries of the EU can be put to blame for the less than stellar economic revival in Europe. The three largest euro-area economies - Germany, France, Italy - all only play lipservice to the need for change. Despite Frances announces reforms in health care finance and new tax cuts, and Germany's watered down Agenda 2010 for reforms to pensions, welfare benefits, and labor markets, reform has been entirely too modest. Yet even those have been met by voter resistance, and there appears to be hope for change in the climate. Thanks in part to the European Central Bank's tight monetary policy, the fiscal-policy restictions of the stability pact, and their own failure to implement reforms the biggest European economies are stuck in sluggish growth and in the midst of a viscious cycle - slow growth means high unemployment, which means little support for reform, which means slower growth. But the ten new countries could actually help in that regard. They are growing faster than the current members - quite possible for them to be the jumpstart Europe needs. Having lived under a central planned economy, many of them are, on the whole, more liberal economically. There is the risk that membership could force more regulation, but as it stands, there is a general leaning in favor of low taxes, smaller welfare systems, and more competition. It is in the economy that the EU needs to show more ambition, instead of granstanding in the field of foreign affairs. Now that the EU is comprised of both Rumsfeld's "Old" and "New" Europe, polarization is an increasing possibility. Foreign and Security policy set up with a rivalry to the United States in mind a successful doctrine does not make. Where it should focus is in its most successful sphere - expanding the club, especially Turkey.  Its hard to imagine that what is now the European Union started as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 with only six members - Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxemborg - with a primary emphasis on Franco-German reconciliation. Now is the time of trial for the EU. It has not proved itself as a competing model to the USA to the rest of the world, nor has it proved itself as an effective rival to the rest of the world as the USA. It should be noted that the USA and the EU are not and shoul not be competin, but this is merely from a global viewpoint. Perhaps soon the EU can be taken seriously.  Much thanks goes to the Economist where I liberally lifted most of this information/sentences. God Bless the Economist.

        Major Edit: The use of a "not", or lackthereof, can completely change the author's e tone. Whoopsy. Thus, the conflict we should have entered is now the one we should not have entered.    I said I would do it, so here it goes. Today is a day for:   Boring, Yet Important   Or Why Kerry is Shitfucked   Unless you're not not in the vincity of a television or without access to the internet (a truly strange circumstance for you to be reading this) you have probably heard that that Iraqi sovereignty has been  urlLink handed over  two days before the June 30th deadline. The current administration, notoriously fond of pre-emption, has tried to jump ahead of insurgents who would have used the well known date for "spectacular blood baths". Which is a reasonable assumption, seeing as violence has escalated to high levels in the past few days. Any attacks on the 30th now should be slightly less meaningful and symbolic. After signing the papers, US Proconsul Paul Bremer was on a C-130 flying out of Iraq in less than an hour.   Now when we say handed over, we of course mean restored up to a point. None of this is a huge suprise, as this goverment is merely yet another interim goverment to prepare for the final preparations of preparing to create a duly elected and stable Iraqi democracy. The number one priority, and the goal that will affect all other decisions, is of course attempts to create some semblance of stability in Iraq. There are some vague signs of increasing Iraqi frustration with the foreign meddling and murdering of the insurgents as well, so Allawi may have a base to launch hardy measures against them.   These are all basic, undetailed facts - hardly informative. One may ask, what the hell this has to do with Kerry at all. Iraq only has roughly 8,000 'troops' and 40,000 poorly trained National Guard. It's security forces are yet to be intergrated, and local tough men are seeking to carve out their own power bases. NATO has only agreed in theory to train Iraqi security forces, with no actual plans hammered out. This means, more than anything, Coalition forces must remain in Iraq. That much is also obvious. They even have a UN mandate for up into 2006. We cannot in good concience immediately withdrawl American Soldiers. By engaging in this conflict, we are committed to remain until the end. A sudden retreat would be even more damaging to Iraq; it would be seen as a sign of victory by the insurgents, lead to massive power struggle in a vacuum, quite possibly creating a humanitarian crisis of great proportions as the county divided among strictly drawn but hazy ethnic and religious lines. The most likely result would be the rise of regional strong men and Islamic fundementalists.  The Iran backed Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq could have a field day. Iran itself may even jump to prey on its now vulnerable nemisis. The US would lose not only its credibility, but would be seen as weak willed and cowardly, willing to let the world suffer in isolation, and to hole itself up far on the other side of the Atlantic. An already simmering anti-american mood sure to cause trouble for the US down the line would be able to turn into a blazing fire, as whatever rises above the ashes in Iraq would surely have little respect for the country that smashed everything and ran. The worst sufferers would be the Iraqi people; the death toll could well be catastrophic in the ensuring civil turmoil.  That is of course quite a doomsday scenario, but one that presets a point. American soldiers will have to continue fighting, and unfortunately, dieing to help forge a much more stable Iraq. It's our responsibility to the world, to the Iraqi people. Soldiers, sadly, die to protect civilians. It doesn't always have to be the case, but it is here. The Iraqis are everymuch civilians as American citizen, and to abandon Iraq would only aggravate the situation. It's seems clear, though who knows fifty years down the line, that this is a conflict we should not have fought, or at least fought in this style. But an inherent characteristic of a quagmire is it's ability to grasp and hold, and Iraq is doing just that. It cannot be ignored and pretended as if nothing ever happened. this has matured beyond thin ideals that this just a conflict about oil (especially as it was well known how much the Iraqi oil industry/capacity atrophied during the past decade and how hard it would be to restard before the war) and greed - it is a conflict that needs to be resolved, however painfully. To cut and run would be as selfish as any of those reasons for entering the war.  Once again, what the hell does this have to do with Kerry? Kerry and his advisors are far too intelligent to not realize the above. But with the election quickly becoming simply a referendum on Iraq, he is trapped. The non incumbent party typically has this problem, being deluded under conflicting views whose only similarites are in their anti-incumbency. Most of his 'supporter's' are not even voting for him; they are voting against Bush and what they see as his war. They know next to nothing about Kerry, and are sometimes openly hostile to him - to them, he's just the anti-bush button/chad on the ballot. Kerry has done little to help himself in this matter, so frequently refusing to come out solidly on issues or backtracking that even he probably doesn't know what he is for beyond winning the election. Kerry cannot possibly satisfy the demand that the troops be returned home. Bush doesn't have this problem. His campaign is quite comfortably acknowledging the further involvement of US troops, that things are getting better, and the UN involved. Kerry may say Bush is moving too late for what Kerry demanded, but that's hardly a forceful campaign. Claiming a pullout would likely gain him more recognition, cut away the gray area between him and Bush, and garner rabid support from the left. But what would happen when he could not follow up on the plan? Would he willingly sacrifice Iraq to it's fate for a campaign point? Not likely. So he is stuck with a position that a good portion of his (at least more vocal) supposed supporters cannot accept. The average american, while generally being more centrist than believed, would find it hard to support a man who could not come up with a firm, new idea on how to deal with the situation. Nixon promised a secret plan to win Vietnam that he couldn't reveal lest his rivals steal it and won, but he was going against McGovern - whom openly protested the war. The Bush administration already has a war winning plan, so they say, so that option is less appealing for Kerry to take.  But wait! Can't Kerry save himself on the other major issue of the election! Surely Kerry use the public's miasma about the economy to his advantage, whether or whether not that it appears to be growing again and that jobs are being created at 150,000-300,000 a month. The fact do not really matter in this case, because the public still feel that that the economy is in the shit tank. (Un)fortunately, it appears that Kerry has no idea how to campaign. As barren as the political wasteland is, here is what Kerry has come up with two weeks ago. A  urlLink seven dollar minimum wage . THE FUCKING SEVEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE! What the hell is he doing? Other than being obviously nothing more than a 'proven' vote getter, it's sending him straight in the wrong direction. Kerry and his advisors seem to believe that Bush is the new Reagan even more than Bush does. Bush is not an anti goverment conservative. Bush (much like Reagan secretly was) is all about big government policies and spending initatives. He may as well be one of the most liberal presidents since Rooselvelt, economically speaking.   Kerry cannot hope to confront Bush on this front. Bush's first campaign ads focused on No Child Left Behind and the Medicare precscription drug bill - each of which will expand Washington, and cost taxpayers untold billions. Kerry has been pre-empted on the spending front. Where else is Kerry left to confront Bush? On taxes.  This is not some bullshit  urlLink middle class tax cuts  (ie; specialized tax credits for good behavior). He needs to come full out and against the entire tax code.  The Bush campaign would be reeling from such a suprise move. Either they would have to defend the absurdities inherent in the system, or create their own tax overhaul package.  Gone are the days of  urlLink 'me-too Kerry' . Bush would finally have to react to him, not the other way around. Suddenly, Kerry's not proposing thing the administration already appears to be doing. They would have to radically change their tactics to adapt to such a move. Kerry could even keep his union patronage in the process, by calling for a transparent tax code where savings are exempt from taxation with an end to corporate subsidies and welfare on both the paying and recieving sides. You save it, you keep it. There's a motto people would rally behind. Kerry could even attract support for the upper income bracket, by promising to end the  urlLink alternative minimum tax . Worse come to worse, realizing we're talking about a campaign here, he could tell a little white lie to his unions, promising to tax corporate profits ruthlessly, with the hidden secret being that corporations don't pay taxes, individuals do - at least according to some.   It's not as if Bush could contest the actual revenues brought in by such an overhaul. His deficits have made that an invalid point. Kerry just needs to cut those up to claim a victory. It's not the best overall strategy, but he hasn't given too many options. It's time for him to differentiate himself on the issues, and actually obtain a base attracted to him and his policies, not to his being not-bush - much to shaky and double edged of a platform, and a failure of the democratic system.   That was fun. Most of the points, links, and even word choices/sentences were stolen from Reason.com. Ain't I a stinker? I say that so I can in good faith post this other  urlLink link  showing why John F. Kerry needs to re-invent himself taxwise in the guise of JFK, and why JFK was actually a supply side economist.   I promise I'll put up an emo post later.

       My first thought when I read that comment on if I wanted my 'mystique' explained was "That depends - do you have a C cup?".  My second thought was "Oh, so  that's  why I luck out with women"   But I'm glad someone is here. I'm not sure how I feel about Christyn using my chatterbox to pick up anonymous internet strangers. Might as well go for it though; his IP is owned by KCnet, a provider based out of North Kansas City. Ass is ass christyn. Does this make me like an internet Pimp? Sweet. I can die with one of my dreams having come true - pimping out teenage girls through the medium of the world wide web. If I can't get any, for reasons that are apparent, I can at least vicarously enjoy making sure other people do. Hah, I'm a tool.   Volunteered again today. We almost didn't make it, as they changed locations and we didn't know where. But we got there right when they started serving. It was nice.  God damnit - why do I keep ending up at Beta. Such a fucking pit. And why did I spend more time with the girl? She followed me, and we went all around New Haven. I took her to Beta because she wanted to go in that whole "Well we don't have to if you don't want to" I think she just wanted to see a frat house. But I can't allow anything to blossom. A summer fling with a girl I'm not interested in is not only deceptive, but cruel. But openly rejecting her is cruel. Why can't I basically be friendly and nice to her and nothing more. I simply do not want to become that sadistic asshole who hurts people again, and help drive another girl into depression. I want to be decent for once.  Whoa I'm emo.  At least I can find faith in a  urlLink real american hero.    I'm kind of annoyed with this random format. I liked it more when I did my big "Boring, yet important" political diatribes and news links. Made me feel important. I'll start doing that again when I have more time.

       Man, I tried to be random, but I must still lack the insightful; no sam-esque mystique and internet groupies for tyson. I can be just as interesting and witty as sam. Well, not really - but I can be waaaaaaay more emo. And isn't that what the people really want?   I need to stop giving sam all my good links on instant messenger, now if I post them here I'm a thief. Well played, Mr. Ryan, well played.  Not much is going on here. I volunteered at a soup kitchen today, which was cool I guess. Just for dinner. The staff there has some interesting characters. Like the fifty year old pudgy, pasty, short white head guy who has several raps like "Thugology" and "Mr. Bondsman". Not bad. He didn't get a callback to the Apollo last year, but he has some connections this year, so see him there. Or the construction worker on the staff who can speak six languages - farsi, arabic, french, spanish, hindi, english. He acted mostly as a bouncer as volunteer workers are too non confrontational to reject people who ask for seconds before everyone has been served once. A brawl almost broke out too. I'm planning on going two or three times a week I think. I need the hours and I need something to do. It should be cool. We actually worked through dinner today, so we got free food at the Buttery, which was nice, even though I wasn't hungry.  Spent more time with the girl - still not really interested.   I feel like I should be doing something more here, but I don't know what. But that's summer. Even a summer spent learning arabic.   Being part of a goverment bueracracy is like being in kindergarten. Jesus Christ.  urlLink Apology time  - soon they'll have nap and juice and graham cracker hour. All at taxpayer expense too. And you know they'll get the expensive fancy graham crackers, not the cheap store brand kind. Fucking greedy kilt wearing bastards. God I love parliament. The first thing to come out of anyone's mouth is not how stupid it is just on principle, but because their opponents would need much more time then alloted to properly apologize for misleading their government. We're excited when Cheny drops the f-bomb; they're amazed when a fist fight doesn't break out.

       I'm bored.  Weather is gorgeous; but can't think of something to do outside.  I should work out more, but I emphasize the words "should" and "more".  Maybe I could do my homework in the afternoons, and not skip breakfast and a morning shower to do it.   That's crazy talk - you crazy.   On the plus side, I know a lot more about tax law and the ins and outs of a  urlLink 1023  form than I did a few days ago. Now to just make KC area business see things my way. (Hah, linking directly to a pdf file. What a rascal)  I miss  urlLink home .   And, continuing a trend, I  urlLink fear money . Funny thing is, the Germans tried the same thing with the Pound.  Gotta eat sometime.

       Ladysmith Mambazo was fantastic, if incredibly lonely, as no one would go with me. Oh well. I didn't really mind after I eventually found a spot on a bench so I could sit down and watch the show.  I need to get back to studying for a massive test I have in roughly nine hours and ten minutes. It will be the first time we will have to do arabic to english and vice versa translations - complete sentences at that.  But as I got some more studyin' coke from the machine, it gave me a quarter (fucking expensive Yale coke) as change. But this was no ordinary quarter. This was a  state  quarter. Arkansas, to be precise. This is the most fucked up lsd inspired currency I have seen - not counting all them foriegn "funny money". The back of the quarter is so crammed with random shit that I can barely fathom what the hell is going on. Front and center is a giant floating cut diamond. Beneath the diamond is a forest of what might be evergreen trees on the bank of a river. A godzilla sized duck is flying above the river to the right, while on the left is a massive weed stalk that appears to be some mixture of marijuana and wheat:     Now  urlLink they   have a logical and clear explantation for it; but to the uneducated masses that will use it everyday it appears Norman Rockwell and Andy Warhol collectively defecated on the mold in back of the US mint. You would think that a state with such image problems as Arkansas would take this as an oppurtunity for some good PR, like  urlLink Alabama.  They tell us to forget the gun totin' red necks and a legacy of bigotry well into the modern era by urging us to remember what's really important - Helen Keller and her amazing accomplishment; and how one woman's trials and tribulation and abilty to overcome despite the odds makes up for one state's shortcomings.  This coming from a guy from Kansas.  Shit I can't believe I wasted this much time on this. I need to study. Back to work.

       Note:  Saturdays are boring, until about 10:00 pm. Crappy dances can be fun if you make them at least.   Beta house is and always will be a pit. And yet I ended up there twice tonight. Beer pong is a fun game to watch.  Bad Fish, despite being a tribute to Sublime, does one hell of a show. Great concert. Even though the people I was with ditched me. Still a damn good show. Found other people. Just because theres a bouncer and the place says 18+ and that they check id doesn't mean that they do. They only really do that in the 21+ section - and sneaking past the guy between the sections is remarkably easy.  I need to sleep, and study the hell out of tomorrow. And then see Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Gonna be great.

       I'm fucking sweating like a fat kid in dodgeball right now - wait, scratch that. I've been the fat kid and dodgeball and let me tell you I'm sweating more than that. I'm fucking sweating cats and dogs. I am quite literally shoving felines and canines out the ying yang through my pores, like some redneck earth goddess squatting out the next batch kicking and screaming into the world.  I'm hoping because I think it's hot as hell, but maybe I have a stress fever, which would be cool if only for the lack of stress. I'm under so little stress I don't know what to do, except for the increasing difficulty of Arabic with TA's who really may have problems teaching, and for my own imperative that I need to work out more which I still ignore. Maybe I am under some self imposed stresss that I'm only acknowledging out of my search for something to do and need to feel important enough to affected by something if anything and then so I can complain and be sure thatg I'm still alive because I'm loathing a portion of it. No, thats not true. I'm just loathing the portion of it that doesn't have to do with me, and forcing me to loathe all parts of it. What? I'm rambling, but the backspace key for weaklings. Though i just used it right now to fix a spelling error. There I did it again. Huh.   What the fuck are you bitching about boy? You got nothing better to do? You're just starved for human interaction because you locked yourself out for four hours to finish Catch 22, which is a brilliant book by the way, but everyone already knew that so why focus on that. The Outlaw Sea was also quite good for people interested in such banal subjects, though it sometimes becomes little more than inspired anecdotes at parts. Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar looks to be quite good too - maybe this will last me more than a week.  You know why you finish books so fast? BECAUSE YOU DON'T LEAVE YOUR ROOM!   That's not true. I just left my room a minute ago!  To get a god damned cup! To get a cup so you could go to the ice machine and drink this box of coke cans you got for free all nice and cold. Whoope de shit!   I have plenty of friends here, you self righteous prick. I'm not fucking lonely or starved for attention. I know exactly where to go when I want to hang out with people. Well, that last parts not true, as I often find myself with no place to go, but when I do the people are cool and I'm making friends and blah and blah so shut the crap up. That's not the issue here! I'm fairly comfortable with my situation here.  Then what is the problem you moron! You nearly cried because in that brief period when you went out someone tried to im you and when you came back you tried back but they were gone! You've essentially convinced yourself you're in love with someone just to make yourself feel better and give you something to think about. Don't go condemning people to perfection.  I was being melodramatic you stupid cock! Jesus christ, just leave me alone. All I need to do is satisfy my worry that I'm not doing enough and then I can go straight back to not doing anything. And don't throw around the l word - people will get the wrong idea. I have no romantic feelings for anyone here, and that will remain that way. I can muse all I want on others if I want. Things to do are things to do, damnit!  You should study more for class.  Fuck class.  Meh, might as well.   Read  urlLink this  and stay informed.  Read  urlLink this  and laugh.  Read  urlLink this , push aside the possible illegalities of the conflict for a short while, think about the people actually suffering, and debate whether compromise/realism is failure.

       New York City is fun, and only an hour and a half train ride away. That sentence describes my saturday. Nothing amazing, but I love simply walking around the city. That and helping find crappuy fake IDs for kids in Chinatown (for the low low price of only forty five dollars!). Got my mom a gift too.  Studying for Arabic tests, which occur every monday, is not fun though. That is why I'm posting here, in a deliberate effort to waste time and do something else. I really need to begin studying  before  nine pm.  No more english in class is also frightening.   But I cannot dally too long, as I will not allow myself to outwit myself so obviously. No, I must cunningly divert my attention through a whole multitude of semi involved activities that each take a little time, not one that takes alot. The point appears to go to me this round, eh me! I'm a tricky one, thats for sure.  And for god's sake, someone cheer up Christyn. I can't be out emoed on my own blog, now can I? Make the poor girl smile, or some show other facial expression for the more daring/risque of you thrill seekers.   Thats all you get for now. Wasn't it so not worth an update?

       Note:  A one hundred foot category five ethernet cable can be wrapped and woven in such a fashion that it becomes a fifteen foot quadruple/quintuple ply rope. This rope is more than strong enough to support my weight, and suitable for hanging and rappeling down walls.   New Haven of all places can be somewhat boring. But thats what I get for sleeping well into the afternoon and being left alone. Arabic is cool. So are hobos with tourettes. And being taken for an adventuresome spontaneous guy who is perfectly comfortable and adapted to the city enviroment.   Girl problems of the atypical sort are incredibly suprising and not cool though.   Tired, so very tired.

        Fucking hell.  I had a nice long post typed out, and this fucking laptop froze. Now I have to redo all of this shit. Fucking technology. Compaq, owned by Hewlett-Packard, from room J32 Saybrook College I stab at thee!  So where was I before I was so rudely interrupted. Things are going well enough here - class is picking up the pace, but I think I'm actually getting it now. We're actually having fun in class, which is cool. Morning classes have really made me appreciate how delicious responsibility free weekends are. All this time to laze around, hang out, read, and break into parts of Yale. Pretty fucking sweet. Despite all that free time, I still haven't unpacked, although I did go to the "Family Dollar" to get some coat hangers and bounce. I'll get aroud to it by week eight. Then I'll finally wash my clothes.  Sooo much Pocky.  Other than that, not much has been going on. Other than one massive in the works plan whose very legality forces me to remain mum if it actually goes through. Which it won't, knowing me. But I did finish  The Confusion  by Neal Stepheson, the second novel in the Baroque Cycle trilogy, which is in turn linked Stephenson's earlier tome  The Cryptonomicron . Fucking brilliant books, every one. These are without a doubt some of my, if not absolutely, my favorite novels. It's hard to explain, and you may need to read them - which can seem like quite an undertaking, as none of them clocks in under eight hundred pages. But I never read a book that long where I was sad that it ended. Just look at the review of Confusion by Entertainment Weekly (Whom I will suspend criticism of out of my love of Stephenson); " [T]he definitive historical-sci-fi-epic-pirate-comedy-punk-love story. No easy feat, that.  Damn fucking straight. I can barely wait the four months for the end of the series,  The System of the World  to come out.  Luckily I have much to read and much to do in the meantime. William Langewiesche's  The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime , a survey and analysis of the international shipping industry, international regulation, and the oceans and shipping (along with the rise in nautical based piracy and the possibility of terrorism) as a whole, is turning out pretty well. I've made it about halfway through and reasonably satisfied.   But before we go into the boring world that I am so fascinated by, allow me a brief interlude. Recently, I had the 'chance' to converse online with the littlest Gorton (ie; Mandy's rising Freshman sister) and I'm still dumbfounded. Middleschoolers are bizzare, maybe this one especially so. She imed me, and asked me such questions on how long Mandy has been staying up, why I asked her to prom (continually claiming I dodged the question), whether she was mentioned in Mandy's diary, and how big my rims were. For my part, I told her a clown killed my father and repeatedly called her an idiot. Between her insanity and my beratings, she eventually told me I was being too mean and I must have problem if I need to put down people. At which point I, stuck, apologized sincerlely and then proceeded to calmly explain to her why she will never grow up to be anything more than a housewife. She then told me I didn't even know here  "fav color"  and signed off. Its a pretty funny log if anyone wants it. I took it as nothing more than screwing with another member of the Gorton clan, and indirectly screwing with Mandy. But Sam's advice was to "tap that, dawg" and I can't ignore that. Even Mandy, despite repeated claims to the contraty and lengthy forbidding, seems to encourage me;  nonexpes: She may very well hate you. Though I interpreted her hatred as repressed attraction. SwongaDamnit: hot SwongaDamnit: she must be soo attracted to me then.  Sweet. I can fulfill all my dreams and be the next Shane Combest - keeping those senior/freshman relations alive and well. Hah, I'm such a tool.   Boring, yet important   Today, for obvious reasons, will be very Reagan heavy. The controversey surrounding his presidency merits some looking into, as many claim him to be messiah while others the anti-christ. But the effect he has held on the modern american presidency since his administration, especially in economic policies, cannot be denied. I am neither Reaganaut nor Reagan-hater, but everyone should look a little more deeply into the matter.  -The Economist's brief  urlLink analysis  of Reagan and his administration. Fairly praising, but still fairly unbiased. Definitely not sycophantish. Worth a read. "Reagan, who died on Saturday June 5th aged 93, turned out to be one of the two or three most effective presidents of the past half-century; some would say the best of them all. Now the intellectuals can start musing about the hidden strengths that overcame all those too-evident weaknesses."  - urlLink Reagan as a liberal . What? Another interesting look.   -For those with enough patience to wade through dry economic data,  urlLink this  is breakdown of the tax policies of Kennedy and Reagan, and the Laffer curve in general. Heres an example:"The basic idea behind the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues is that changes in tax rates have two effects on revenues: the arithmetic effect and the economic effect. The arithmetic effect is simply that if tax rates are lowered, tax revenues (per dollar of tax base) will be lowered by the amount of the decrease in the rate. The reverse is true for an increase in tax rates. The economic effect, however, recognizes the positive impact that lower tax rates have on work, output, and employment--and thereby the tax base--by providing incentives to increase these activities. Raising tax rates has the opposite economic effect by penalizing participation in the taxed activities. The arithmetic effect always works in the opposite direction from the economic effect. Therefore, when the economic and the arithmetic effects of tax-rate changes are combined, the consequences of the change in tax rates on total tax revenues are no longer quite so obvious."  -Onto non-reagan material.  urlLink Here  is a briefing on the Iraqi Sovreignty Transfer for any confused or just ignorant, done by another one of my favorite magizines, The Week,   -The US is repositioning some of its troops from Germany and South Korea as part of a globa shift to do away with needless Cold War costs and deployments and to create much more flexible force. But this may stretch the already tenuous alliances and relationships with both countries; Germany opposed the war in Iraq, and many South Koreans believe that the US is needlessly antagonizing North Korea. Others fear that North Korea may see the withdrawl as tacit acceptance of its nuclear policies - that the US is backing down. Read more  urlLink here .  -Not political, but interesting. A  urlLink survey  on the etymological roots of phrases like "bee's knees" and "dressed to the nines". A sort of analysis of language.    Emma's Good News Journal   - Apparently, some Germans think they've found  urlLink atlantis . Those wacky krauts.  -The green dream of using just the Sun, wind and water for energy may only be a generation away on a large Swedish island, which hopes to do without any fossil fuels by 2025. Read more  urlLink here .   -Thousands of rain-soaked runners and walkers, many wearing bright pink T-shirts, braved the rain and chill yesterday and participated in the 15th annual Komen National Race for the Cure. More than 50,000 people registered for the five-kilometer race in downtown Washington, according to event organizers. They estimated about $2 million was collected for cancer research and treatment. Read more  urlLink here .  -I don't care that they may be forming shitty ass solo projects - progress is progress damnit, and  urlLink progress  is being made.   Thats all for now. I took three big breaks during writing this. See I do have friends.

       Note:  All fire 'egresses' and attendant alarms attached to doors at the rop of the the buildings here appear to be easily avoidable by  simply traveling through the ricket wooden walkways in the many attics.   The roof is obtainable through the utmost height of section 'O' which goes well beyond any sort of attic to a type of tower. This tower has several small windows that, along with some awkward groping on some nearby plumbing, serve perfectly well to launch out on part of the roof. Some more swinging takes you to a perfectly flat section that is quite high, and the fire escape doesn't appear to lead to the street but merely to a lower part of the complex - good to note in case of quick exits.  Drunk alumni, no matter how much you try to convince them, do not realize that you do not need to open the door between roof and tower when the window will simply do, as opening the door raises the alarm. Even when they have already come through the window  The girls up stairs have a really nice couch to sleep the night away on.  That is all.

       Update Two from Yale.  New Haven is either really hot or fucking freezing. It rains alot. I still haven't unpacked. Classes are really tough, but what did I expect. The professor wants us to study and do honework for six hours a day outside of class. We have weekly they exams, along with a midterm and a final. The weekly exams are two hours in length and I have one tomorrow. Sweet ass.   On the true plus side, I have sort of an excuse for never leaving my room, as I simply do not have the time. I only leave to eat or to go to class - all other times I'm either reading or studying in my room. I've made friends, but I only typically see them when eating.  But the people here are cool. The people in my class are too, but either they're over twenty or they don't live on campus - often both. I've gone around town, and it's ok. Maybe I'll have time to actually do shit on weekends, though it looks like I'm skipping the friday movie trip so I'll finally have time to unpack. An exciting friday night indeed. It's not so bad though. I'm getting alot of reading done, though I should probaby put it aside for more study time. The pace in class never lets up, and we won't be allowed to use english beyond the second week.  For some reason I'm been must jovially mift, which I don't really get. I just need to stop bothering people probably. This is a good time to end my annyoing habit of "Wow, you paid some small amount of attention to me so let me return the favor in a claustrophobia inducing frenzy TEN FOLD" I also should go to the gym, while I'm making a list of shit I'll never do. Thats the one thing I appreciate about the workload - an actual reason why I don't have time to work out, though I do have time to post here apparently.   I need to learn the harmonica - that'd be cool. Wow, I'm incredibly uninteresting. I'm going to say I was trying to be like George Orwell in  Animal Farm  and that I was writing in a deliberately simplistic and infantile style to emphasize the exciting monotony and the child like state you feel when learning an entirely new language. I must a genius of the highest caliber. Wait, I'm lying. I AM a genius of the highest caliber. Hah, silly me.   I don't have the time to waste with much more, though I'll probably still won't study. I'd thought I'd leave you with this  urlLink report , which is fitting for June 3rd. Tomorrow will be the fifteenth anniversay of the Tianamen Square Massacre in Beijing, where goverment troops opened fire on students protestors advocating democratic reforms, among other things. Today, the political opposition is al and fragmented. No one cares as long as the economy continues churning along at its unprecedented growth rate. Marx was right - who cares about the plight of the workers when instant gratification abounds. Its funny to see the world's largest communist nation bribe its population with loosening economic controls while ever tightening political ones (along with the irony that coorporations have found one the best places to exploit workers is the largest communist nation on earth). Of course that leaves a fairly large majority of the population on the outside - the rural farmers and countryside dwellers from whom Mao himself declared to b the true heart of the Revolution - in leiu of city dwellers. As we've seen in India, ignoring the rural poor can lead to no small amount of trouble. And in China, they can't vote and they only have one past precedent of making their voice heard.   Here are some other things to pass the time with:   urlLink A look at the situation in Saudi Arabi    A interesting  urlLink report  on what would be the best ways to spend additional resources helping developing countries. (I'll give you a hint, 'Kyoto' made the bottom of the list.)  A  urlLink detailed look  at the recent Libertarian Party Convention, for those interested.  A tory leader in Canada  urlLink paints the picture  of a truly conservative economic plan. And try and tell me that it ain't purty.    Emma's Good News Journal    - The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society released a  urlLink report  that finds overall observed cancer incidence rates dropped 0.5 percent per year from 1991 to 2001, while death rates from all cancers combined dropped 1.1 percent per year from 1993 to 2001.   Thats all for today. I guess I did have the time to waste on some of this.

       I went on a boat today!   It was the Amistad!   Hip hip hooray!   I even piloted it...ad.   Fuck. A god damn ABAB rhyme scheme poem. This little corner of the internet has sunk to new lows. I should just use this as a porn link site. I could do some real good.&nbsp; Though I thought that was what the boring yet importants were for. But I haven't done any of those, because even though I'm only in class from 9-12, I feel like I have no time to do anything. I'm always out of time. And I also am really tired of being here.   Oh well, just one more week. One more long, painful, lonely week. But it's not that bad. Grain of salt here people. I'm not in the mood to go into a long introspective rant, but I did find out something about me:   I'm not that conservative, I'm just an asshole! Anyone with stongly held political beliefs that I don't immediately agree&nbsp;with&nbsp;enrage me.&nbsp; Also, anyone who naturally&nbsp;thinks they're better than others, especially if they support that through the arguement of intelligence upsets me&nbsp;greatly. At lunch I was sitting next to some at heart liberals and&nbsp;some conservative minded douches. The douche&nbsp;never&nbsp;really said anything but lament&nbsp;the problems about being&nbsp;republican in the incredibly liberal north east, and how he always ends up in shouting&nbsp;matches with his mother becauses she's a "screaming liberal". Just his ability to&nbsp;dismiss&nbsp;the people across with&nbsp;an accepting&nbsp;knowledge that he's not some mindless republican drone that they must think he is, but an educated young man who&nbsp; is politically astute made me want to shout on why the current administration should be punished for the unwillingness to admit its own deception and mistakes over reasons to invade&nbsp;Iraq, how the new Medicare will end up costing the country just as much as an entrenched Welfare system with little more benefit,&nbsp;how ridiculous social policies are both&nbsp;fanning the flames of&nbsp;religious political war that shouldn't exist and&nbsp;in the long run hurting the economy&nbsp;and that merely pointing out Kerry's flaws is just a paper tiger of an arguement that fails to justify anything.&nbsp; Of course I realized that's entirely hypocritical of me, as I can be accused of the same thing. Thus, me=asshole! It's all so simple now. I can still be a Friedman Democrat on some levels! Also, the asshat insulted McCain. No one gets away with that. And what kind of excuse is "he's slippery"? Because he doesn't follow party line like a monkey? Sheesh.   But I did go on an Amistad cruise. I love the ocean, and I love ships. It's just so peaceful and exciting all at once. It wasn't the real amistad of course, but built in the spitting image.    urlLink Creepy .   urlLink Insane/Stupid. &nbsp;

       I'm getting really shitty about updating this. Maybe I should just complete transformation into random sentence of the day, ala' Sam and hundreds upon thousands of other examples. But I kinda like belonging to the group of holier than thou autodidact emo. That's just how cool I am. If I was a superhero, I'd be...     &nbsp; urlLink Him  or Spiderman; really basically the same, just with more ejaculating sticky white fluids from your arms. Hah, I'm twelve.   I haven't been doing much reading as of late, so not nearly as&nbsp;far as I want to be (eg: done) with the 9/11 Report, but the roughly over half of it I have read is very interesting. It began with the hijackings, which were rendered in enough detail, with transcripts of cell phone calls, the black box from United 93 which crashed in Pennsylvania, that it gave me chills. Terrible. It then goes onto to describe the immediate descisions made be the FAA and NORAD, which were for the most part too late or forgivably wrong. A large analysis is made on the intelligence gathering functions of every major federal law enforcement/intelligence agency, and their repeated failures to share information, along with a history since the seventies of why.&nbsp;Interspersed in all this is&nbsp;a detailed history of Al Qaeda, from it's origins in 1988,&nbsp; a survey of it's financial backing,&nbsp;its stay in the Sudan and&nbsp;its move to Afghanistan, the Clinton administration's actions and lackthereof against it, among other things. It's all quite fascinating.&nbsp;The sheer detail they go into when discussing the formation and execution&nbsp;of the&nbsp;"planes" plot &nbsp;is amazing, albiet heavily drawn from interrogations of captured Al-Qaeda members, which the report notes. The primarily 'detainee' source is the mastermind behind the plot, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.&nbsp; As of now,&nbsp; I'm at point describing the&nbsp;recruitment of the so called 'muscle hijackers' and their entrance into the United States.&nbsp; I recommend the read to anyone with the slightest bit of interest and whoever has the time.   I'm going to dinner now, and then I need to call American Airlines about pushing my flight a day back so I can go to Maine.    urlLink This  is interesting.   I might put up something more later tonight, though I don't know why I tell you that.

       My Chatterbox is a pit of vice and depravity.  I'm getting kind of lonely for no reason here. Maybe it's because this whole not interacting with the girl because I'm not naive enough to believe in immediately just being friends means I no longer have anyone to hang out with, as she's always around our old group and she needs them more. Kind of sucks not having anything to do though. Least I'm getting my homework done.  Went to the Elizabethan Club's rare book collection yesterday, pretty cool stuff. First folio shakespeare, corrospondence of Queen Elizabeth, and my personal favorite - a first edition of Paradise Lost with an amazing gold and green original hard cover. It dates from 1667.&nbsp; Funny how Cromwell's Puritan poet Milton&nbsp;doesn't get a&nbsp;publishing&nbsp;until&nbsp;the Restoration. Good literature transcends politics in this case. That and the fact that puritans were cheap as&nbsp;hell.  Apparently yesterday was the twentieth anniversary of the only robot related fatality in the US. Some poor schmuck got pinned up against a pole by the back of an industrial robot and he wasn't freed until he had gone into&nbsp;cardiac arrest. Died in the hospital five days later. Interesting. I wonder if Aibo would kill me if it had the chance.  Never use  urlLink hyperboles  with Plastic Surgeons. They professionally reshape the human body; don't give them the chance to feed their god complex.  &nbsp;

        Man    &nbsp; It's pretty boring here when you don't have anywhere to go, or anyone to hang out with. Oh well, she needs them more than me. I wonder if I'll get any more im freak outs tonight. Those are getting really fucking old.&nbsp; It's sad that I&nbsp;hope I dream about being home&nbsp;when I go to sleep. &nbsp; I'm bored and doing&nbsp;homework.&nbsp; Distract me. Please.&nbsp; I spent three and a half hours on&nbsp;a powerpoint about Baghdad last night. &nbsp;I should probably make even longer tonight. Who needs sleep? I don't, because I take afternoon naps.  &nbsp; Doopdy doo. Wish I was in Taiwan right now like my dad, brother, and sister. Lucky bastards. Especially with the increased political and military tensions in the area. Both China and the US have wargames going on the region. China is staging faux invasions on small&nbsp;islands in the straight. I wonder if you could see that - that would be pretty cool. I've gotten pretty into the whole China Taiwan situaton as of late,&nbsp; what with rumors of Reunification/Invasion by 2021 permeating through the Party, and the threat that China will invade if any attempt a declaration of independence is made on the part of Taiwan. And President Chen definitely is pro indepedence as well. Twenty three million people live in an economicaly vibrant healthy democracy in Taiwan., with US assurances of protection despite it's "One China" policy.&nbsp; There's a showdown I'm don't want to imagine. China has moved five hundred ballistic missles to the Fuijan province across the Strait from Taiwan, and has many more forces.&nbsp; The most hardline in the party call for invasion by 2008. New Chinese Military theory is also advocating surgical commando raids and decapitation strikes rather than flat out bombardment of the Island - hopefully to keep most of it in one piece and wage a modern campaign.&nbsp; But we see how well an emphasis on keeping troop counts low and shock and awe is working out in Iraq. Only two million more people live in Iraq.&nbsp; I wonder how the Taiwanese population would react to invasion - would there be the same ground swell of resistance as in Iraq? I would think so. And if the US gets involved, we're looking at a conflict of disastrous proportions. The new wargames, designed to create new surging method of projecting a quickly crescending force of 150,000 men and seven carrier strike groups, more or less as needed, in less than a month are hardly anything to be scoffed at. Maybe I'll devote a full Boring, yet Important to it. Just cause I say so. And I think it's interesting, and isn't that all that really matters. Not like I'm doing this for you. &nbsp; I'm gonna go back to being anxious and bored. &nbsp;

       sup chillun' .&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been a week since I updated, but you know, people get busy.  &nbsp;  Been quite a week too.  &nbsp;  Don't really know where to begin, but I will say I completely and utterly broke down Saturday night/Sunday Morning. I haven't cried for a looong time (well since the election actually, but I was/am a little&nbsp;girl about that, and not&nbsp;since&nbsp;a looooong time before that),&nbsp; let alone like that. It's all really hard to explain.&nbsp;To begin, like all contrived stories, it revolves around a girl. This is the new girl I was posting about.&nbsp; I let my cock get the better of me again, and started things up with her, even if somewhat less...hormonal.  &nbsp;  It's not as if the option was't there; in fact, it was more present then ever. In all my wildest fantasies, I couldn't ever imagine realistically I would be presented with what amounted to a willing sex slave, or even make the jump far enough that I would turn it down. I know&nbsp;a distinct part of me won't likely forgive that. But damnit, it wasn't right.  &nbsp;  Taking advantage of some emotionally broken girl who goes from relationship to relationship&nbsp;seeking meaning and wholeness in a viscious cycle that only leaves her more sad and empty is wrong. Rationalizing she will be unhappy either way after three weeks, so make these three weeks great for her, and get some action in the process is just that - rationalizing. She wanted it so bad she even pulled that one on me.&nbsp; At least this way I can&nbsp;help a girl onto the path of self respect and happiness; I know it's hardly assured but this way is much more likely than any other. And don't try any bullshit about me being afraid of a relationship, so I ran. How  classic ! If I played along, I was essentially offered free sex for three weeks, after which I could go home and not care about it any more. That's not a fucking relationship. That's also why I couldn't go through with it, and let her use me as a crutch to sink lower and lower.  &nbsp;  I was finally completely confused, and broken up over what to do.&nbsp; I spent a good few hours on the phone with a close friend whom I'm beginning to realize how much I miss (platonically damnit, don't read into things when you have plenty of other options) to try and figure out. Me an emotional matyr? When did this happen! But unfortunately, I had to realize the only healthy solution. No more. Not even cuddling, or holding, or anything like that. If my every touch is sexy and a turn on, then there can be none of it.  &nbsp;  I hate seeing girls cry. It's not right. The talk, which occured roughly twelve hours ago, was rough. She knew it was coming, and even wrote a story about it for her fiction writing class - funny thing is, since she was starting to worry that I would abandon her, I guessed thats what she was writing.&nbsp; When you wear your heart on your sleeve, you run the risk of being an open book. But Jesus, no one should have to suffer that, and I don't mean me but her. She agreed with me the entire time, which is one reason she knew it was coming, and also reluctantly admitted all of her excuses and rationalizations were just that. You can't always have what you want the most; I should know that. She actually broke up with her ninth(?) boyfriend ( she hasn't been single for a long period since she was thirteen) before all this, so she's 'alone' but with friends as I point out. She's so terrifed of being alone, she just can't handle it. She has to literally sleep with other people just to be comfortable enough to make it through the night. The only good thing about all this is maybe she'll use it as spring board to something better. I don't know, as that's awfully conceited of me. It ended amicably enough, and she very reluctantly agreed that she, and thus our little group of friends which she needs more than me, shouldn't see me for at least a week, if not for the next three.  &nbsp;  Of course this means after I came back from class, talking to some class mates about how one of my teachers was apparently  urlLink arrested  back&nbsp;in 2001 for 9/11, and gave a  urlLink testimony  in front of the senate Judiciary Comittee, who is also somewhat misogynistic and very passive aggressive - but this is a different story - she saw me, pulled me aside, and told me crying that one of the guys from our, my supposedly former, four/three people group won't talk to her anymore for driving me away. So now I have to find a way to deal with that. And do a powerpoint about Baghdad in Arabic by tomorrow. Shit me in a shit stick.&nbsp; It's never easy around here.  &nbsp; That's it for now

        Boring, Yet Important   I said I would get around to this, but not enthusiastic enough to actually write alot. Instead, here are some articles (links; make me look smart with a minimum of effort!):  - Another way Kerry could  urlLink learn from Kennedy . I already posted about Kennedy actually being a supply side economist, but this one tells Kerry to imitate Kennedy by almost disregarding the economy as the issue. 2004 is an election much like 1960, where an unknown senator from Massachusetts faced Richard Nixon, who had eight years of White House experience and the vice president of beloved War God Dwight Eisenhower (and unlike Gore, used his former boss). The economy was in trying to recover from recession, so Kennedy campaigned for the economy, right? Wrong. He took perhaps the harshest Republican Cold Warrior toe to toe on national security, advocating from the right, not the left - and he won. Interesting stuff.  - A must for anyone who wants to be informed.  urlLink Ten truths about trade  also from Reason. Why trade, globalization, and offshoring are all good for the US economy and nothing to be afraid of. And why this is not the first time we've been terrified that we were running out of jobs.  - It's  urlLink Election time  in the world's fourth most populous  and largest muslim country - Indonesia! For the first time in their history, the Indonesian people are directly electing their President (previously it had been done by the National Assembly). An extremely high turnout of 80% and the calm professionalism (barring a Pop Idol contest between two leading former generals) of the election seems almost shocking compared to the typical, if biased, news that comes out of Indonesia. There have been some ballot tampering concerns, but for the most part it appears to havee gone off without a hitch across Indonesia's 17,000 islands. No one candidate appears to have managed the required 50% to declare immediate victory, so there will be Run-Offs in September. The front runner Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, an former General who is pro west and reform and heads his own small party, with 34% of the counted vote will likely face off against his former boss and current President Megawati Sukarnoputri, who has managed 27%.   That's enough linking for now. I'm tired and need to sleep for once. The new Economist has a bunch of great articles this week - I would link but most are suscriber only. I may do a more detailed analysis/rant when I have more time. Whatever forces me to learn about a subject. I do need to read more about Yukos, and that certainly falls into the very boring category. Hugo Chavez is also doing his best to boondoggle the opposition who finally got a referendum/recall vote on his presidency to come about. Should be interesting. More famously, Bill Cosby, along with Jesse Jackson, has come out with a widely publicized harsh broadside against black america and education. It can actually be tied together with the criticism against Affirmative Action, and perhaps Bush's least touted initiatives and possible successes, No Child Left Behind. Who wants to try hard when you don't have to? And why does prejudice and poverty hold back African American children when Asian Americans from the same settings can achieve? If there truly is a cultural difference in Asian values, can't there possibly be some negative cultural influence against education in (young) Black America? Bill Cosby seems to think so. But I may just be being racist.  But I'm done for now.

       Incredibly tired. Three hours of accidental sleep before a test is never a good thing. Leaves one drained. Which is a good word for how I feel right now - drained and burnt out. These six weeks of class day in and day out have really worn on me, especially considering that I didn't even have a weekend size break between my last final and the beginning of this program. Essentially I went and tacked ten more weeks of classes onto my junior year. Still not over for me yet. I am really beginning to loathe actually going to class. Being far from home is something I can deal with, if still annoying; but this is really starting to get on my nerves. Which means I don't pay enough attention in class, which begins to defeat the entire purpose of spending ten weeks here. I just, just need a break. The weekends don't feel nearly long enough.   Oh well, had to do this sometime.  Only four more weeks. That's a good thought I guess. Than three weeks of 'freedom', then school. Cool.  I'm beginning to worry that class may not be all that it could be, and that Latin is to blame. For the past few weeks of heard increasing bitching and whining of the head teacher's superficial methods, and I've brushed it off. I mean for god's sake, we're learning Arabic here. Chill out. But now I'm thinking that the reason I haven't complained or noticed is because I've never learned a language completely before. I've been taking latin since seventh grade, and I've never known a different learning method. With latin, it's entirely expected to use english constantly in tandem with Latin, to discuss the grammar methods only in english, and well...to use English. We don't speak latin, so there is no way around it. But you can speak Arabic. Maybe we should be using it more. That's how the French and Spanish classes work at school - they phased out english entirely a long time ago. Maybe it's just never occurred to me.   Speaking of Latin; I need to get back to studying. Someone has to. I won't let this year be dominated by one person. And I won't let some new person show me up either. If I can't motivate myself through aspiration for success, maybe I can do it through hate and jealousy. Whatever works.  At least I don't have luck like  urlLink this . Jesus christ. This is the last thing we need - Great Whites smart enough to work in pairs. The ocean just got a whole hell of a lot more scary. And there's something terrifyingling omninous about "'If they've tasted human blood, then they'll remain a problem until we've tracked them down,". I don't know if that or  urlLink inter-species  cooperation is worse.  Gonna put up a Boring, yet important later, I think. Maybe not. Keep an eye out. It's not like anyone but me reads them. But the force me to keep abreast. Just so fucking tired.

       Sweet fancy moses.   This blog must be some form of wish machine.   It's over, and it's because she doesn't like herself, and it's not a reflection on me. As I told her, it's cool, be happy, this was the obvious outcome, and we can still be friends.   Hahahaha!  I want a pony now. Do your magic blog genie!  Too bad I still kinda miss home. And too bad I'm going to be stupid enough to kick myself about this later.  Now I'm manic emo! Time to sleep!

         Double Huh    I think I've experienced more in the past two day than in any other short period I can remember. And I don't know how I feel about it.   After/During the whole time, which I now wonder if I was really interested, I kept thinking of a quote from  The Fly :  "Flesh does not motivate me. No, mine is a penentration beyond the veil of flesh."  Horribly emo I know, but there's just something that strikes me about it. I need to think about this much more, but I think I may have pulled myself in far too deep. Maybe I should just go along for the ride.  Is it a bad thing that I kind of wish I was home? The constant classes are wearing down on me, and I somewhat miss talking to people I know.   This is really the most interesting thing going on right now in my life, and it should be. But still, why do I feel so strangly enthusiastic yet unmotivated? Hah, when did I get so apathetic - must be the lack of sleep. I'm not really suprised that with this outcome though. I just realized I need a friend more. I'll do a boring yet important later. There are some very important things going on, and they should be touched upon. But right now, I don't know how to feel. Not really sad, but not estatic either.  At least I can  urlLink look foward  to things and  urlLink laugh  at others still.   And now I wonder if this at all aptly describes how I feel right now.  Oh well. I shouldn't complain so much.

       Think I flunked my midterm. That was 25% of my grade. Dang.   Probably some way I can make it up.   Smoking makes me cool. But I'm pretty fucking cool already.  I need to see Lost in Translation, as thats apparently the kind of relationship girls want with me. I don't know how to feel about that. I also felt a need to update, just not a need to do it well.  Sounds like the only logical plan to me.  urlLink He  probably has like at least an mba.

       Just finished moving to my new room over in Branford. Pretty fucking sweet. First floor, big room, big suites, and only two people. They ignored our requests for me to stay with my old suitemate the chainsmoking hard drinking korean, but whatever. He was cool, but we'll survive. He got stuck with six other people in his room, so sucks to be him. I wonder if I'll ever see him again in the next five weeks - our scheldules were completely different. Oh well, so long Heejae Yang.   They had us move because of the mass influx of high schoolers in the second session, which begins sunday (classes monday) - from fifteen people to one hundred ninety-five people. I guess I'm going to miss all the people who are leaving from the first session. They were all pretty cool and nice guys. The intimacy was always a plus, as there was only fifteen of us, so we only filled up one housing section. Always hanging out in each others' rooms. C'est la vive. I only took like ten pictures total in the past five weeks, so I'll probably forget them by the time school starts. Only five high schoolers are staying over from the first sesssion to the second. My old suitemate, the two sisters which includes 'the girl' (whom considering she is now housed way the hell away from me and class scheldules, I will also probably never see again), and this one girl who is taking spanish.  Not much else is going on. I have a midterm monday, which is incredibly sucky, as that's July fifth. So instead of partying on the fourth, I have to study for a test worth twenty five percent of my final grade. It's gonna be pretty insane. I need to learn like seventy new words back and fourth, with the only similarity between being that their singular and plural forms are completely different. Also a whole hell of a lot more translations, telling time, all sorts of fun shit. Arabic is annoying.  Speaking of tests, I found out my APs. Let's just say I'm incredibly happy.   I don't think I'm going to finish unpacking until tomorrow for my room. I hope my new suitemate is cool. I also hope/wonder if anyone read that last post I did. Even if no one did, or if the people who did thought it was terrible, I'm going to start proofreading and spell checking those things. That was just embarassing.  urlLink This  guy sure as hell wouldn't agree with what I said, but at least I didn't ignore the foreign based and backed insurgents. It's not like they're exactly part of the Iraqis for Iraq but against the US group. They fall into a much different category. But never say I don't provide alternate viewpoints here.    Boring, yet Important   - Possible bad  urlLink news  for Bush and for America as a whole - Job growth slowed dramatically in June, as employers added just 112,000 workers to payrolls last month, a number that came in well below forecasts by private economists. Bush still praised the report and used it as proof for the 1.5 million jobs gained since August. The Treasury Secretary noted that the Labor Department's house survey, which uses different methods (an exact method is a notoriously controversial to economists) showed a growth of 295,000 jobs in June.   - Preparing/worrying for the future. The US Navy is planning a massive show of force in the Pacific Ocean near China to register a point with Beijing. An unprecedented seven aircraft carrier strike groups will be organized for an excersize well within striking distance of China. Presumably, this is to remind China the US's somewhat undeclared policy in dealing with Taiwan. China currently only has the ability to confront one CGO, let alone seven. If worse came to worse, (depending on the effectiveness of the AEGIS anti missle system) Taiwan may be bombarded all to hell, but no Chinese troops should make it to the island and effectivly occupy it.  -The Federal Reserve has  urlLink raised  interest rates for the first time in over four years. A steady stream of further rises in the cost of borrowing is now likelyunless Americas high-spending, heavily-indebted households suddenly retreat  - Dance you magnificent bastard,  urlLink dance .    That's all for now.

       No Christyn, I deserve nothing of the sort.  /3rd person  Tyson will be arriving at KCI at roughly 5:00 PM on Saturday, August 7th, 2004.  He is taking a side trip to Maine on the 6th. He will be very tired and will have traveled all day.  He is actually beginning to feel a mixture of sadness and blind rage at leaving, among other things best not discussed.  If there is no banner nor some sort of altar with votive candles set up waiting for him, he will be severly disappointed in you all.  He has missed you all a great deal, and is excited to see you all again, and to leave some of the bullshit here far far far behind.  He is also now the proud owner of his very own Hookah.  That is all.
