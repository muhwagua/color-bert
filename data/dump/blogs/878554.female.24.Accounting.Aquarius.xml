      Today when the work day was done, the outside was pure paradise. The sun had come through  the clouds and the rain had vanished.Instead of the usual muggy, sticky weather that we are so blessed to have here, someone finally said that enough was enough and gave us a breeze that would take your breath away. And thats how my evening began...  Having dinner cooked for you, is above and beyond the call of duty. And it was so good, everything fit.The taste was arousingly exotic. And then as soon as i could look up, there he was, prepared, Jeff Buckley. We watched the whole concert. And with song by song it was perfect. There was a nice cool breeze coming from the windows that entered in the house. The antique lamp and the candles gave off the  yellow-gold light, and i knew that it just could not get any better. The-light- it was so right, so percise.  I thank you for nights such as these.....

      Today I feel a feeling that comes along ever so often, it is the feeling of happyness, but to where you don't have to smile so often. Its not a blah, but a feeling of peace, a feeling of comfort. The feeling of the cool wind blowing through the hair and slightly across the face. Needless to say, its nice.    Last night i had a wonderful time. We went to eat and to the comedy club. We always have fun at the comedy house, because even if the show were to hold no laughter, we would somehow create our own. And that too me is worth much more than the show itself. I have come to realize that simple times are coming to be the best times that i hold dearly in my heart. The times that we will sit and talk, and make jokes that only us would laugh at, over a wonderful cup of coffee. Or the times that we sit in silence, and let the power of music. I am a true believer that moments like this can only be shared my similar souls. And knowingly, that it is hard to find, i take it as a gift that is given to me every single day.   He seems to be more pleasant towards me in the passing days, and that relaxes me. We are floating on the same cloud that i hope never touches the ground, for this is absolute perfection

      This is the start of starting over..... I neglected the mind to write the thoughts of the me that I am thinking of. The writing will continue once more for the feeling of freeing the mind is peaceful. In here I am everything that I need to be. In here I can say the things that perhaps I would not dare say on the outside. In here my true thoughts and feelings are revealed.   So here we go, another month, another day, another time....  The world has taken on so many changes, 10% of the people who live here, are now acting a little different, and the stock market is just about where it left off. Its a shame, in one year the world has rotated right back to about where it left off. Things don't change, because normally people do not. My money situation has currently brought me to a halt, and has opened my eyes. Of course the reality of my own day by day usage was brought up by a certain someone. Its funny that I will put something off for so long, but it takes one time for him to say it, and IM right on that idea. What do you call that? And better yet, Why does that happen? I guess it just ends up making sense.  I am planning a night out with him.On Thursday.. IM hoping that he ends up enjoying himself, and has fun. I will not tell him where I plan on taking him, but he does get to pick the restaurant. And who knows, I might end up picking that too.   Details I know that you want to know, but of course its not Thursday yet, stay tuned.

      "Oh, God, I know no joy as great as a moment of rushing into a new love, no ecstasy like that of a new love. I swim in the sky; I float; my body is full of flowers, flowers with fingers giving me acute, acute caresses, sparks, jewels, quivers of joy, dizziness, such dizziness. Music inside of one, drunkenness. Only closing the eyes and remembering, and the hunger, the hunger for more, more, the great hunger, the voracious hunger, and thirst."    (Anais Nin- May 30, 1934)

      How could i forget........  This past weekend, Jason invited me to go with him too see his buddy Rick again. This would be a moving trip, seeing how he is moving into his new house. We get there, and there are numourus people outside, Jason and I just look at each other. We get out of the car, and the Rickster sees us. His buddy J! The smile that came over his face was fantastic. So we hopped into the crowd and helped out. Hours later we are still helping, and with amazement we are still smiling. We loved being there, it was great. Ricks new house was quite awsome. The yard has so much that you could do with it. And the house just seemed to fit them better. They had a wonderful front porch decked out with a swing. One thing  that i loved was the 2 huge car garage. The breeze was nice, as we watched Ricks kids play with their grandparents.  It was a great trip, i would love to do it again. And i hope that we will.................hehe Oh yea, J let me drive the HONDA all the way back to my doorstep, he rocks!

      My moods have become quite muffled here recently. The people around me are confusing. They jump from one mood to the next without taking a breath. I seem to never get to the point where i can please them all at once. But i guess if i could, life would be much too simple. So i walk on pins and needles with a smile, hoping that they seem to wanna smile back.   Turning the page........ I get to go see amy  this coming up weekend. I cant wait too go. IT will be a fun trip, going there and hanging out. Mabye we will be able to do more things than we did last time. I sure hope that J and I dont get mad at each other, that would make for a rotton trip, and either of us like to give in. J tends to judge me quick, or pop off remarks that hurt my feelings. For 9 hours there and back, that totals up too 18 hours that dead silence can occur from being pissed at one another, and that would fucking suck. I can only hope for the best.................

      I have become very lazy when it comes to this.....  This past weekend J and I went to Kentucky to see Amy. It was a very nice trip, the only bad part was coming back. The drive was long and we were beat! We got too meet Amys new boyfriend. He was very nice and J and i hope that he stays around.   The last couple of days here has been cloudy and rainy. Im very tired of the rain and hope that it hits the road soon. There have been quite alot of people leaving the Parks and Tourism circut. Mabye its an conspiracy, who knows.   This October i am wanting to buy a pumpkin and do some really cool carving on it, and post it up on the front porch. That would be cool. Last year i bought a Scarecrow to put in the front yard. It was nice, i love to decorate for the season. I think that my tree will stay the same as last year. It was purple! It was very cool....... I want to get Mika a stocking as well, she deserves one.   It will be hard for me to try and figure out what to get J for Xmas. I guess i need to start thinking about it now, before it gets too late. I mean i know things that i can get him, but (ahem) in my budget is the problem. I need to keep my eyes open for casual hints.

      I did something that was long overdue, and i made myself make time to do it. This past weekend i went too see my Sister, and her baby. I dont call, i just hop in the car and drive over there and hope that she is home. So i pull up and get out, and she comes outside. The look on her face made my day. She was so happy to see me. So we ended up going to the pumpkin patch and picking out some pumpkins. It was alot of fun, and im glad that i did it. Mabye it wont be so long before i do it next time.  J is going with Eric this weekend to pick up Erics new Corvette. They are going all the way to Virginia.(13 hours) I will miss him this weekend......... I would love to go, but with Ken starting his new job, my paycheck is the only one coming in, plus the fact that there has been a Holiday, my check will be coming in a day late. So there is no way that i could afford to go..God i want too though. I dont want him to make the trip back alone, and i would want him to be there for me if i had too do that. And i really want too be, but i just cant this time, i just cant...  untill the next time....

      XMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  Is so right around the corner. I love this time of year. This year i will be able to go home for Christmas, and that excites me. Home, the vision of home is a warm feeling. My moms smile, the food being cooked and a fire in the fireplace. I love home, i miss home. With each year it is getting harder and harder to be so far away from my mom. But most of my life i have been independent, so i have never run home for assistance. I hold her so close to me, and dance on her every word. She is my light.   This year i have someone new to buy for. I thought that J would be hard to buy for, but he really isnt. I guess with both of us being broke about 99% percent of the time, there are quite a few things that we would not mind having! One of the things about christmas that i do like, is buying presents for everyone. I love to surprise people or see the look on their faces. That seems to be my total satisfaction. I love the wrapping, and the detail that i can go into in doing so. Even though they will be ripped apart, its still awsome.  The wonderful decorations everywhere, people bundled, and the whole soft image of the holidays. I love christmas music and im a huge fan of lights. One thing that i remember, is on christmas eve about 11 or so in the evening, Mom and i would drive around too see the lights one last time. But in the mist of doing so, we would see moms and dads sneaking presents in from their cars. It was awsome, and is a fond memory in my heart.  On a darker note, people in this world can be very selfish. And i work with a couple of  the worlds finest. Yes, every once and awhile it is your right to be so. Dont bite the hand that could help you out later.....   But all in all, these last couple of days have been very good on the mind side. Some of my problems have been lifted by the kindness of one. Im very glad that i do not feel like i did about 2 days ago. That was a really rough time for me, even though i am not fully over it.

      "To be nobody but yourself-in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you everybody else- means to fight the hardest battle- any human being can fight-and never stop fighting" E.E. Cumming  Yesterday like today is an absolute mess. The outside world is cold wet and rainy, and the furious wind has not let up. The work day was horror from the start. A grumble of passing words were applied to him and I. And i went home. When i got home last night, i took off my clothes, popped in Jeff Buckley (Grace) and soaked in a hot bath. Funny how i think  that a bath will cure all my stress and problems. I sat in the bath and stared up at he celing, i tossed and turned in the bath like you would a sleepless night. I have sunk into depression. The time laps seemed like 10 min of staring into space, but ended up being a little over 2 hours. Everything that i had on my mind was thought about, but my main brain frame was stuck on him. Built up thoughts and perhaps happy times were brought into the deep blank stare. I would love  to throw myself in safe mode and never say anything again. My body just feels weird, and i dont feel much like anything anymore. To have a really happy moment is almost a complete fade, and im stuck here. Too be here is fuzzy, and itchy at  the same time. As i watched the candle flicker out in the corner of the tub, and the water around me was cold, and no longer warm, i felt that it was my duty too pull myself out. And i did.  Drying myself off, i stopped and sat there and stared into the mirror. What a yucky yucky waste. I stumbled past the christmas tree that i really think i should have left in  the box this year, and went right for the couch. I would have gone too bed, but i glanced at the clock and it was only 7:30. "I cannot be a total waste" i said to myself, and figured that mabye i could catch something on the tube.   Channel flipping for the last hour has made me begin to grumble to myself. At this point i see the books that are lying on the table in front of me. Knowing that i should be reading, seeig how i am way behind on catching up. He has givin me many books, and i have just labled myself a total slacker. I really do want too read, but feel that my mind was not capable of doing so, in that moment. So the books stayed there and i gave them a glance every hour on the hour. So  of course i flip some more, "why cant i stop thinking about him" flip some more michelle, flip some more.  Out of the hours that i spent flipping, i finally ran across something that that made itll worth while, and it only lasted about 5 min. Imagine that. It was on MTV, of all places. Norah Jones, one video, one slight smile.....gone... The rain grown louder on this fucking tin can that i call home. And the clock on the wall now says 2:48. I whisper to myself, go to bed.   I cant.. I might miss something, like he might call...  How pathetic am i, to actually think that someone who rarly calls to begin with, would call me near 3 in the morning. Perhaps he  might.. Perhaps he has been in bed for hours now, sleeping and dreaming. Perhaps i need to block him out, he has only caused pain. But love usually comes before  that, thats why it is a constant struggle.                                Im strong, im struggling  I went too bed, only to wake to more pounding rain and swollen eyes. Drag myself out of bed, to drag myself into work. Well its 11:13 now and no words have been shared between us. Not like i expected him to say anything, because thats how he is. But i have made no attemp either. What does that mean? We are stubborn that is what that means.   Another waste of a day, another loss of good thoughts and happy memories. Not a smooth day, and i only have 6 1/2 hours to go. hoorah. As one of my co-workers mentions to me that i just dont look happy, and i respond to her im not, i see him for the first time today. He walks past my desk and heads out the fucking door. well, lunch is cancelled.   "I had to breath myself through the rage within-even though the sun is shining, i cant avoid the lighting"

      For the last couple of days, i have been having some problems with my blogger. It has not allowed me to post anything. But now it wants to work, go figure.  Im all around excited, i am going to travel on an Amtrak train after christmas. Im going from here to Iowa, to see jason and to meet his family for the first time. Im siked!!! The train will have an observation car, that will be so awsome, i can take picture after picture. And im sure that it will be laptop ready. I will be traveling alone, i would rather have someone with me, seeing how i will be on there for about 9 Hours. Then after the train comes to an end, i will hop on a bus to take me the rest of the way. I love to travel, and this will be a experience for me. I cant wait!  I would love to travel and see chris in Hawaii, but im sure my funds could not afford that trip. I would have to look into that. I could go and stay with him for a couple of days, and meet his wife and child. That would be really cool also. Pictures that i could take from there, would be incredible im sure.   Well i might update later... Got to get back to work!!!

      Complications of the family: This is a hard time of the year when everyone wants a peice of your time.  Today my mom calls me at work, she wanted to know when i had planned on coming down for christmas. I told her when i was able too, turns out that she gets upset because it is not as long as she assumed. Now normally i eat my words, and agree and do what she wants me to do. This year i could not, i had to many things to do, and places to be. So she lables me for thinking that others are more importent than her. How do i get around this one? I have already apologized and said that i was sorry, and nothing is working, so here i sit and wait.  Christmas is already gloomy for me this year, because funds are so low. I have tried so hard to try and please everyone, and like always,it just does not happen. I honestly want to stay at home, and if anyone wants to give me anything, then they can come to my house. Im so tired of stressing out and driving myself crazy to please everyone. And then once everything is running smoothly, i never get any credit for anything.  On a lighter note: Today at work was not as crappy as it could have been, time inched along, but i have had worse days. So there-fore i cannot complain. I play pool tonight in my BCA league. I hope  that we do really good tonight. I was going to have Jason, and a couple of others from work come and watch the tournament, but at the last min. they had to bail. Thats ok though, there will always be next week and the week after that.   The weather is crappy here, cold cold cold. I wonder what the weather is like where Chris is? I bet he is letting the sun cascadeoff of him. He needs to know how lucky he really is!!!!!!  heh   Well im gonna get off of here... might update later tonight, and give the BCA score!!!!!

        Today is sunday, and i have been so lazy. I have really done nothing. I moved my computer into the living room today so i can sit on the couch watch the tube. Dirty Dancing was on, that is my second fav. movie. And yes my first is pretty women. Two totally flick chics but they are so awsome. I just got through sending Chris an E-mail! His E-mail is back up again. I would love to see him agian. I have not seen him in quite some time.  Today i was really planning on going to see my dad. He only lives about 2 hours from me. Jason was going to take me too see him. But things just didnt seem to work out. So i was sitting on the couch talking to jason on IM, and lisa shows up. She wanted me to go with her. So chucky, dennis, lisa and i went christmas shopping. That lasted about 4 hours, and now i am at her house. Im about to sit down and watch a movie with her. While she was finishing up a couple of things i just thought that i would hop on here and update the blog.  Well i need to get off and watch this movie, untill tomorrow, its me heading out!

      Yesterday i was having the worse day at work. Everyone was so bitchy, and they were getting on my nerves. Then after work it was planned that i go home with Jason because we were going to have our Christmas. So i did and i gave him his gifts, and he gave me mine. This was the best christmas! He ended up getting me books,dvd, and all the music that i asked him to burn he had done. BUT that was not the best part. HE built me a computer. How awsome is that. With me saving for another car, i was not able to save for a better computer. And he came through for me. I even cried, i could not handle it. It was so thoughtful and something that i really wanted.  Today is my last day at work before my 9 days off, hoorah! I cant wait to pack up and get the hell away from my co-workers for awhile. The holidays are really almost over, and i cant wait for a better year next year. This year has been way to stressful for me. I cannot wait to get home and play on my computer and get all of my settings together. I also cannot wait to hop on the train and head out to IOWA. That will be so much fun. Im glad that chris said that he has done that before, so im not so nervous.

      The weather is still nice here, a tad bit chillier than yesterday, but still considered nice. The sky is no longer partly cloudy, it has turned dark and stormy looking. When i went out for lunch it started to sprinkle, but no major storm yet.  This morning was nice, my co-workers and I exchanged presents and we all had a good time. I also brought food for everybody this morning. Two more days and then i am off for a week!    I have not heard from chris in awhile, i wonder how he is doing?  I might throw him an e mail.....

      Ah, Monday was a typical Monday.  -TIME LAPSE-  AH, Tuesday is a typical Tuesday.  Today i have been so tired, i even stayed home last night and hung around the house. But im still dead tired. I feel that my eyes are gonna close on me, and i will have no control over them. Monday eyes on a Tuesday day. Work is dragging a tad, but it could be worse. Today is an awsome day when it comes to the weather. IT is about 70 today, and its in December. I love the weather, but that fact of that matter is, TORNADOS. Now i never really thought about tornados before i moved here, but i have seen two, and the last one jumped right over my house. So no, i do not play around when it comes to mother nature. My house is right in the path where they hit too. So i always have my eyes peeled.  I bought a new lamp to put on my desk at work. Its the cutest little thing, i love it. Its purple and see through, and its too cute. See little things make me happy, lol. Well i really shoudl go, i am still at work, and as you can tell im not that busy right now. heh.  NoTe To SeLf ********* Try and update your blog on a daily basis, stop being such a slacker!

      Sunday, is it Sunday already? I dont understand where any of the time goes. At least this will be the last week of work before my 9 days off. Yesterday i hung out with Jason and we ran some errands, and then i went out with Lisa, Drew, and Ken to eat dinner and to watch a movie. Yes i am a fan of Emenim, Lisa and i love him, so we went and finally watched his movie *8 Mile*.  I would have to say that it was a good movie, but i guess i expected it to be better than what it was.  Today i got up and cleaned the house, Ken went to play golf, and Jason came over. We lounged around the house and then ran some more errands. After we got done he dropped me off, and the i went over to Lisa's. Since this week and the next will be hectikfor me, we decided that we would go ahead and do OUR gift exchange. So i went over there and we ate pizza and exchanged gifts. It was cool. I am glad that i have someone like Lisa.  And now i am back home wondering where my weekend went! They say that the older you get the faster the time goes! I really am starting to believe it,lol. That reminds me, (gasp) my birthday is coming up. Im going to be 23! (February 18th)   I went ahead and orderd my ticket for Amtrak. I really am thrilled that i am going. But it is gonna be sooo cold there. Im a TEXAS girl, and i dont adapt to 10 below zero very well! Damn Yanks, they like it cold,lol. Im know that i am already going to get teased because im from the south. And i have that so called "twang". But thats ok, i will put them in their place. *wink*  If i do that for anyone it will be for Chris!

      I forgot to mention the movie that J and i saw on the 7th. We saw "Gangs of New York". Its an absolute deep thinking movie and i loved it. Too me, if you are a deep thinker and would love to learn about sacrafice and demand, this is a movie for you! It was wondeful, although i hate to say that i cant go into detail about the movie. Its something that you have to see on your own, and make your own judgments. On a scale of 1-10 im gonna give it an 8. But, the feeling that it leaves you with is...............watch it!  Daniel Day Lewis's voice sends chills down my spine, oooh sensual, and Good ole' DiCaprio's face and facial hair make me wanna..... you know! :  Martin Scorsese's sweeping tale follows a young Irish-American immigrant, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), who returns to the Five Points section of New York City in 1863. His father (Liam Neeson) was killed there 16 years earlier by William Cutting, a k a Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a powerful anti-immigrant gang leader. Cameron Diaz co-stars as a pickpocket who was raised by Cutting in her youth and who is now in love with Amsterdam. Around them, the Civil War is in full swing, and the upcoming conscription is throwing the city into a panic, culminating in a city-wide riot.  Release Date December 20, 2002   MPAA Rating  R - intense strong violence, sexuality/nudity, and language   Genre Drama, Crime, Historical   Running Time  165 minutes   Country  U.S.   Media Type  Color   Filming Location(s)  Rome   Another really good movie to watch out for is "The Hours". Its coming out on Jan. 17th!  I will be in the movie theater! Jason introduced me to the book, and i finally got around to reading it. And now the movie is gonna kick ass!  Some Info:  Based on Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Hours draws on the life and work of Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) to tell the story of three women: Woolf, who is portrayed in the throes of writing Mrs. Dalloway and contemplating suicide; Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), a young pregnant wife and mother in the suffocating confines of her tidy little life in Los Angeles in 1949; and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), who is giving a party in the present in New York for her closest friend, Richard (Ed Harris), an award-winning writer dying of AIDS.   NOT just a chick flick! ITs a must see baby........   LORD OF THE RINGS KICKED ASS! Lets not forget that one........Legolas is soooooo hot......kinky shelle likes Bow and Arrow!

      "For me atmosphere and fantasy in music are really important,". "I think I'm an escapist really, even though I like dark things in music, and I think there are moments of darkness in this, but I like darkness when its fantastical and Scary Movie-ish rather than just bleak and gritty. I suppose that if music didn't give us this glimpse of something better I don't think we could stand to go on with our lives, we'd just give up. I think in any type of music, not just mine, the best of it gives you a glimpse of paradise, or a better world or some hope. Its like you can achieve some sort of... I don't know if I'd say perfection but something free from all the shit of your life, in music."  Frou Frou: a sound that drives you happy.  Lyrics to Breathe in:  I read you and God I'm good at it I'm so spot on Chord shapes in air go press that dissonance if you dare And you breathing in finesse an innocent From her partying  And I'm high enough from all the waiting To ride a wave on your inhaling And I'm high enough from all the waiting To ride a wave on your inhaling 'Cause I love you no? Can't help but love, you know...  What part of no don't you understand I've told you before To just get off my case this isn't happening stop this now And I where was I?

      It has turned cold here, and the sky is really putting off the cloudy "its winter time" theme.  It is sort of late and i should be in bed, but im not!  Next Thursday i plan on going to the Gym with my sister. I wanted to go tonight. But i was having some problems with my computer and had Jason come over and fixedt. I cant believe that its only Monday. After you take off for so long i guess it seems like the days that you do work are just extra long. I didnt play pool tonight, and i am gonna hang out with J tomorrow night. But i have to play pool on weds. I wanna do something, but not sure as to what i really wanna do. I want to like take a trip or something. Even though i got back from Iowa not too long ago, i yet again crave another trip. I like being places where i have to discover things i guess. I like being alone ina sense of people that you normally see are miles away. Thats groove.  I think that J and i might go see a movie tomorrow. Although there are alot of movies that i wanna see. Im not sure what we are gonna watch yet. I guess we will find out when we walk into it. Thats me, i hardly ever plan, because when i do, things dont turn out like you planned! lol  Now my eyes are getting droopy, i wonder what that means? TIRED I AM.     Even though i hate AOL, i actually went browsing in the settings and found this awsome LORD OF THE RINGS background of "LEGOLAS". Oh man he is so HOT! I loved that movie and recently watched the Twin Towers. It was good, not as good as the first, but real good. Just like Star Wars, im hooked!  Well i need to get off here and hit the pillow, Love ya world, Michelles back in action thanks to Jason!  SHELLE

      Last night was quite the night, I get off work to go tan. I walk in there and the lady that owns the place was actually working. I ask her what products to use and what might be healthy for my skin. And she was quite upset that the other ladys let me in there for 30 min. And therefore allowed me to burn. So she ended up throwing me in there for about 15 min this time and didnt mark me down for having a visit. I thought that was really cool, that makes me think that she values her customers. I told her that i was not there to get a free visit or to get anyone in trouble, i just wanted to make sure that i was not doing harm to my skin. So i ended up tanning and i still feel great, no burns, no peeling.  After i was done tanning i headed out for the gym. The gym was rather crowded, and i was surprised seeing how it was about 8:00. So i go in there and sweat sweat, and get in the sauna for a bit. I actually used more weights than i do normally, and when i woke up this morning the muscle that goes up my leg and behind my knee is killing me. I must have pulled it somehow, and now i cant bend my knee all the way, not including this wonderful crick that i have in my neck as well. (im turning 23 im falling apart). So im no longer burned, but my body parts are giving out. So my work day is full of limping around like a gimp, but it makes you think about little things that you take for granted!  Then when i get home from the gym, Jason instant messages me and says that his dad called him and told him that his Grandmother will be passing soon. He was pretty upset, so i hopped back in the car and went over there to make sure that he was alright.i Think that he might be going to Iowa this weekend. Last weekend i cancelled card night and this weekend he will be cancelling card night. Perhaps next weekend. Next weekend i plan on introducing SKIP-BO to Stacey,Linda,Eric, and Jason. Im sure that they will like it. When we all have card night we usually play a game called PHASE-10. Its really fun, and we all laugh and pick on each other and have a good time.  Tonight i plan on going back to the tanning bed and mabye hitting it for about 20 min or so. I will not be able to work out for i am crippled. So i think that i will be tanning, then going home and cooking some dinner tonight. Perhaps i will cook some Chicken Spagetti. Not really good for my diet, but everyone needs a treat some time. seeing how i have not had a soda since New Years Eve. Not even a diet soda! I have been drinking water, and Crystal Light has become my next best friend. Even though Crystal Light is a tad bit expensive, the Kroger brand is just as good. So that is the way that i go. YES  Chris called me last night and i was not able to talk with him very long because i was headed out towards that tanning place. But i love to hear from him, and he will call me back on Saterday.   I finally got my stove fixed last night as well. We were having a mice problem for awhile there, and finally were able to get rid of them. Well one day i went to heat up the stove to boil some water, and this awful smell started to come out of the burners and oven. I about threw up it was sooooooo bad. I had to shut everything off and air out my house. I scrubbed and cleaned my stove from top to bottom, turned it back on and there was no diffrence. What had happened was that a mouse got in the padding around the oven that keeps everything else from getting hot. When he got in there he was starting to make my stove his home. Just like hamsters chew things to make a bed, this is what he was doing. Peeing and pooping in there, GOD, you could imagine the smell of that alone! Then Ken takes off the top and there he is. There is a mouse that is dead and cooked to the side of the stove. I WANTED TO THROW UP!  But that was what it was. Now the problem is all taken care of, and i am a happy cooker once more.Its amazing, the little things that seem to make me happy at certain times, ha......  Well i really need to get some stuff done, so im gonna stop rambling!  See ya..

      Today is Sunday, normally i would be in s sigh because work is tomorrow, but tomorrow is MLK and Robert E. Lee day. One of the perks of working with the state is that we seem to get a day off when someone sneezes. Ha, im not complaining! So i know that i have another day of being lazy and getting enough free time to go to the gym. I have become a gym junkie. Not so much that that is a bad thing, but can get kinda costly. I wish that Chris would hurry up and open is gym, mabye at least he would give me a discount, and i could higher him as my personel trainer.   Today is such a wonderful day, well, weather wise. Its sunny and the wind is blowing a tad bit hard, but it brings a cool breeze. When i went walking today i went to the top of the hill close to the house. You can see for quite a ways from there. And i just stood there, the breeze blowing my hair back and fourth on my back,and me lost in teh scene that was before me. All the tall grass blowing one way then to the other. The trees seeming as if they were gonna bend and possibly break, and the sun to give no shadow. Another moment in my life where i could say im happy to be there at that moment in time. Wanting to stay there forever, knowing that as soon as i take a step away that moment is over. I will always save them in my mind, but the graphic graphic picture is gone. Although i have done many things today, it just seems like the day is flying by.   I went to the motorcross show last night. It was really neat, i had a good time. Although when i arrived and looked around, it was like every Redneck in Arkanasas and the surrounding cities was there pushed all together in that arena. I was just putting points left and right on my list of *why to be ashamed of Arkansas*.   Not only were the adults bad enough, but that things that they do to there children. All the boys had the buzz cut with the long hair towards the back. And all the girls just seemed to look dirty. I honestly to not know how that the two sexs even come together to reproduce. Yes, Yes, i understand that there is at least a handful of these kinds in every city and state. But to be surrounded by many at once makes you wanna take a step back and grab for the sanitizer. Please dont think that i put myself up as being the best chick to walk these grounds. But when all the men look at ya and lick there lips as like they would like to hunt ya down, Fer good eatin, humm, nuff said.  Still waiting on my chance to take another trip. I need to get away and see things. Take pictures, and be engulfed in romance.  Im actually starting to read more and do some things that i have been putting off for quite some time now. Finished one of Jasons books and returned it to him. And about an hour ago, i just came in from sitting in the sun and listening to music, and drawing. I used to draw all the time back when i lived at home. Just seems that i grew up and other activites came along with that. But i want to recapture what i had at one time. A time when i never stressed out and everything was smoother. Even though i have more freedom now, some things i would like to have back. Even though you grow up and sacrifice certain things to have other things, sometimes you do want what you had back. And really alot of times you dont even notice what you are giving up. I used to stay in my room and draw, mom would come get me for dinner. I would eat and then go right back to my desk. And to be honest, i cant remember when i stopped doing that. When i actually gave up what had intrest me for the longest time. Its true, you just look back and say, who, what, when, where, and why. And some of your answers might surprise even yourself. I have so many things that take up my time, but at the same time i try to bring back everything that i used to do, and i end up getting lost. And then i end up getting nothing done! Humm, what should a girl do...... Have you ever stopped and thought about how much people take up your time? Think about it...Think about all the people that you deal with every day, then add about 10-20 more people that are extras that you deal with every day. And then ask your self, how much time do you really have for yourself?  I need to clean my house a little, so im outta here!

      With Heavy thought I have pondered on where I would love to go, if given the chance.. And here is what I have come up with:   Seattle, Washington: Although it is definitely quite the drive from here, I have a passion for a visit! People in Seattle buy more books per capita than almost anywhere else in the United States. It is also a center of writers of all genres. It has a proliferation of bookstores, particularly specialized or quirky independent shops; coffeehouses and taverns featuring poets and open-mike readings; strong public library systems; regular author and book signings; and - perhaps most noticeably - people reading books in the most unlikely public settings."   The numerous universities and research centers located there provide training to a public eager to expand its learning and offer a tremendous research resource for the business community.Their region is second in the US in the percentage of adults with college degrees. Nearly one third have completed a bachelor's degree, and ten percent have a graduate degree.   One place that I would have to be absolutely sure to visit would be the Pike Place Market (downtown Seattle). This shopping mall has over 600 stores inside. It has everything from Bistro&#146;s to art galleries to antiques. This would have to be a day long event for shelle. Then after that day long event, my nightlife would begin. And my club of choice would be: Club Medusa&#133; The Greek mythology theme is kept to a stylish minimum; the bulk of the ambience comes from the expensive lighting, the house and trance music.   But of course before I hit the club, I would love to stop at Barca for a drink, and well, to just enjoy the view. From its gargantuan mosque-style wooden doors and cobalt blue exterior to its hand-tiled curving mosaic bar and blown-glass light fixtures, Barca oozes Euro-Mediterranean cool.Seattle has so much to offer, that i am sure one week there would not do. I would love to walk along the waterfront, go too so many coffee shops. They have live band concerts at random. What more could I ask for? This is one of my many places to roam.

      Just went outside for a smoke break, and the sky is dark, the wind is picking up and it looks like heavy rain. Seeing how is usually does, i will expect it to hit about 5:00 when its time to go. I love rain and storms, but the thing is, its warm. And when its warm and storms roll in, you guessed it, Tornados arise. And the spot where my house sits, about a couple of years ago, one came through and took out all the houses including the one that was in my spot. And before that one came through and followed the same path, and took out my moms house. Last year we had one come through and hop right over my house. I felt the wind and heard the thunder noise everyone speaks of. It was not fun and very scary. Its scary to think that every thing you own, and everything in your past can be taken away from one in seconds. Yikes!  SO needless to say in all this babble, when storms roll in and its warm, my eyes are on the sky!

      Last night was a rather emotional night, for reasons that i feel i should keep inside.  I went to bed early, my eyes were puffy and they burned. I was hoping that i was not going to get too much sleep agian, and feel like crap. So i took a shower and enjoyed the sound of running water. I had the shower on and sat in the bottom of the tub, and closed my eyes. The steam was pouring out over the top of the shower curtain, and i was in full relaxation mode.The only reason that i was tempted to get out was because where the water had beat on me, it was starting to leave red marks. Just sitting there and thinking about everything that has happend or will happen.   When i got out of the shower, i was in the mood to read. Knowing ahead of time that reading will make me tired, i did so anyways. Good ole Robert Frost to the rescue.....Ah , sweet nectar......ar ar ar   Today for lunch, J , Eric and I went to have lunch and then to pick J's car up from the shop. About 75 bucks, cheap and wonderful. And we are so happy to have the car back. SABINA is back in action.Whooo-hoooo  Im hanging out with J-tonight, not sure what we are doing, but i really dont care. His company is wonderful and i enjoy it very much so.  The weather today is cloudy and drizzle here and there. It sounds icky, but to me its rather nice. A comfortable feeling, ya know. To watch the rain and clouds. And to smell that fresh rain smell....very nice. Tis it is, reading weather.   Chatted on and off with Thomas today, he is busy, but not as busy as he has been. Feels good to talk to him, like he understands things that i deal with. He seems a little strange latley, but perhaps thats just me.  Chris Finally sent me an e mail back. Poor guy, being in the army right now is tuff, and i want him home ASAP!!!!! Chris is a grown man (25) but i know that certain things can take over your mind, and im afraid that might be happening to him in the Army! Keep your head up, and know that i watch over you Christopher!  I need to go visit my dad here soon, its been awhile and i miss him. A visit is overdue! (talk to J) Communication with the rest of my family needs to get better as well. I am a independent person and i can go weeks or months without saying a simple hello, and thats bad for me. But you also have to understand what i have been through with them. Ah well, not getting into that one....yeeesshhh  I would like  to find or get in touch with a guy that i used to date, he is awesome. His name is Justin, Thomas reminds me of him, with his laugh. And now i feel that i have to find him again. The story of Justin is, he was in a Private school, and i was in a public school. But i would always meet him and sit with him. He was incredible, very smart, he was way ahead of me at that time.We would always just talk and walk together. Never kissed or anything like that, We would hold hands, but it was diffrent, he was diffrent. He was wonderful, and i have lost him. I would want to know what he was doing and what he has become. Im sure that he is married with kids, because he was a keeper. I was too young and didnt know what i had at the time. He even dedicated a song to me on the radio one time. Funny story about that.....My mom and I were taking a movie back to Block Buster, and we were driving in the car, we were quiet, and then here is Justin, on the radio dedicating this song to me. Mom and I just looked at each other and we smiled. Nothing as said, it stayed in silence, but was a very Groovy time in my life. And to make is cheesy, the song was a Celine Dion Song. But that was when she FIRST came out and her songs were very powerful with words of love. It was nice....I will never forget that. Im wondering on how i would find him.I dont remember his last name, and he has moved since then. I remember his sisters name was Sarah. Geez, is that bad or what. How would i find him?????/ Crap, mabye i have lost him forever........

      I was able to talk to Thomas for a little bit today in the morning. He has so much going on that i guess its hard to get some talk time in. But i should be happy with what i get! Bah  Today i was missing J soooo much, he was at his Photoshop class. Im glad that he is getting to learn how to do it. Some of the things that he is learning, he can teach me. So that is a bonus!   The car is still in the shop, they will have to keep it over night. But it will be ready tomorrow, and the better news is, is that it will not cost as much as one can imagine. Her will be back tomorrow, and for that i am SO happy! Next week we are going to take her to get all her stuff checked out and make sure that she is A-ok for the trip to Dallas!  Speaking of Dallas,,,,,, yes ,,,, we are one day closer to hitting the road, and seeing Thomas, and Rick.  Have to have a day of relaxation tonight. Just catch up on reading and cleaning. Things like that seem to pile up like mad.  This week at work has been nice. Everyone is gone and its been quiet, and im able to get things done. Ah, but next week will be right back to being the same....gerrrr  AT least i got a little break, no?  Ok, i guess shelle will stop blah blah blahing and get off here.....till next time, i bid you adue.....  Ah yes, almost forgot to mention......J and I caught a interview with Ani Franco on NPR, she was great and her music rocked. J likes her voice....(note to self) ....Must learn to talk like good ole Ani! ................................Hers silly...........................................

      Yesterday was a day of a day, a dooooozy!  When i arrived at work, and saw J, he looked so tired.Poor thing, the trip must be catching up with him. J and I are diffrent in several ways, and this is one of them. Its wierd, i can be dead tired and still force and smile and be in a cheerful mood. But when he is tired, he is quiet and it seems like his daily routine is in slow-mo. Dont get me wrong, i have days like that also, but they are not as frequent as his. Anyways, He didnt feel very good and was really tired. Well he told me that he was going to stay home after lunch, and take a half a day off. So we left to go to lunch, and we were heading towards his house when we noticed that his car started to slip. That was the last thing that J needed at this point. So for lunch we went to Auto Zone and put some Trans. fluid in . Dropped J off at home and i drove the car back to work. She was acting just fine, was no longer slipping and shifting well.   Another 5 hours at work.....  After work, i got back into the car and headed off to J's house. Pulled up and told him that i really wanted to see if there was a leak. SO we pulled it up in the yard,and he started to look underneath it. He still had on his nice clothes and now they were all muddy, from the rain the night before. He was trying to see if there was a leak, and he took the tire off the car.His nice shirt rubbed across the brakes from the exposed wheel, and now he had grease on his shirt. He took off his glasses and threw them on the ground, as he was getting under the car again. He got up and walked around to move the steering wheel for the tires to move. Walked back over and stepped on his glasses, bend one side all to hell. And at this time, he was about to have a nervous break down. He couldnt take it any longer, when it rained it poured for sure today. One of those times that everything you want to do will be harder than normal, or just not work at all.  He said "fuck it" and went inside, left everything as it was. The tire was not on the car and there were tools laid out everywhere. I sat there for a sec. then went inside. I hopped on the phone to see if my buddy paul could get him in today to look at the car. Turns out that he left to go out of town.  As i was talking, J walked by and paths kinda crossed, he said "get the Fuck out of my way". I was in shock that he said it, but let him be, and went outside to finish my conversation. So i hopped on the phone with Jiffy Lube, (5:45) i told him that the car was brought in last Friday, and now there is a leak.That i dont need them to do anything, i just need them to look at it and tell me if there is a leak. So, She says :"we close at 6, if you can get here, we will look at it". I hang up, tell J that i have 15 min to get to Jiffy lube.He says that he does not want to go. So i said, fine i will go. Go put the tire back on the car. He did, slow as ever. I hopped in the car and fought 5-6 O' clock traffic. Pulled into Jiffy Lube at 6:03, they looked at it and said that we did have a leak. It was leaking from the seal, on the Drive-shaft, and leaking down the line. I said ok, thats all i needed to know. So i drove off and headed back to Js house.  When i got there J said that he was sorry for how he was acting, and i hugged him. I told him that I know how he feels and that its ok. That i know how everything can pile up on you at once and make you nearly go blind, i said that i was here for him, no matter what. And that everything will work it self out in due time, and that it will be ok......

      30 Min after i got home from work, the rain came, and it came with avengence. The rain pounded the roof, and the wind bended trees like strings, and shelle backed away from the door. The lights went out and came back on, 10 min. later and it was gone. It is usually rare to have a storm that early in the evening, but then again, alot more things are getting wierd to me. Bah...  J called and said that our bud Amy called and wanted to meet us for dinner. I was siked because we have not seen her in months. She says that she still enjoys Kentucky, and that the weather is not as bad as here. Her trip down here was tough on her, but she made it. So we headed out to eat dinner, and then all of us (5) went to Barnes and Noble. I totally went over my limit on money and books. I bought a Robert Frost Poems book, on sale mind you! I love his work, and couldnt pass it up. Along with that i bought three Photo Magazines. It wouldnt be so bad if they werent like 8 bucks a pop. But the pictures and knowlege that they hold is soooo hard to pass up. I want to be a good photographer so bad, it hurts. But i want to be good at alot of things. This seems to come a little but more natural to me, and that is quite tasty. Jason seems to think that im creative, and i take good pictures, so he gives me hope that mabye i can go somewhere with this. (sigh) will i ever be good at anything?  I stayed up so late last night, till about 2:30 or so. Just couldnt go to sleep and was playing with my camera. I should know better than to pick the camera up or get into Photoshop as the night turns into dark, because i will not get off early enough to get good sleep. And trust me, i think i need to catch up on some beauty sleep! gerrrrr........   To do list.....  1. Get Thomas's package ready 2. Work out....eeshh 3. Plan for my Dallas trip 4. Hang out with Amy 5.Get my life sorted out  Dont forget John Mayer and the Counting Crows are coming in Concert!

      ok, ok, serious shame on me, for just now getting back to my posting life.  Since you last knew anything about me, i have met another badass bud. Thomas rocks, plain and simple, for he is so funny and good for kind words. We have talked on and off on Instant Messenger, for awhile. Then it was time to meet him, and he was better than what i expected. J and I went down there to meet him, and he was so funny. He is full of creative ideas and loves to babble. And is is always paranoid about his babble, but in reality its great to listen to. Did i mention that he is badass at what he does, he takes it so lightly when i tell him that, but he is. He brought a package for me, i would have to say that i was VERY impressed. I always wait to see how things like that go, because how much time someone puts into something counts in my book. You could tell that he put some time into this, and it was awesome! The pictures alone that were made for me, took time alone. And speaking of that, they are heavenly wonderful. When i first saw them, my mouth dropped, he thought i was putting on a show im sure. But the seriousness that i had was unreal. The colors were blended with such force, very nice.The texture that it had was awesome, i couldnt keep my eyes off of it. There were 2 shirts that were also included, from a quote that came out of my mouth! Gasp@! makes me sound like a little devil......"one night the cat will own you"........Well, now i have two shirts to wear, when i feel like being openly naughty. Its cool. Also included was a wonderful packet full of doodles that he has done. They are very good, i would love to see what is not a doodle. I love nerds, and there are some packets that he gave me! THOSE ROCK.  (note to self: dammit shelle, get his package out)  I just got back form a trip, J and I went to Iowa! I had a blast, but that was to be expected! The trip down there was long but cool. My visit with his family was closer this time, and i loved it. We did a whole lot of driving on this trip, about 3000 miles total! The weather was unexpected, it grew cold and the wind was outrageous, but i seemed to manage.We went to Visit his grandmothers house that recently passed. It was hard on Jason when she passed, but going through the memories of the house got the best of him again. All i could do was hold him, for the tears he was trying to fight back were winning. Knowing in my ownmind that it will someday happen to me with my parents, its hard to think about. I would not know what to do without my family, but i know that someday i will have to deal with that. I look around and see people whos parents have passed, and often wonder how they are dealing with it. In my mind i see myself locked in a room, and never wanting to come out. But knowing that life needs to go on.  Anyways the trip was good, its awesome to get away from things for awhile, and for me its well needed.Oh yeah, J also took me by his college campus, in Aimes. The campus was full of beauty! Old buildings and landscapes, i was sooo impressed! The kind of place that pictures would do it no justice. I was able to get a picture of one of the buildings. This building was incredible.Seeing J point out everything was cool. He was so excited, and his eyes grew so big as he went through his memories of being a student again.  The trip back brought some wonderful pictures.....J was taking pictures of the sky as the sun started to leave us. I was driving about 80, had the windows down, and groove music playing. And an occasional smoke, as J took pictures of the sunset. He ended up with some incredible pictures that i will have to show Thomas.  It reminded me of him, because of all the colors working together so well, looked like a canvas. He will dig them i hope....

      Will my life ever get back on track? Not only was my dentist appt last week not a good one, but today about an hour ago, my tooth in the front of my mouth chipped! Fuck, no money, more problems. Trying my hardest to stay on top of the smile, instead of falling down beneath one. Its getting harder, no matter what i seem to do to take my mind off it. Im scared to eat, scared that i might break something else. Hey, perhaps this will be a way that i can also lose weight! hell, i dunno.  Today i went to Amber's Dad's funeral, so i guess it wasnt a good day from the start. But i had to be there for her, as i hope that she would be there for me.It was a sad day of teary eyes, looks that are not natural, and clouds that filled the sky, temping to rain. The sad letters that were read during the service from Amber and friends about her dad, thats enough for a cryfest alone. The look around the room full of people that are still in shock, and need to be held. Quite disturbing.........Her brother is a preacher, and he said that his dad asked him to preach at his funeral. So he did for a bit, and in the middle of it, he asked us to bow our heads to pray. Then he told us that everyone in this room will die, there is no doubt about it. Then he says : "If god was to come for you tomorrow, would you be ready?" "If you are not sure, just raise your hands so we can pray for you". I wanted to raise my hand, it was wierd, im not a bad person, but i dont go to church, and i just felt that i may not be accepted i guess. I dont know what to really think about it all. I didnt raise my hand. The other girls and i got into the car and followed them over to the grave site. We were talking on the way over there, and they started talking about it, well i made the mistake of saying that i sorda wanted to raise my hand. We pull up and go to the site, after the service there was over, one of my co-workers went to her brother (preacher) and told him that i was really wantingto raise my hand. So him and his sidekick came over and introduced himself, and they both took my hand and started praying about me. If that is not a shocker alone, i had closed my eyes, and was just in a uncomfortable state. Just because i was put on the spot and i felt bad about not going to church and this and that. After the 30 min prayer, it seemed like, he asked me "did you ask god for forgiveness?" I replyed truthfully, and said " i didnt think i had too, i think that he knows what i want". I was wanting to hit myself in the head!!!! It was the truth, but was hoping that he knew what i meant, instead of taking it the wrong way. And, whew, i think he knew what i was trying to say. I was kinda mad at my co-worker, i cant be mad for what she was trying to do, by all means. But i dont think its her place to force me into a situation like that. I feel, that people will know when its time. True that some need a little push, but i was just really uncomfortable.   I should be in a good mood though, i leave for Dallas tomorrow, and get to see Thomas. Perhaps he can cheer me up. Jason has been really helpful, when my tooth chipped tonight, i just had so much on my mind, and this seemed to be the last straw.I cried for about 10 min. then bucked it up. I just feel that what little i have of looks, are just going to shit. And being broke sucks ass! ah shucks....... nothing new........nothing new..........Be a man about it shelle!   1Funerals 2pets dying 3.teeth falling out and chipping 4no money, completley broke 5no emotional support    It has to get better right? please, please say yes...............................................................................................................

      Tuesday Night was a relax night.....  Got off work and went over to Js, watched some Tv, went to eat and then went to Barnes. I hate going into Barnes when im broke (oh wait, thats all the time) because i cant get anything, and there is so much that i want. After i got home, i pounced on the couch for about 10 min., then hopped up and got on the computer.   Opened up Photoshop, and stayed there until about 2 in the morning. Not bad, not bad....for me. I just had so many ideas flow to me at once, and i tried to get them all started. Needless to say that when i opened my eyes this morning, i hated the light. But drug myself out of bed, had some coffee, and im set for the day.  Today i will go to Amber's Dads funeral. It is held over in Fordyce, about an hour from here. I will ride with a couple of co-workers, and im sure the ride will be silent. I dont want to go, because i will hate to see her cry, hate hate hate it. But she needs to know that i am there for her. And i will be.  Jason took off to Petit Jean today to get some work done on there computers. We shall meet up after work once more. Thomas said that he was going to in town today, and that rocks. He said that he was going to be watching movies. I hope that he sees FRIDA! For gods sake, he paints for a living! And i thought it was MOST excellent, so i can imagine what he will think, if he would just go!!! BTW- His art is off the wall wonderful....It is a must see......I wish i had talent like he does,damn. Ah well, at least i can get lost in his work, and enjoy the serine colors of his wonderful mind.  Radio Paradise is playing Michelle Shocked (come along way) oh man that song rocks! J actually introduced me to her and that song as well, then i heard it on Radio Paradise, and that is super sweet! What i wouldnt give to be able to hear Radio Paradise in the car, SWEEEEET, but alas the money to do it with is and never was here.  My trip to Dallas starts tomorrow after work, im siked! Orderd somthing for J off Amazon, we should recieve it before we hit the road, he will be surprised. (Jayhawks new CD) hehehe......Crap, hope he dosent read this! ah shucks  Started to draw last night, didnt get very far, ended up in a mind stuck! Ah well, her has all her life to show her feelings on paper.

      Last night was trying on the mind, but as you can see im still here to talk about it. SO it cant be all that bad, eh?  Radio Paradise is playing Nick Drake and its sooo nice.... Radio Paradise has kept me sane in a number too large to count. For that i am thankful that i finally found an awesome station.   AH jeez, just got back from lunch and found out that my skirt that i had on, had a huge hole in the backof it. The seam that was right down the middle of the butt, had come lose. Goodness for me that it laid flat and didnt show anything. And for those that know me, know that i go cammando. SO yes, if anyone had seen it was pure butt. OMG, im glad that i caught it.   Whew, must check clothes before leaving the house!!!!!

      As if Mondays were not bad enough......  I am having so many problems with my Bank. But i guess  you could say that it was my fault opening with a local bank. I was having problems with my account, couldnt get a hold of them all weekend. So i try first thing this morning, and after being transferred to 3 people, i finally get to the person who is supposed to know whats going on, and she "couldnt tell me" what was happening. There systems are always down, gag, im tired of this topic. Just know that problems are occuring.  Then after lunch, i came back to work and a co-worker approched me and said that her dog died. She was really tore up about it. We have the same kind of dog, and share stories all the time. (Palmeranians) SO i could relate with her, and felt very bad for her. Then she tells me that one of our friends Dad died this morning. He had been sick with  cancer, and never smoked a Cigg. Not that Ciggs are the only way you can get cancer, just pointing it out. So that was also a shock. I feel so bad for her, i couldnt imagine losing my father. Then another one of our co-workers had a heart attack and is in the hospital. Whew, what a monday....And i thought that i was having a bad time this morning, i seemed to have taken it all for granted. It can always get worse.   They are doing something to the roof of our building, and it smells awful, its giving everyone a headache. So i have been dealing with that as well.Thomas introduced me to a site that is awesome, im going to put my work on it here soon.  urlLink     Hopefully people will enjoy my photos and download them if they would like. Im excited about that.   Today at lunch i watched "the screensavers". Awesome show, they were talking about the Matrix.I am so counting down to my trip.........3 more days till im outta here......  Johnny Cash singing "hurt"...awesome  And as always my JEFF BUCKLEY ROCKS!

      Sundays.......Lazy, oh god work is tomorrow days. Today i hung out with J all day, and we goofed off and played around. We watched T.V. for a bit then went to look at some furniture. When we went to Iowa, his mom had this love seat that was a recliner also. Very awesome, J and i fell in love with it. So now we are looking for one. We went and looked today for a bit, didnt find any that were as good as his moms, and were not under 700.00. So needless to say, it might be awhile, lol. We also went and watched the MATRIX. It was good, good graphics, and fullfilling for the night. Scares me to watch movies like that because they are so hiped up, that the movie is not all its supposed to be, yanno?   After the movie J and i went to the grocery store, and got some food for lunches to save money. I leave to go to Dallas this Thursday, im siked. Im also very excited to see Thomas on Thursday. He will feel more comfortable, for one, we will be in his surroundings. And for two, we will be passed the first meeting. I cant wait to see his work, i have been waiting for awhile. (note to self: frame for picture)....Getting his package together, so i can seal my part of the deal. Im soooo siked to go to Dallas, but know that when i get back, i will having nothing to look forward to, and that will suck.   I hope that Thomas is adapting to his job, and it wasnt such a sucky first day. I will have to admit that Thomas takes care of his stuff. He dosent have to get another job, nor support anyone besides himself. But he does, and even when times are tuff, he seems to have a smile about it. For that, i commend him, but cant tell him enough. I hope that his weekend was cool, and everything is smooth going.  Right now im watching Fast and the Furious, for the upteeth jillion time. Nothing like sexy men and badass cars to get a rise out of me, and keep my attention. hehe Bad Shelle.....Mika sits on teh floor looking at me, she is so cute. NO matter what time i might go to bed, she willl wait by my side, before she hits the sack.   BTW-Thomas.....There is a song by Norah Jones called the "Painter Song" might wanna check that one out!  I want to be more creative then what i am, and i want to breath ocean air. I need more time.....If there was a store that sold time, i think they would not be able to keep it in stock, and even so, i would always try to wait in line. I have no  time in my life to do anything. This is very frustrating. All i want to do is travel, and take pictures. Perhaps someday i could have a badass paying job that acquired the two? Who knows, i have also learned that i have to make things happen for my damn self. No one will help, or want to do it for me! I want to see Beth Orton in concert!  Top ten that i want to see in Concert! 1. Beth Orton 2. Jeff Buckley (deceased) 3. Aimee Mann 4. Norah Jones 5. Pete Yorn 6. The Who 7. GNR WITH SLASH 8. Lamb 9. John Mayer-----Counting Crows 10. Groove Armada  ok, ok, so cutting it down to ten is hard for me even, keep in mind they are not in order, just wrote down. For the sake of my sanity, i will have to see at least 2 of them. 2 Out of ten isent bad, eh?  So much to do, so little time. You know, people should enjoy there jobs, because you spend way more than half your life at work. And for what? To scrape by so you can have a little fun? Crap i have to get good at something, and i have to get good fast! While i am semi-young! SHit i have to start to do somethind! Gonna go to sleep and my eyes will be wide open thinking of such things........Nighty Nighty....sleep tighty tighty....  Oh yeah, Brother called today, wierd, but cool. It went safe, but scary.........ah shucks, just another Mo-Fo day...

      Its Saterday night.....But lets rewind for a time.....  Friday night after work I went to hang out with J, we were sitting on his porch and he asked me what i wanted to do. I answered, well i think we should just stay here and chill, save some money and just enjoy the company. As soon as i was done saying those words, the Tornado sirens went off. We looked at each other and went inside and turned on the tube. It was nasty and it was the first of it. There were about 3 heavy storms coming through. And the sky turned dark in a blink of an eye. The wind was outrageous! We watched for a bit, and started to pick out where we were gonna duck in the house. Then the T.V. said that two tornados had touched down CLOSE to my house. I freaked out, i knew that Mika was there alone, and didnt know what to do. I started to think about how little i played with her the night before. And how much i loved her. Its funny how wierd things start to go on in your mind, when you are put into a panic situation. I started to cry, and J was very helpful. J held me and told me that it would be ok, and that we would go get her.  I knew that it would not be safe to do so right away, i had to think of us. So we waited a bit and watched it on the tube, so we knew when it would be halfway safe. Then it hit me, what about Thomas? Is Thomas alright, was he in the path? I started to freak out about that. J and i went outside in the middle of his street and watched the skies. We took some pictures and went back in. We were starting to lose light, i knew that if we went we needed to go now. So i said, ok, lets go get her. We started on our way, and about 10 min later, we hit HUGE rain and strong winds. I told him to turn around, this was crazy! He just said .....no. And we continued. He told me to watch the skies and i did. All i could think about was the fact that we were driving right in the way, where they were. We seriously went right in the middle of the two storms. We got to the house, i grabbed Mika and we took off. We fought the rain all the way back.  He was hitting light after light, so he turned off a road and tried to take a short cut. He turned into this parking lot to turn around, and i yelled "ITS ALL WATER". He hit it and the water was at the top of the hood. He threw it in reverse, and i looked to the side, there was a bus. A bus was coming our way, he backed out and spun around. I would have to say that he did it very well actually. Like we were in a Fast and Furious movie. We finally made it back to his house, and Mika was releaved, along with her momma. The sirens were still going off when we arrived back, it was about 8:30 or so. The rest of the night we watched Tv, and i told him to go to sleep. He was sao tired and i knew that that was where he needed to be. So Mika and I went home.....  Saterday morning, i woke up late, and Lisa came over and wanted me to to Wal-mart with her. I went and played around with her a bit. Then we ended up going out to eat and watched a movie. (Daddy Day Care) It was cute and funny. But not one of my favs. Needless to say, that i watched it for her, hehe.    Have to go to the dentist, i am having problems with my back teeth!!! Shit, the last thing i need, and cant afford! Im hoping that i will be able to catch a money break soon. I didnt get to see J today, but talked to him a couple of times....... Thomas sent me an E mail, its good  to hear from him! Im gonna go moke, im getting off here!

      Went to the dentist, whew, not a good  thing. I have to get some work done, i have 2 cavities, and a tooth chipped. But i promise i dont look like im a true Arkansan! ha. It will cost me over 2000 dollers to get all the work done that i need, and that is with insurance helping! I have  shitty dental insurance. They dropped the original plan, and im stuck with this. What can you do? gerrrrrr.... How do they expect me to go in and pay 300-400 dollers a visit? Out of your mind is more like it...enough depressing info..moving along...  Things that are on the mind...  Mark Rothko Altoids- Tangerine Sours Ready-made and Nest Magazine Gardening When is my next trip? Money, but this will be on every list i seem to make!

      After a long day at the office yesterday i got to hang out with J after work. We really didnt do much, but in actuality it was nice. I sorda fell asleep, i never used to just slip into sleep, but for some reason i can do it so EASILY over there. I guess im comfortable over there. When i woke up J was watching a show on "FAT CAMP", on MTV. Where they show these kids going to camp, because they are over weight. Anyways, i was thinking, man have i got to get into shape. Just start, cant go another year being as fat as i am. Gerrrr, gimmie cup-cake.....  Went home, and a couple of buddies were over at the house, chatted and then soon went to bed. But before crashing i had to watch a little bit of  "Waiting to Exhale". It was on the womens channel, the whole Cinema Therapy deal. It is nice, because its relaxing and makes you crave things you dont have. Just like all those damn romantic movies! Who needs romance????(shelle raises hand) I DO DAMMIT.......  Crashed, closed the eyes, and thoughts about the days events, a few eye rolls and i was gone..Mika right beside me, watching me sleep. She is my secuirity blanket..hehe LoVe HeR..  Arose to face another day this morning, dont feel bad, just ready for the day. Got to work and i was busy from then till now. Its about 12:26.... Just got back from lunch. Went to lunch with Eric and J, yummy yummy, love that chicken from ?. you know the rest! hehe  Thomas has not logged in yet today, and that is strange, i see him bright and early every morning. He logged in for a second I noticed, while i was at lunch. And wrote a few lines too me, better than nothing at least i know that he is ok.  Havent seen much of J today, he has been busy and been in a meeting. The bog bosses here are in a tiff, whatever shelle says. heh  Dont really know what i have planned for tonight yet. But if i had plans, chances are they would change....humm. better not make plans. Heh

I just dont get people thats all, and that will be a question that will never be answered, so i guess i need to buck up and face it!   Talked to Thomas today, and J looks fucking awesome in his outfit!  In Total MARK ROTHKO MODE, i have to go to the museum of art in Washington. They have quite the collection!

      Where could Shelle start.........  Thursday....  J and I left and headed out about 4:15, and went to my house. I was going to surprise him with a package, but UPS had not been there, so we left and hit the road. We hit the road, and our first stop was Arkadelphia, for Thomas. We met up with him at Mcdonalds, and it was awesome because he brought his drawings in a book. So we ate we looked at his drawings, and that was fun. Thomas was like,  "lets play Rock, Paper, Scissors". Ha, i beat him right off the bat. (Shelle gets up and does Rocky dance). Than we played again and he won, shushhhh, shelle let him win. hehe  Then i busted out some Tic Tac Toe, yes yes, shelle wins that too.   We chatted for awhile, and headed off to his house. Wow, his stuff was awesome, all his paintings. He showed us his drawings and stuff that his friends had givin him. Lets say that Thomas has an awesome colllection of things. And has many talented friends as well. Thomas also made us brownies, now that was sooo cool. He made us brownies with little M&Ms in them. He rememberd what her liked....So sweet. Finally met Betty and his Mom, that was groovy too.  Left his house and head off towards Ricks place. We arrived kinda late, but chatted with them a tad and then went to bed. Got up the next morning and rick had to leave to go to work, J and I had lunch with Laura and the Kids. It was so nice, we sat out on their front porch and the rising sun to our backs. It was still cool outside and laura made breakfast. We sat and ate breakfast with the boys, and laura. Played around a bit, then took turns in the showers, and hit the road.   Ah, we were on the way to Dallas, and excited we were....We arrived and Mom wanted to take us out for lunch. We ate, and then hit up some museums. The Carter, The Kimbell, and the new Modern Museum. Wow, what a treat it was! I saw TWO MARK ROTHKOS, in the new Modern Mus. I was in awwww... All i could do was sit there and stare, and stare, and stare. I could not grasp the fact that i was looking at originals, in person....It was amazing, and that alone was worth the trip! After that we took mom home, and i took Jason on a little drive around town. I think that he likes the place alot. And that made me feel good, that he was having a good time. The next day we went back to the Carter and went to the IMAX Omni, watched a show called "speed" and had a great time there. We did some more driving around, and went to a bar with my brother, to see a blues band. It was neat, and had a good time. Kicked back a few, and realaxed.  Went to Dallas and drove around, hit Deep Ellum up and walked around a little. Drove around and took pictures of some of the buildings, and great stories were told. Sunday night we stayed at the house, and played a trivia game with Mom. It was trivia on 50 and 60s music. Instead of playing the game, I read the questions and Jason went against my Mom. It was FUN, and we all had a good time.   Monday morning we got up and went to breakfast with Mom, then headed out to the 303 mall. Jason racked up some clothes and i ended up getting some things as well. We said our good-byes to Mom in the parking lot then we hit the road back.   The drive back was nice because it was sooo nice outside. It was not hot or cold, just perfect. We hit a Adult Video store on the way back, and stopped for a few mins.  Hit the road again, and headed towards Ricks house. They were celebrating his birthday, so we stayed for a while. Played with the kids, told them about our trip, and then hit the road once more. This time we were heading towards Thomas's house.   Surprised Thomas, i could tell when he opened the door, but it was all good. I told him that we were hungry, and wanted to know if he would join us. So we all went to the Pizza hut in town, sat out on the patio, grubbed and ate. Sweet Sweet little moments. AFter awhile, yes yes, we hit the road again  Got home, hehe, naughty......sleep   (fence...moms yard)  Sorry its not more detailed, but my mind is mushy......Dentist appt. today!

      I have not heard from Thomas today, i think that i must have forgotten something that he might have been doing. I hope that he is ok, and things are going good for him on this Friday.   Today im so siked about me getting my new computer (flat screen monitor) at work. Jason really is stretched for time, yet he is still going  to hook me up. He rocks. This will also clear a lot of desk space up, and i cant wait for that. HE had to run out to Pinnacle Mountain and do a few things up there. Hopefully tonight Paddy will have gotten her computer and J and I can go over there to hook it up. At lunch i ran a couple of errands and did some (sneaky things for J).   The weather is drury, and its rain rain rain, but i kinda like it. I woke up this morning with the rain, and i for sure didnt want to get up! But knew that the faster i got up the faster the Friday would be getting closer to being over. At least thats my way of looking at it. We rented Adaptation last night, but didnt watch it, ended up watching the MTV movie awards. I have sucked Jason in to all that stupid crap that is on the TV, and he likes it.   Still reading Neuromancer, but it is quite a hard book to follow and read. But shelle is still trying, her can do it!  Tomorrow we will see Thomas and im siked. Get to go to the Museum and eat food and such! Cant wait. I dont want to forget that i have to get his movie back to him..........  Have to get to work.......till time allows me to write more....

      Last night was just off, J and i hung out but we were at each other here and there. And finally i broke down and told him, all i want to do is spend time with you. And your going in other rooms and staying in there and not talking to me. Left me in the living room and didnt say anything for about an hour to me at one time. So i got up and walked in the other room, and finally said with tears about to fall, that all i wanted to do is spend time with him. He has been busy at work, i have not seen him, and busy at night. Thats all i wanted was a little quality time.  Have been talking to thomas alot today, and i miss that. Even though i get supa-busy, still its fucking rock awesome to know that he is there to chat when i wanna. Other way around with J, but hes a busy man, i have to understand that. OR do i? Made plans to meet up at the arts center, and im siked! I get to see him and eat Mcdonalds, see im not high maintenence......  Today was a wierd day for men....I had two of them tell me that they think im sexy, and that im hot. Makes me feel good, but her knows the truth. One is supa-sexy and sooooo cute. But just a bud, and thats how i like it! sometimes.......heh

      Having a very hard time right now....  I was having a problem with my computer for the last 2 days. I had been without it because there was something going on, and it wouldnt turn on. I had made myself completly frustrated trying to figure it out. working on it for hours, and getting no where. I knew a few things that it might be, but had no idea how to fix it. I called J when i first found out about my computer problem, and he gave me a few vague things off the top of his head. I understood the fact that he wasnt there and that there was not much that he could do. So i let it go thinking that he might have some ideas for me tomorrow. The next day (today) i mentioned my computer still not working even though i worked  on it a couple of hours after i got off the phone with him last night. He said nothing...i blew it off.... I go home and mess around with it for about  2 hours, then give him a call. trying to tell him, that i noticed this and that, and i was really frustrated and getting nowhere. All he wanted to do was criticize the shit that goes on around me, and tell me how pathetic things are. So i said: " You want to know what i think is pathetic, you for not trying to help me, your sitting over there, and your not even making the attempt" And he said nothing, so i said bye and hung up. I hardly ever get attitude with J, but i was pissed at the fact that he does this shit for a living, and if im supposed to mean something to him, then help me! And he sure hasnt gone out of his way to help me.   After about 2 hours he shows up, i was shocked, and he shows up with a power supply. I know that he does not have the money to be doing thses things, and i totally appreciated it. And i wanted to hug his neck. He tried to fix my computer and couldnt. I plugged it back up after he took the new part out, and BOOM it worked. I dont know why and i dont know how, all i know is that it worked. And that was a relief. As i was pushing it back, i said "I hate this thing" then across from the room, i hear, "ok, well, see ya later" he was leaving, that pissed me off.  Granted i was mad about my computer, but i was mad that he acted the way that he did to begin with. And i was not over it yet. And then he just added to it. He walked out, i headed towards the door, i said: " so just like that, you are going to leave?"  His response was " Well your cranky" So i said ok, i was not going to beg him to stay. When he pulled away in his car, i watched him through the window, thinking about what an asshole he is, but there was a feeling of helplessness that he left me. Just knowing that he was no longer in the room, and no where close hurt me. I wanted to chase after the car, and tell him that i already miss him, and i dont want him to leave. But i didnt, i hit the door, said "asshole" and sat down.  Then i thought that i should call him, and leave a message on his machine about every feeling that i thought about him. But i knew that that was immature and i was pissed, adn didnt want to say something that i didnt mean. So here i am, blogging about it...Im such a fucking loser..sigh  I wanted to tell him that i appreciated what he did, and that he was very sweet to do that. But it was the fact that he didnt make a move, and wouldnt have thought about it until i told him that he was pathetic. I feel that he judges me way too much, and puts me in a spot that he is inferior to me. I dont know what to think anymore. Yeah, i am a women and my emotions are wierd at times. But i know that im not wrong about this, at least i dont think so?  I wish that he would have turned around, said that he was sorry, i would have said that i was sorry! mabye had said, are you hungry, lets go grab something to eat and talk! Why is that soooooooooo hard to find, or even ask for? Hey Shelle, lets go get some coffee, or talk to me Michelle. Simple, yet so f-ing hard to do! I dont understand!!!!  If he had chosen one of those, things would have been fine, and it would have been over. Just pull out some sensitivity, dont be an ass and run from what bothers you. gerrrrrrr   Im in the mood for Jeff Buckley, but mad at the fact that it reminds me of him. Mika and i are going for a walk.

      I really wanted to see Thomas over the weekend, but was pissed at myself that i didnt. I woke up early that morning to drive over to J's. Told him that Thomas was going to be in town, and i didnt have his number. J looked and he didnt have it either. We sat around wondering if we gave Thomas our number! Did we? Well he didnt end up calling so i will assume that he did not have our number. Ah-well perhaps he will forgive.   J's weedeater was stolen, im on the hunt for that person, and J has a new room-ate, only next door. The reason i say this is because it seems that we share the same thin wall in between us. Have seen little of him, so he is no pain to us, yet. Would like to turn J's yard upside down, would love to get in there and do some things. Sigh, everything takes money.  Things that are on my mind -J-wise-  Clean his yard and make it badass Take care of Sabina Get his carpet clean Where is my stuff gonna go? Do a little research on what makes him tick  I need to take Mika to the Vet, it seems that her breathing is not as good as it used to be, and that worries me. That takes money, fuck! I will sell crap in order to take her! Another things that takes money is my dentist, that is something that i need to do SOON. If i do anything for myself, its gotta be this.   I have lost 3 more pounds in the last week.....not on purpose, just dont know where i left it! Trust me, not to say that i dont mind it. If i could misplace pounds ( and not find them) then i would happy!   The weekend was slow and i have had better days, but i have to love them, for its my life i have to live-out.   Sorry i missed you Thomas Sorry i havent been better for you Mika i will get you there girl, i promise!                                                        Where did my money go? ShIt.......

      Just got home from hanging out with J, ah my sweet time in "what could be". He let me drive his car home last night, on of many i might add. So i was able to hop up this morning and run to pay my phone bill then i was on my way to the place where i seem to need. He was opening his eyes from his nights sleep when i arrived. I love to watch people sleep, not so much a fetish, just something thats cool to me. J looks like a pure struggling angel when he sleeps. Very nice. KInda like the type that you want to reach out and hold him, so he is safe. But at the same time would do anything not to move him, ah shucks. Today was a purly LaZy day for me, i couldnt sit still and keep my eyes open, quite odd. That dosen't happen to me often, i think its because i am go, go, go all the time, that when i do catch a break, my body will not let me up. We finally hit the road, and i had Shaved Ice all in my head. I had not had one in years, and wanted to feel like a kid again! We stopped and got two and sat and just chilled. We laughed and carried on. Then after we hit a couple of stores that were in the distance and browsed. J wanted to go rent a movie, and i was all for it. It was the ending to a semi-perfect day. We rented "Igby goes down" AWESOME MOVIE!!!! And the soundtrack, oh my...... Thomas needs to see this!  Speaking of Thomas and movies, J and i watched the one that he let us borrow last night. I didnt think it was a strange movie, just kinda slow, but mabye that was because we were both kinda tired and all the lights were off. zzzzzzzzzzzzz  But very good movie, i would like him to lend us some more!  J did a hot lap today when he took me home, i love it when he does that. We had a total sing-a-long it was awesome. Then when i got out, he gave me a very special peice of paper. Thank you Jason, it means more than you know! That shows that we have grown together.  Thats it for tonight.......  MIka says hello, Coldplay and Jeff Buckley ROCK my world.  Love the life that i can have, please give me the power to jump in.  DREAM: Thomas to paint me a HUGE picture. Ah, what shall i do..........

      Right now is a time in my life that i need to do alot of thinking about what i want to do, and where i want to go. If i had the money i would get my own place and just get my life together. Its really hard when you always have someone there and dosent give you much time to think about the things that you need. I have a problem of doing what others think i should do, or what they think is best for me. And then i never have time to think about what is best for me. I would like to move in with Jason and be his roomate, to help him out with bills and to keep him company. We hang out all the time with each other anyways, it sorda just makes sense. But at the same time i have feelings for Jason, and i dont want to move in and it not work, then we will lose our friendship. I love Jason with all my heart, and i dont want to move out and us not get along. We are both stubborn and hard headed, and sometimes we clash. But that is everyone and that is life. But if i were to take that big step and move in, and i find out that is not what i really want, then i lose Jason as a bud and a possible reationship. I dont want that to happen, so is there anyway around this situation? I think its kinda like jump in or drown. He keeps on me about moving in , and i have put him off way to long as it is already. Just scared, and dont want to lose what i have now, but the people around me are tired of me not knowing what i want. So its a chess move.....I dont know how to play chess.....crap  Jason makes me smile, and he enjoys my stupid humor. And every so often i think that he likes my Ghetto side. I love to hang out with him, and want more sometimes. But more, comes with a price, and im broke and for a loss of words.   On the other note Mika is well, and her knows that she might have a new home. A home without a fence, but we will work on getting that done as well. I would like to be alone and read and think about things. Turn on the music and relax and zone out as much as i can. My life dosent seem to allow that at this point. I would love to write and draw my thoughts and feelings, who knows mabye i will come up with something good!  I talked to Thomas today for a bit, he is busy still doing his drawings. Im glad that he has something to keep him busy, so he dosent get caught up in harsh reality so much. Life is what you make of it, what will i make of it. What will become of me? When i am 60 years old, will i be happy with the choices that i have made? Will never be able to know, until im there, that is the scary part.   One of the best feelings is when i shave my legs and i have a warm hand that slides down them. Or when i shave them and get under some new sheets...oh  yeah.... I love sweat covered bodies after and during sex, makes you feel that you are really into what is going on. I love to be told  that he loves me, or just plain talk dirty to me. I love music to be played or i love to simply hear the rain when there is a storm or a drizzle. I love soft looks, and healthy kisses. I love the act of full sillyness when you are in danger of crying together. Or an evening when every thing flows right, and there are no weird answers to anything. I love to sit outside when there is a slight breeze.   Sno cones are great when eaten together.......... Adopt a Honda? need more love and willingness...

      Last night it rained and rained hard, along with some hail mind you. The first thing i thought about was Sabina, so i called J up and asked him if it was raining over there. I should have known that it wasnt because i always get the bad weather, and j slips by with the simple stuff.   OK, someone at work  has total cuteness going for him, growl! But not my type, but i sure can enjoy is looks.  Mellissa from work asked me today if i was mad at her, i responded with a no. I told her that i had alot going on and that i was not trying to snub her. She seemed so thrilled when she found out that everything was cool. Its wierd, kinda makes me feel bad, but kinda makes me feel good. At least i know that they think alot about me to care if i am mad at them or not.   Last night was nice, i watched two shows on WE, Cinematherapy!!! I really am starting to love that channel. I watched " He loves me, he loves me not" with Claire Danes, wierd movie, but i could relate, that might be the scary part about it. And then the other movie i watched was "No looking back" it had Bon Jovi in it, and Lauren Holly. I could relate to that movie as well. And they really wernt that korny or sappy. So guys might dig it. But it was nice, to watch and think about "what if" and to read "Tropic of Cancer" by: Henry Miller....and read by Anais Nin....so you know its good stuff! eroticly smart reading. And with the rain pounding down on the roof and windows, it made for a pleasnt evening. I need more evenings like that, to myself, and get lost in endless romance.  I have been getting alot of E mails from Joni, her and Charity want to hang out, so i figure that it will happen soon. My mom has been sorda keeping in touch, and thats wierd, but accepted. I started to write a little last night, but didnt get far. I tried to do it in the middle of commercials.  Well lunch is almost here and i havent a clue of what to eat, i shouldnt eat much to be honest, her needs to lose pounds. Mika gives the wink, and we are good to go.   1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of  me, for I may not  follow. Do not walk beside me either. Just pretty much  leave me the hell alone.  2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and a leaky  tire.  3. It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal your  neighbor's  newspaper, that's the time to do it.  4. Sex is like air. It's not important unless you aren't getting  any.  5. Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced, you can't be  promoted.  6. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.  7. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple  of car payments.  8. Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their  shoes.  That way, when you criticize them you're a mile away and you have  their shoes.  9. If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.  10. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to  fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.  11. If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was  probably worth it.  12. If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.  13. Some days you are the bug; some days you are a windshield.  14. Don't worry; it only seems kinky the first time.  15. Good judgment comes from bad experience, and a lot of that comes from  bad judgment  16. A closed mouth gathers no foot.  17. Duct tape is like the Force. It has a light side and a dark side,  and it holds the universe together.  18. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your lips are moving.  19. Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.  20. Never miss a good chance to shut up.  21. We are born naked, wet, hungry, and get slapped on our  ass...then things  get  worse.    22. Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative on the same night.  23. There is a fine line between "hobby" and "mental illness."  24. No matter what happens, somebody will find a way to take it too seriously.  25. Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.   HAHAHA

      Dear Blogger......  my top is golden my vision is blue my smile is 400+ my chest is ocean blue my touch is flirty pink my rest is honey brown  Why do you ignore the passion that lays beside you, why must you see what you choose to be unable.The light behind you is getting dim and my eyes are failing. Do you reach for me, or allow your body to flow where the source is drawn.I no longer can see you, but i can feel your breath on my body. Not knowing where you are and the  thought of you brings chills to my very being. My skin is now bare and my eyelashes rest upon my cheeks. Do you need me as a whole, or do you just feel the need? Flirty pink in two places you would think that i have adapted to the neatness. Can you feel my softness, as you seem to judge me in the dark. I am who i am, strong as you thought. Do not test the taste of pureness, you may want seconds.

      Today the rain pours down on us starting last night. It will stay until the middle of next week as far as i can tell. I still have no computer at my house, and i am reminded when i have a good idea and want to get on and i cant. In due time i tell my self. Im trying to teach myself a bit of pateince, lets see if it works...  Last night i was stubborn as hell and J and i got into a tiff. I will admit that i was stubborn, but then just got plain pissed off. He told me to "shut-up" and thats all i have to say. Dont really feel like talking much about it, im passed it and that is what matters most.  Didnt eat and didnt eat much for lunch today, just some peanuts. He is very quiet today, but i understand that he is not feeling too good, so im letting it ride. Sometimes i seem to take things too seriously, im trying to work on that. Im trying not to let things bother me as much as i do, sometimes i just cant help it. Like J got some neighbors next door, well they park in his driveway and block his driveway when their friends are over. And at first they didnt ask, then mabye they heard me saying something to J about it. But then they asked like they should have. Its like i have no problem with them doing it, exept it was disrespectful to me when they didnt ask first. I would never pull in someones driveway and park without asking. But mabye that is just me. So i say nothing to J about that anymore and i let it ride. Besides it is not my house, so i really dont have any say so..... Sometimes i think that people run over J because he never says anything or puts his foot down. But gets mad at me when i try to help me. Am i turning into my mother? Oh shit, please say that im not.   Why does it always seem that i have the same old problems....No wonder no one reads this, i wouldnt either it would get really boring! Ha, crap i should mix it up a tad......I should do something like adventures in MIKA LAND. Ok, so mabye that would be just as bad as the same ole stuff.  I would like to sit and relax, watch the rain and listen to the beatles....... That sounds so good to me, mabye grab a good book. But i would like to zone out awhile before i started to read.   Right now im sitting at work, and i have a great view. Im watching Jason install a computer on the desk in front of me. Even though he says nothing, his presence is good. And that makes me feel good. I wonder why i feel that way, i wonder if he feels that way about me when i am near. He dosent act like it, so i was wondering if he did feel that way on occasion. Actually i could really care less about it. I do then i dont.   No word from Thomas...An E-mail I need to get a hold of my dad   Fathers day is just around the corner, and i have yet to call him. Although i dont plan on asking Jason if he wants to go up there. Im sure that he really dosent want to. I mentioned it one time, and he said nothing. Its his car and time, so i figure that if he really wanted to then he will mention it to me. I get tired of my shit being put on him, and all my crap for him to deal with.  Not to mention that since i cant afford to get my dental done on  my own, he put it on his credit card. He rocks in that sense, but it bothers me to know that i borrowed money from him. I hate that feeling, but i know that i would not have done it inless i couldnt on my own.  Im starving and didnt want anything at jasons house, perhaps i should hit the snack bar, nah, im fat enough....

       "A bit of fragrance always clings to the hand that gives the rose." - Chinese proverb    I love your lips when they're wet with wine     And red with a wild desire;  I love your eyes when the lovelight lies     Lit with a passionate fire.  I love your arms when the warm white flesh     Touches mine in a fond embrace;  I love your hair when the strands enmesh     Your kisses against my face.   Not for me the cold, calm kiss     Of a virgin's bloodless love;  Nor for me the saint's white bliss,     Nor the heart of a spotless dove.  But give me the love that so freely gives     And laughs at the whole world's blame,  With your body so young and warm in my arms,     It sets my poor heart aflame.   So kiss me sweet with your warm wet mouth,     Still fragrant with ruby wine,  And say with a fervor born of the South     That your body and soul are mine.  Clasp me close in your warm young arms,     While the pale stars shine above,  And we'll live our whole young lives away     In the joys of a living love.

      Thomas seems to be moving up in the world with everyone wanting his art. Im proud of him, and he deserves it none the less. There is a new eating joint that wants to have his work in there place. Thats really cool, and i would like to go there and take pictures of it up on their wall. That would be something that i would love to have done. Have my stuff hanging somewhere.....for people to gaze at in awkward conversations. I have not talked to him much recently, he has been so busy getting paintings done on a deadline. Gotta do what you gotta do. Makes me wonder what his mom thinks, i know that she is proud, but i would just like to see her thoughts from time to time. Im just like that though, i like to see what other people are thinking. May not like it though...eesh  Jason has been busy at work, installing computers and setting people up here and there. Pretty soon he will be rare when it comes to the every day office hours. He needs to get out in the parks and see the sun light, could be good for him. But might make him really tired when he comes home, cant win for losing sometimes. For someone that has the world by his finger, he sure seems to always have something on his mind. Just stop, breath in and enjoy...Smell the Java....  As for me.....Today i have a dental appt., im not looking forward to it in the least. Its gonna hurt for days after and i hate getting shots into my gums. Ee gads, im gonna have to eat at lunch, im not sure if i will for dinner. I passed up a better job than mine, well its a little better. I didnt put my app. in and i know that i prob. would have gotten the job. It pays better, not a whole lot, but more. I would only be going right down the hall. But i chickend out, i thought i would not have been good enough for the job. Turns out, i would have. Its too late for me to turn in an app. Yes Jason told me to do it and now im catching the heat from him about not trying. I do understand why he could be upset that i didnt try, but damn dont put me down about it. Its my decision, not his. I know now that i made the mistake, so let it go at that. Thank you...drive thru please....  Kens birthday is tomorrow, and i have no idea what to get him. He didnt tell me or give me a clue....so im gonna have to guess on that one.   Lunch lunch is all i can think about.....her hungry.....  Still loving my computer here at work........My computer at home is gone. My harddrive crashed on me, and i dont know why. Very frustrating and im pissed about it. All my pictures that i ever took since i had my camera were on there. I didnt have a back-up, i couldnt afford one with all my dental that has popped up on me. So there it is, i lost what matters most in my work. Lesson learned, sont attempt without a back-up. Stupid stupid stupid...  Fathers day is coming up and i need to figure out what im going to do about that. I want to go see him, but not sure if J is up to it Iowa is coming back..J has to go up there and upgrade his moms computer. So im excited about that.  My mom here also says that she wants her, my sister and I to head out to Tunica for the weekend. Take off Friday and come back sunday. A womens retreat. gamble gamble.......we shall see if i have the funds.

      Ok, so i have neglected my post, but not for as long as it could have been mind you. I have had no computer at home for 2 days now. I dont know whats wrong i just know that its not working. lol. There is somthing wrong with my motherboard or my Hard drive. Its Jason's work of art, so only the master hands can fix it. So her waits........   I got a badass computer at work, j hooked it up for shelle. Its the new Dell, pretty n black. Flat screen and quite keyboard and all the fixins, quite nice. I have waited long enough for it! Dont bitch michelle, be glad that you have it! Her is happy with what her has.....Jason always says nothings ever good enough for me.....not true...right?.... eh   This weekend my mom called and wanted me to tag along with her and the rest of my funny in the head family. I said ok, and so we went to "Toad Suck Park" and had some kind of family eat thing. If that is what you call it. Its not that my family is wierd, ok perhaps. We load up and none of us really speak to each other. Or when they do, they pry into my life, or talk about the other messed up people in the family. I sit around a table and have people come up to me and say: " this is your cousin, and this is, and this is, and this is.....Geez will these people stop having kids for fucks sake!  I have no idea who the people are, and they all look like they crawled right out of the closest trailer park. Kinda like that one episode off "punked". Im sitting there and they are all taking foil off the food that they brought. And its like they like to play games with there food (lets see who can figure this dish out). All the dirty faced kids gather around and scream about wanting some food NOW. There little fingers getting into one dish after another. Dropping food all over the ground, and there parents are all sitting together smoking and talking. They only turn around to say something after a peice of chicken hits their leg. Im sitting in the back with my mom watching the show..... Its not that im better than parts of my family, but damn, you would have to be there. This was sunday.....  Saterday... J and I met up with Thomas for the arts museum. We went to teh exhibit and it was cool, alot of good stuff was seen and it was a good time. I enjoyed sitting out by the water in the front. The sun was hot and the slight breeze from the water . Leaned back and stuck my hands into the running water and it was cool, and felt very good. Thomas was standing there, and seemed like he wanted to leave, but didnt want to tell us. I asked him about how he felt and he said that is was all good. So thoughts are replaced with good ones.   Friday, Saterday and Sunday i went to bed about 3or4 in the morning, its been tuff. I have too much going on in my head and i cant figure a god damn thing out. Must break free!  Dental appt. tomorrow, michelle please do not forget.... 50 Bucks if you forget.

      Today is Friday and i am happy go lucky to see it come. This week has been a long week and i am ready to do what i want again. Tonight i will be hanging out with Jason and i cant wait to get there. I want to sit on the couch and turn on the fan and just have a good time, relax. I try to not be in his face so much anymore, or follow him around. Not that i did it that bad from the start but im giving up on the "closeness" part of that.   The night before last i decided to give Jason a date, and not this friday but the next im moving in with him. I really will miss alot of things from where i am at now, but i want this bad enough to just go for it. That means that i will be getting another job, i also need to try and find some time to work in Jason's yard. I have to get some things done on Sabina, and i need a second job to pay for it. Things i need to a second job for:  A CAR Getting things done on Sabina buying nifty things for the house Paying bills education   Jason is still having problems with my computer and he dosent know what it is. He thinks that im not every happy with what he does, WRONG, i know how hard he has worked and all the time that he has spent on it. And i thank you Jason!  At least we have one working computer again!  Thomas asked me how i was going to be able to work 2 jobs and do Photoshop, i told him that i didnt know, but i was going to have to. I never thought about it like that until he asked me. But i will just have to buck up and do it. I cant get what i want where i am now, so its time for a change. I will have to work my ass off, but i want a DAMN HONDA! Everyone says, I cant be picky, i may have to get something else first. NOPE, i want what i want and i will work my ass off to get it. Although i will be tired as hell.  Cookie dough, blind date, and a fan with someone beside me playing with my hair! That is what i want!

      There is so much heat for the ones we love, its you and me, you wont be unhappy. Keep running up that road, keep running up that hill. Come on baby, come on darlin, let me steal this moment from you now, lets exchange the experience.  sigh>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  Bicker Bicker Bicker is all i seem to be good at now a days, and evern then sometimes i fail. I think that Jason has to many things that he does not like about me. He complains and gripes about the things that i do or dont do. ugh...almost really hard to go on sometimes. But i love him and that is what keeps me going on, and im sure that it is the same thing for him about me. He is tired of waiting and i dont blame him a bit. But when i dont know what i want, im not going to rush into something and then be sorry later. So i have to make sure that everything is thought over thru and thru. If he dosent want to wait until i feel its right, then i dont think i need to move in because he is not respecting my side of it. And then in haste he tells me "well then i think you should just forget about it". And that is where i stand as of right now. Eh, there is so much that i can say right now, but my mind wants to give no effort towards it.  I talked to Thomas more than i have recently today, and that kicks ass. He has been a busy little bee, but i like it when he talks to me, so i know what is really going on in his head. I like to hear his stories of his past, and i listen close. I learn from him, and he takes me into imaginary  places that i dream up in my head. I have been very busy at work, and i hate that i cant just talk talk talk, but i wanna.  I like to hear about the places that he has visited, because ive never been there. So i sit back and think about what it might be like. His experiences are pure and good to hear. He listens too, and asks questions like he really cares......Ah breath, thomas  Sam has really moved up his game, and he is supa sweet... Stacey has been supa sweet..... and that is a change....  Stacey found my smut book, and he looked like "why not me"..... IN MY PURSE I MIGHT ADD JABA the Kelley cuts my ciggs in half, bitch slap coming for her.  And Jason buys all kinds of stuff for my new computer, he is so sweet, but gets irritated with me to damn much. I couldnt even stay in there and watch him put it together. bah  I miss sabina.....

      Im only happy when it rains....... All i can say is that my life is pretty plain, but i like watching the puddles gather rain.....  The rain beat loudly on the roof as i slightly opened my eyes to see what time it was. It was 5:27 in the morning and the lightning danced off the curtains and onto the walls. Mika was curled up close to me with her little eyes closed and quick little movements in her paws. She was dreaming and i dare not wake her, after all its the good dreams that someone or something usually wakes us from. I layed my head back down on the pillow and prayed that i would get some more sleep.   When i woke it was still raining and a little  morning light showed through the window. I  thought to myself that i better get up because i had Jasons car and it was raining. I didnt want to be strapped for time, and i wanted to call him when i got to work, so i can tell him that i made it ok. The roads were worse that i expected, they were nothing but water, and all i could do was cuss about how stupid Arkansas Roads were. They were not made right and are in need of desperate attention! I turned up the music, and listened to Beth Orton as she put some sort of calm back in me. Hummed, and tapped my foot the rest of the way to work.   Got to work and i was having some problems with my computer. The default page was not wanting to load all the way, and was getting testy not wanting to work after several reboots. My programs were not wanting to respond and shutting down on me. I went to my dentist appt. and she said that there was a vast improvment on my teeth because i was flossing. I never knew that it was that importnet to floss, 400+ dollers later i realize that it is. So for you who do not floss, you better stop by a store tonight on the way home, and grab some floss! The rain was still bad on the way and back from the dentist, streets were still flooded and people acted like they were daredevils, or complete apricots. ( for those that do not know what i mean by apricot, it's a pussy)   I got an E-mail back from Jason, and he is fine but wont be back before 5, so i will go to the house and wait for his return. I will be excited to read some more of my book! I got a new book, and its awesome! Its called: "The Sexual Life Of Catherine M." you should check it out. I have had it for about 2 days now and read every chance i have gotten.I kinda made Jason read some of it to me, i like how he reads, heh.   The plants on my desk are doing good, mika is at home sleeping under the recliner, and im at work watching the clock.....Need some J-Bug........  Talked to Thomas, he has some people coming over to check out some of his work today, damn he has been so busy. We dont talk like we used to, but that is how things go. I would like to see him again, and to be around him. Hes very comfy, but can put you in a wierd mood real quick. I need some realease of the times that are current, and have no clue how to get that just yet.

      ok, ok, hating jason, but just came across this........  I asked him a question, and this was his response! I actually teared up on this one, shush. So mabye hes not so bad, (ahem)!  This is the question:  If you had 50 dollars, and you are going to die tomorrow, but you are told to buy 5 things. What would you spend it on?  This is the answer he gave: 1 medium pizza hut deep pan pineapple pizza - $12.00; 1 2 liter of mt dew - $2; 2 pm tickets to market street cinema  $13.00; 1 bottle of cheap but good wine - $13.00;  fancy keychain for shelle to hook keys of the Honda to  up to $10.  Date with shelle during last night on earth - $priceless.

      Lunch did nothing but piss me off! I would like to stick my whole foot up jasons ass. First im irritated, so he wants to know why im acting so wierd, because it has only been a couple of hours since i have had a cigg. Yes some of it is in my head that i cant have a cigg, so i make it harder on myself. But Jason wants to act like such an ass when he tells me things, like hey my name is jason and i DO know everything there is to know. I wonder if it has occured to him that its not the same for everyone to try and quit! Then i try to fix some pizza in the oven, takes forever, and lunch is not that long. But its finally ready, i put it on a plate and sit down to eat it. My mouth is watering, but figure i really have to use the restroom. So i get up and the pizza slides off the plate right on the floor! Didnt even get a bite, i pick it up and throw it in the trash. I will just do without. Dont talk to Jason the rest of the lunch, i didnt really care too. Got in the car and i decided that i was not going to have a smoke. Jason lights one up and trys to give me the " you dont have to quit cold turkey" speech. And im not, because i know that i cant, i just tried to prove to him that i can do it. I always try to prove shit to him, im tired of it. If he does not like me for who i am and my downfalls and disfunctions, then BAH!  Im know that im mad because i am trying to quit smoking, he has to understand that. But im not going to expect him to take any abuse either. And then when we get back to work, we are getting in an elevator and he checks out  this chick before the doors closed. I wanted to beat his ass right there in the elevator. I mean im talking about throwing him up against the walls! I am not good enough for him, he checks out chicks all the time, in front of me or behind me or without me, it makes no diffrence. What an asshole! Thats ok though, i may not be what he wants, but i can get something else easily!    (note to readers) The next posts might be angry posts till the newness of no bimps gets out of my head! thank you, drive thru.

      Monday Monday.......  This weekend was nice, Friday night i hung out with Jason, and Saturday i had an outdoors day. Saturday i got up hung out with Char, Mike, Jason, Staci, Ken, Chris. We rode four-wheelers and cooked out in honor of Kens birthday. I had a real good time. I spent all day outside and it was a nice change.   I went to tan, i figured that my mom bought me 10 tans, so i might as well use them. I had not been there in awhile, so i walk in and they say that the beds are open for me to just go right in. Well i walk into the room, and there are all these colored peices of paper that are taped  to the wall by the light-switch and on the doors. They were not there last time i went, so i was curious to see what they said. I was shocked when i read this one " Please do not pee in the trashcans, we do have restrooms". I read that and looked around for the trashcan, that was sick. Then i started thinking, should i tan here? It sounds nasty, but this place has always been real nice and picked up, clean if you will. So i tanned and went on. But i was thinking, why didnt they just take the trashcans out of the room, instead of putting those signs up? People may read those signs and decide that its not very clean, and stop going. I think that they should have just taken it out of the room. But thats my opinion.....  Sunday i woke up rather early, its fathers day! I woke up and called Jason and asked him if he wanted to hang out. He seemed non intrested and not very excited to hear from me. I guess i expected a tad more seeing how i didnt see him yesterday and never called. I was going to call, but figured that he would just think that i couldnt go a day without him. I even did the whole phone in hand, his number halfway dialed deal. Anways he was acting strange, so i said, "well mabye we shouldnt hang out today" he said "ok" and hung up. SO no, im not going to call him after that. He was rude and i would rather stay at home by myself then to hang with that. Ken had gone to play golf and i was left at home with no car. There was no food in the house and i was almost out of ciggs. I called my mom, keep in mind that i hardly ever call my mom to do me any favors. But i called and asked if she would come pick me up and take me to the gas station. She said that she would after she was done eating, i told her that it was fine. About 10 min after i hung up with her, the phone rings, and its Jason. Keep in mind that this was like 3 or 4 hours after he hung up on me, but for him thats good. Im surprised that he called back period! He said that he was sorry and that he was not awake yet, although i dont really get that. Even if im not awake, i would still get excited that i can hear someones voice that missed. Perhaps that is why im a women, and all fucked up. Or perhaps that is why he is a man, and cant deal with emotions very well. That age old question "why do men and women think so diffrently?"  Anyways he ended up picking me up and i was hungry so we went to Wendys and i munched on a salad. I really wanted something else besides a salad, but Jason was like "do you want something healthy, or something not healthy". Sigh, that means that i have to get the damn salad, or the whole time i eat, i will feel like a fat ass. He makes me feel like that, he does. So i munched on the lettuce while he ate what i really wanted to eat. Oh well, easy to forget.  Then we went to the Home Depot and then went back to the house to chill. We watched some TV and i read a little William Gibson. Then we decided that we wanted to go and watch a movie, by this time we were hungry again. So we went and ate at Quiznos, first time there, and i dug it! Im not sure if Jason liked it as much as me, but he wasnt sick over it. He told me that my posters were ready, the cinema called and they have them ready for me. I got a poster of  "The Pianist" and "Frida". 20 bucks a pop, kinda high, but i wanted them none the less. Frida, Thomas still has not watched, gerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. So we went to the theater and picked up the posters, and ended up watching a film. We watched " The Mighty Wind", it was good. I think  that "Best in Show" was better, but this was still good.   Before we went to the movies we ended up going to Barnes. Telling myself as Jasons finding a parking spot, that im NOT going to buy anything, that money will be getting low soon. We went in and Jason pointed out a book to me that was laid out on the table. It was a book that i can remember he mentioning to me, and pointing out months ago. Come to think of it, he never bought it. I asked him why, he said that it was too much at the time and he couldnt get it. But now it was like 11 bucks, so i snatched it up. I started to read a little of it in one of the comfy chairs in the middle of isles. The guy across from me, looking up from his book often to take a peek. I let him, not bothering him back, but soon just got full fed up. I went to find J and tell him that i was going to check out. I was thinking of getting coffee because i always do, i love it, but didnt. I had the money on the mind. The book had me tuned in fully, and i couldnt put it down. I stepped outside to read and smoke. BTW- the book is "The Sexual Life of Catherine M." very good, erotic, and fun. I love the detail that she goes into about everything, and i cant keep my hands(oops) eyes off it. When i got home, that was all i did, i read, and read till my eyes got sandbag heavy.   Today i am starting to wing myself off ciggs, i am cutting down off my breaks and trying to not think about it at all, and yeah, its hard. Im chewing on gum sucking on this and that, and getting edgy. I hate to be Jason in this time of irritation. Mabye i wont be so bad.  Oh yeah, "The Real World" is in PARIS! I am having so much fun watching it because i get to see the sites of Paris, in its today fashion.This is a good thing for me, and im happy!  Mika says hi, as she waves her paw........  I need a bimp...shit!  Have heard little from Thomas, he needs to get sleep.

      Well, as you can see i am back to blogging at night again......I have not moved in yet, but i am still here tonight, until he takes me home. I just got through cleaning and sort of setting up my room. It looks good and im back to be excited, then depressed. Although im not going to say it will not come back. But for now, i have a smile on my face.   When i came over here today after work, i found a package in the mail from Thomas! YOU ARE SO SNEAKY! I loved it. I listened to it and layed on the floor and just zoned out, it was awesome. You need to write me a playlist, because i want to know who these people are! I reconized some but there are some that i draw a blank. I was in Total Groove through out this CD. Thomas rocks when it comes to his choice of music. I played the cd twice back to back. Then jason wanted to watch the basketball draft, so i was nice enough to stop groovin! The other day Thomas had jenny bring me a carmel latte at work. I cant even think about how cool that was. I was so surprised and it was awesome to see her again. He is as sneaky as me.......I have to start making him some cds because there is alot that i want him to hear!  My new case is up and running, and oh my wonderful! Thanks J-Bug! It has a clear side so i can see everything on the inside as it runs. Im going to get some purple neon lights to go inside. It will be a Shelle night light. This is so wierd to have Jason right down the hall. A geek to be disposal! I need to get a shirt that says.....I love my geek!  Jasons dad called tonight and said that he would fly Jason and i to colorado for a week! And put us in our own little apartments. I am worried about flying, i love to fly...But have not flown since Sept 11. But im going to buck it up and go!!!! Im excited...a whole week in colorado and fly there for free! Oh yeah, a nice break!  Im trying to get on the phone and call my mom, to tell her about the news!  Anyways my computer over here is back up and running....good to know for those that want to know!  :>)

      Wow, the new blogger is quite awesome, they did a little tweaking and came up with something to smile about. The only complaint that i have is that the "new post" page does not load all the way down by the calender. Not even a refresh will do. But something that is alot nicer and i had to work none in the process, i would say that is mighty ok. Besides it might next time...  I know that i have been slacking off in the blog portion of my life, but Thomas keeps on about it, so i always seem to come back. I have pretty much done most of my packing, and im ready for it to be over with. Its a sad situation but something good is sure to come of it. I need to get a Uhaul truck asap or Saturday, when i want to move there may not be one there. That is me thinking that everything is at my disposal. But im trying to stay ahead of the game if not on top of it at least. I dont think Mika really knows that we are moving yet, but i guess she will find out soon enough.  Last night i was a lazy bum, i did some packing, but i mainly sat on my ass and watched the tube. I read and cleaned up a tad, but i was not full force like i was the day before. I was so thirsty about 10:45 last night and did not want water.(although it is what i need) So Mika and I went to the store. I cant leave her in the car because she barks and goes crazy when i leave her. She is a mammas girl.... So my hair was wet from the shower that took place about 15 min earlier, and i had some PJ bottoms on with a shirt, no bra. I put my purse on one arm, and had Mika on the other. No make-up mind you, so that was bad enough, lol. So Mika and i went into the store to grab some drinks. I paid for them and grabed the bag and walked out. There was a cop coming in as i was going out, and he smiled and said "Is that a palmerainian?" I replyed: "yes". He came over to pet her and started talking to me. He was young, looked about 26 or so, very good looking. I was ashamed, i always told myself not to go out looking like white trash, because you never know who you are going to run in to. So We were chatting, he asked me where i lived and why he had never seen me. And how long he had been on the force and what not. He ended up asking for my number! Wow, i was thinking he wants my number and i look like total crap. I would have understood if he was not so appealing to the eye. But he was very nice looking, built body, blond hair with blue eyes and he had never been married with no kids. I was not giddy or anything, when he was talking i was thinking to myself "i must look like crap, just go'. But i told him that i couldnt give him my number, but it would be nice to see him around some time. And mabye he will let me off for speeding! lol.  This morning early is rained, and it rained its little heart out. So today is a dreary day, but kinda nice. Lunch is almost upon me and im glad, im starved!  I have not talked to Thomas much today so far, but i have majority of the day ahead of me.

      My moms advice on me moving out......   It is just like I discovered in life  -  Your life in the 20's is an ever changing facet as you are trying to grow which is why I have always recommended not getting married until you are close to 30.  You are still discovering your values, goals, etc.  You have to "Know thy self" and what you are about  before you can make a permanent commitment and you are still in the progress of learning and finding your way.

      Tuesday or bluesday  Today i am  in a quiet mood for some reason, cant really put a finger on it, just am. Days like this i just sit back and watch other peoples actions and think about the concerns in my own life. For lunch today i had Chicken noodle soup and some Orange Strawberry Banana juice from *Dole*. I love that stuff but its 130 calories in a 16 fl oz bottle, but oh so yummy! Dont know what is for dinner, hopefully some subway.  Work has been such a bore latley, but i dont think its work, i think its me. because nothing at work has changed, it might be that i have so much to do and i am ready to just get it over with.   Its so wierd that i dont have much to talk about or mabye its the mood that i am in, eh, .....  Talking to Thomas has been good today and i am glad that i was able to meet him~

      Today is a Monday .....since my computer is ill, i must catch up my weekends on the monday that follows!  Saturday.... I woke up and went to hang out with J for awhile, we did some running around and we went to Home Depot to get a key made for shelle. He even let me pick the color key that i wanted, so nice. So its official if im getting a key made and stuff. Im excited but a little skittish, but her get over it. I have moved about 2 box's over there so far, but that isnt even a little dent in what i need to do. I need to rent a Uhaul and get my furniture over there, but im sure that will be on Friday. Eh, i hate moving.... Im trying to start over in a way, be better towards my body, and lose some weight. Im going to get a second job, so i can afford a new car, or used. Study my butt off to better myself mentally, and have J-bug there to help me. It really is a big step for me, but this i will have to do. I want to just know that i can do it on my own. I want to say that i have done this, and not worry about what it would be like to do so, when i am 40. Kinda like something that i need to get out of my system.   I am leaving the life that i have had for about 3 years now, and that is hard enough as it is. I cry on occasion and just remind myself that its something that i want to do, just hurts to do it. I have to stay strong and buck it up, or else i will be where i am three or five years down the line, and never had moved a step. I had to face reality and make a move before i get buried. When you want something done you have to do it yourself, eh.  Sunday....  I woke up and J dropped me off at the tanning place, so i could hit it for about 30 min. Then he surprised me by a clean car with some pizza in the back for lunch. We went to his house and munched on some pizza and watched the tube, he mowed. Then he took me home and i relaxed and got some more stuff together. Lazy sunday, as they should be.  Monday.......MOnday.....MONday.....MONDay......MONDAy.....MONDAY  Here i am, half the work day is over and im happy about that for sure, ready to get outta here. Today has been busy as Mondays normally are. I have been able to talk  to Thomas quite a bit today, he has made em laugh something hard and for that i am thankful. I miss it when he bought me those flowers, that was so nice and such a treat! eh, i guess that was a one time deal. Made me feel pretty and speacial.  No one ever buys me things like that, and it was a supa nice change. Today for half my lunch, Jason, Eric and myself went to Bale Honda.....God i want the Honda S2000 so bad, i almost had to grab a towl, it was Awesome. only about 33 grand. Ah yeah, to dream in a world that makes you feel you cant. I will have a badass honda one of these days, its a goal, and it will become a reality. Hint hint, the second job thing!  Tonight i will be going home to gather more stuff up and get ready for my move.   Im worried about Mika too, I hope its not hard on her, she is used to where she is at. I will have to deal with that...Need to get her some Heart worm medicine!

      Still trying to get the house together and all settled in, we are alot closer than 2 days ago thats for sure. Its still very new to me and im not all adjusted yet. Mika is getting better about being there and my fish, well, she is happy too.  It has been humid here and i sweat, but it makes me feel like im dropping a few pounds! Ha...  The Fourth of July is coming up and Jason and I are going to a Party at Dans. Joni and Charity will be there and i love there company, we are all alot alike. I invited Thomas and Jen and i hope that they can make it. ALthough Thomas said that he may not be able to make it because he needs to work on his paintings. I didnt want to give him my opinion but i felt that he should go for Jens sake. I would not want her staying at home by herself. She could always hang out with me but Thomas and her pretty much grew up together and i know that it would mean alot to her. But i can understand that work needs to get done as well. Im outta of it, its really none of my bizznazz.  Just got through talking to Jeremy and he is quite the person, he is going to the beach for  the fourth of July. He is the only smoker so i can imagine what his trip will be like. Sam is staying here and going to some partys im sure. He is so handsome, and funny to me. I hope that i see everyone back here again, seems that this holiday takes alot of lives every year.   Today for lunch Jason and Eric and I are going to eat some chicken, i love going to lunch with eric he is so funny. The way he lives, its just funny, you have to know him! Work has been ok this week, nothing fancy and nothing really new, just trying to keep myself busy. I have been eating Fruits and Veggies for every meal, and last night i wanted the Olive Garden. I love that place its my fav.... It was good, service was not so good. And just as we were wrapping up the meal i saw one of my old bosses. When i first moved here i lived with my mom, and the ice strom hit. I had been working there and i was a good employee! I called in to say that i could not make it because Trees were down blocking the roads and we didnt even have power. My mom told me that she was not chancing it and that i should call in. She fired me because i could not make it in. She said that they were busy and she needed someone. And then she told me that i wouldnt be able to work at other Wal-greens. Whatever! She is such a bitch, all the other managers there did not like her either. About a month after she fired me, they transfered her to another location. I went back in to drop some film off and several managers asked me to come back. I already had the job that i am at now, but that goes to show you she was a bitch.  Anyways, when she came in to the Olive garden last night she saw me, and bent her head down and said: "she is such a bitch" to her man. He said: "who" then she looked at me and so did he. It was an whisper and eye fest for about 15 min of my meal, until i left. What an immature women. She is like thirty something and is a manager at wal-greens, and her man is a manager too! Ha, im sure that their parents are proud. Im the better person, but it still chapps my hide! As we got up to leave and we passed her table she was staring, i turned around to look back at her and she was still watching me, she saw me stare at her, and all she could do was hang her head. She didnt say or do a damn thing.   After that Jason and I went and rented "punch drunk love" with adam sandler. It was a off the wall fucked up movie, but good! I didnt sleep very well last night, i woke up twice during the night and struggled to sleep again. Mika was even crashed out and seemed to be rubbing it in, ha.   Im going to get off here I need to see my sister and go tan sometime. Get the house finished too!

      Here i am posting again, for some reason we had problems here at the house and i lost my blog. This is an old house and if there are two many things running at once, it seems to be too much and it trips the breaker, and it really sucks! Tonight is my second night here in the sauna. I hope that mabye with me sweating like i am, perhaps i might lose a pound a day or something, ha. Its not J's fault and thats why i really dont like to say much about the heat, im sure hes tired of hearing it! And he is a yankee, what the hell, why does this heat not bother him? I know that he has been here alot longer than i, and might be used to it, but damn. When you sit in your room, and then get up and the front and back of your shirt are sweaty, whew. It will just take me awhile to get used to it i guess, i also worry about Mika with the heat. She is not used to it either, and there is no air running during the day when we are not here. When i get some extra cash im gonna buy my own air conditioner for my room.  Thomas called me today and i was happy about that, it was good to hear him and talk to him on the weekend. He was busy but took the time to get a hold of shelle. We chatted for awhile and then i had to go. Ken also called, i talked to him for less than 5 min.  Its trying to rain here and it seems nice outside, i took a short walk, and jason didnt want to walk anymore because it was sprinkling. sigh, i wanted to walk in the rain, its refreshing! He has been nonsociable since i have been here. Well sorda, he stays in his room alot and dosent come out or say much. So i am left to do whatever, and im still getting used to that fact, because when we just hung out we were always doing something together.   Went and bought groc. today and im seriously flat broke now, ah well nothing new there. I have about a hundred bucks for 2 weeks. Time for me too seriously pinch the pennies! Mika may not eat this week, ha, that was a bad joke! Her would never go without food!!!! Thomas has never met Mika, oooh that has to happen. Mabye he can come down soon.......  Im going to get off here and watch the tube for awhile, jason is in his room and mika and i will surf the channels! :>)

      OMG i could seriously kill at this moment in my life......My AOL story has begun  Since i moved in with Jason, i no longer need AOL. So i called and got transfered like 3 times, finally got to the right person and she pissed me off. And i will start my story from there.   (Rachel) - a bad bad accent with no clue what so ever (shelle) - only wants one thing, ASAP  Keep in mind that she has already ticked me off and you are coming in the middle of the conversation~   Rachel: Ok, Michelle why do you want to cut your service with us? Shelle: Does it matter? I just want my service cut off and thats it. Rachel: I need to know why you want to cut your service off. Shelle: Look here, I hate spam, the connection is slow, i hate pop ups, and because i have to go through crap like this! I have DSL, so i no loger need AOL! Rachel: (smirky voice) Humm, shows here that they dont offer DSL in your area? DO you have DSL? Shelle: I moved, people do that you know. Look, all i want is for my service to be cut off please. Rachel: Well, do you know that for 9.95 you can tie your AOL in with DSL? Shelle: I dont want to do that, i want it cut off. Rachel: You are a valued customer, and have been with us a long time. So we have offers that we can offer you. Shelle: (finding it funny that NOW they want to offer me offers) I dont want that, i just want my service cut off. Rachel: Well, for 2.95 more a month, we can help you out with long distance. Shelle: Rachel, are you listening to me, are you reading off a card? No wonder people dont want to stay, they have to deal with this crap. If you losing my buisness is putting you in a bind, then you are not doing something right! Could you please just give me my confirmation number! Rachel: Have you tried to quit our service before, how do you know that we give confirmation numbers? Shelle: Everyone gives confirmation numbers Rachel!!!! Please cut off my service that is all i want, no deals, just a yes or no, that tells me that you have done this! Rachel: Fine, hold please while i get your number......(She comes back on with a laugh in her voice) For 8.95 a month we can connect you with Yahoo and tie AOL in with this. Shelle: RACHEL, are you laughing at me????? Rachel: No, no, no, im not (smirk) ok, here is your confirmation number Shelle: THANK YOU !!!!!! Rachel: you do know for 19.95 a month you can..... Shelle: CLICK!  I probaly forgot some stuff, its hard to remember and write down again.

      Last night i was so gone, i got off work and not even 15 min after i got home, i crashed. Didnt do a thing! When i woke up this morning, it was a weird feeling, like i have missed things. I didnt feel refreshed it was like i was in a daze, but im coming out of it. Jason jissed pissed in my tea with attitude. It started with someone asking about having lunch with us, YESTERDAY. And he didnt tell me until today wheni asked him about having lunch with someone else. But i let that slide, even though he would go out of wack over that situation. Then Laura and Him were instant messaging me about eating lunch today. I was super busy, was not even at my desk half the time and didnt know that they were talking to me. I am up at the file cab. when he walks over and gives me a look and points to my computer. This was a attitude look, and i said, i have been busy, havent seen it. And he said "its a simple yes or no". So i said "well mabye i shouldnt go" and he said "ok". SO that is where is stands. Something so stupid and childish, but yet this is how things go on around here. So Laura, Eric and him can go to lunch and i shall stay here. Dont need that crap.  Just shit that he does to me all the time, he gets his panties in a wad, when it happens to him.  I have talked to Thomas alot today and thats awesome. Im going to get to see him tonight at the movies. He just informed me that Jen is now going, thats awesome. So it will be Thomas, Mary, Jen, and Michelle. I cant wait to see the movie, i have not watched a scary movie in awhile. Jason does not like scary movies, so i have neglected to watch one.  I am in a good mood, and i hope to stay in one. I hope jason gets over his attitude and is nice. Sigh  Sarah came to me about getting a new Palm. I would love to i truly would, but Mika is enough. I have to think Responsible and not full emotion.

      Another day, another penny... and the world continues to turn.   Last night i stayed up till about 2am, i was finishing Thomas's cd and chatting with him online. He invited me to hang and watch a movie with him this Saturday. I will go and watch it with him and some girlfriend of his Mary. It should be fun, no doubt. I am  not pleased with how His cd case turned out, but if i dont send it, im afraid that it will not get sent. So, about 3 min ago, i put it in the mail.  This morning i got up and headed for the gym, at 5:30 AM, damn, im tired. I sure did though, got up and worked my big butt off. The snack shack here at work orders do-nuts every morning, and my fav do-nut always seems to make the cut. The soft glazed do-nut with the lemon filling. The big ones, oh man they are so good, and i havent had one is quite  the while. When i get my water every morning, i see it.   For security reasons the do-nuts name and the wanter's name has been changed........... We will call the do-nut~ Frank the wanter~ Selma   Selma gets up and scratches her head, her long BROWN hair covers her eyes and she is slightly awake. She remembers having a dream, a dream about things that she dare not talk about any other time. Lemon filled Do-nuts by the name of Frank jumping over fences and taunting her till no end. As they jump they leave little drops of filling everywhere. Selma says to herself "someone should clean that up, someone could slip and fall". She comes a little closer to the dreams cream, as she bends down to start the "cleaning process", she stops herself. I cant do this, its just not right, something feels wrong. She runs away, and does not look back.  What a strange dream Selma says, as she gets up to get ready for the day. She heads to the gym, and as she walks on the treadmill, she can only think bad things about herself, as she sees her reflection in a window. She trys to free her mind as she listens to a mix cd that was made not two days prior. Sweaty and Tired she heads back to the house for a shower and clothes for work. Slema reaches work and heads toward the snack bar. The snack bar is a Little space that was dug into the side of a room with two nonappealing windows at the entrance. A board sits in right behind the windows, that always tells  the speacial "guess what" food of the day. A black board with colorful pen writing on it, like they allowed there kids to pratice before taking them to school. The people that work there are people that have seemed to have the worst life, and it shows in their apperance. Hair nets are a must, and it is required for a blind person to work there and run the show. Right behind the blind person is a old Black and white TV with everyones reflection in it as they step up to the counter. I have no idea where the camera is, prob, right under the TV. The camera is for the Lady with the eye illness to keep track of her customers! wha?.. Selma grabs the Styro-foam cup from the huge spring container and heads toward the ice and water. She turns to go to the counter, and there it is! In the Plastic container just like in my dream. Its FRANK, and hes staring at me. The Jelly that over flows from the top turns into a shape of a finger and directs Selma toward him. No Frank,  Selma yelled! Every hair net in the place turned towards the scene that Frank was making. Selma backs up slowly, she hits  the Breakfast buffet portable island. It moves and she struggles to maintain balance. She falls and the floor is cold to her. Frank comes running at her, and jumps on top of her. Rubbing his filling all over her, and his glazed softness touches her skin. Selma dosent know if she can take it. She says "NO" and wacks him with her ID badge. She regains her footing and runs out of the snack bar.   Back at her desk, she thinks about what happend, and the softness of Frank. She really wants him, and wants to taste him. Selma knows  that she must be strong, and the day will go on. Breakfast at its best~

      Last night i went over  to my sisters after work and vistited with her, BJ and Elizabeth. Elizabeth is talking up a storm, she is so sweet. SIS told me that when i pulled up she went running for the door saying "shelle" "shelle". As i approched the porch outside the house, i could hear her little feet justa running! I gave Melissa her picture gift that i made her, and she about cried. She said that she might take it to work, but that she was going to put it in a fancy frame. That made me feel good. So i talked with her awhile about all her problems that she has been having, and today she is supposed to get her test results back.   I left there and went by Arbys and picked J and i up something to eat, and stopped and filled Sabina up too. Then i came back to the house, ate a sandwich and went for my walk. I did not want to walk, i made the bad mistake of eating before my walk, so my belly was full. Plus it was hot and i was tired and my legs hurt. But i forced myself to go anyways. I got back and watched some tube, and just really became lazy! Watched this really good movie on IFC called "Mouth to Mouth". It was in spanish and was awesome......  Today i was up and ready for work, it was humpday. The day is almost over, and i had some Problems with Conseco Insurance. But i jumped right on top of that and got that taken care of!  Today i plan on walking again, mabye heading up to the gym, not sure. DAMN i need to mail Thomas's cd off already and quit hogging, i have his DVD too! Im such a slacker in that case! Need to Get Sam his new cd as well.  Gotta go, need to burn a cd real quick! Bye  Mika says Ruff Ruff.....and we are off......................~~~~~  Today J went to Mt Nebo and The Harrison TIC, so i have not seen him all day......Stacey, he now knows, and Eric, shame.

      Last night i came home after work and watched some tube for awhile, then got up and worked in Photoshop a tad. I got aggrivated so i gave up on it, way to go eh?! I went for my walk and then as soon as i got back into the front yard i went around and started the mower, and mowed the grass. I went in and watched some more tube, then popped in a movie. I watched American Beauty again. I love that movie and Jason had been wrapped up in his game and i had not seen him for hours now. Mika and me, trying to keep cool and chill out.   Last night Jason finally opened up and i was happy, hit the sack about 1 or so.  Today, this morning, has been the same ole stuff, work work work.  called my sis yesterday, i guess she was working late, didnt get to see her and give her her gift. mabye tonight? ah well...  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Just got off the phone with SIS, she worked late and when she got home she has to take Elizabeth to the emergency Room, she had stuck some toilet paper really far up her nose and couldnt get it out. Poor Sis she works her ass off and still gets no time to her self. I have not been here very long, but from what i have seen of her life, she deserves so much more  than  that. Although she has built a great life for herself, she has a nice house and her BABY, good job. Although her boss is a selfish bitch and gives her way less than she deserves. She puts in so many overtime hours and gets hardly a glance from it. My sis has been having some problems with her health, and it has taken a toll on her as well. I think with all  that she has gone through so far, i am very very proud of her, and still look up to her as the Big Sis. She is still crazy and fun to be around, if she would ever let it lose. I think  that i might give her my Blog address for her to read. Its not much, its my thoughts and my activites, but mabye she would find some enjoyment in it. ha.....Im tricky about who reads what i think, not that i have things to hide, just  the fact that my thoughts are really all i have.

      Holy Crap has it really been this long since i have posted? (spankings lay ahead for shelle)...  Friday Morning i was up at 6:20, and went for my walk. Got back and started to pick up the house then made my way outside to garden and dig alot. After that i figured that since i was hot and sweaty i might as well wash  the car while i was at it. I washed Sabina inside and out and took her to get her vaccumed. She was smiling from ear to ear. Then i went inside and started to get ready for Dans party that night. Eric came over and we hung out for a bit then went ahead to the party. The Party was a blast, it was fun. After the drinking and feeling good, we all started a game of Dominoes. Now that was fun, we were all cussing and telling each other to kiss our ass! I was hoping that Thomas and Jen would have showed up, but they didnt. We all sat out on the back deck and torches and candles gave off sweet light as we listend to the tunes and talked. Some danced.   Saturday Morning i got up late, it was 5 min until my aerobics class started, i jumped up and got dressed, hit the car and headed out. I got there and the lady told me that the lady that teaches the class hurt her back, and there are no more classes!!! I was sad for her, but pissed off. So my tired eyes headed back towards the car, i got back in and took a yittle napie! Got up and started to work around the house again, then hit the road in search of a shirt and to go to the 21/21 salon. I waited for the Salon to open but i got tired of waiting and left. After my other running around i went home, J was up and around and wanted to go out a little. So i hopped back in the car and we headed out. Jason wanted to get our own Dominoes to play at home. You would not even think about how hard it is to find the Plain Black and White ones!!!! We went to...Wal-mart,mardells,the game room, hobby lobby,hobby town USA, ToysRus, and finally found them at Target! They were the off white ones, but that was damn good enough for all the running around the we had done. I didnt want to leave Toys R us, because of all the board games! Risk, chutes and ladders,candyland, connect four, battleship, oh man i wanted them all! Games are very expensive for those that have not checked them out recently. They are like 30 bucks for a board game. No wonder your mom and dad always said "no"! ha..... SO we went back to the house and played around a bit then Eric showed up and We got dressed and went to Becks. It was fun, good food, about break your wallet, but good. I got them on the Touch machines on the bar that was fun! Played the Photo hunt and other games.  Sunday, eh, not a good timeto be a girl if ya know what i mean. So i layed around for a couple of hours in pain! Then i forced myself to get up and around. I am not able to stay laying around for very long, it bothers me to do so. I have to get stuff done. So i got up and Eric came over and jason Eric and I went to Sams and bought some good stuff. Food and bevs. Then we went to Wal-mart to get a Grill. Bought one and headed to the house, eric stayed to put the grill together and Jason and I ran to the store for some buns and hamburger meat! We came back and cooked, ate and it was fun! Then we sat around and talked a bit then he hit the road. J and I came in and watched some TV and played some Dominoes again. Then we went to bed.....snoooooooze  MONDAY MORNING!  Jasons alarm didnt go off, so he rushed into my room and i was woke up by him screaming in pain! He was right next to me on the bed, and Mika was barking at him. I opened my eyes  to see and i was trying to keep mika away from him and he was sleepy and screaming. We were already late and jasons arm came out of socket again. He half ass dressed himself and we went to work. We were 30 min late to work. His arm was still out of socket when he walked into his office. It popped back in about 5 min after that. My vision was so blurry and i was tired. My hair had not been brushed and i had no make-up on. My dress was half ass, and i knew what kind of day was ahead. The office was busy and everyone was running around. There was work piling up on my desk and i was about to pass out! At lunch i went home and put my keys on the entertainment center and they fell and knocked over Mikas dog food all over the floor. Yes this is my day so far........

      Friday ~ Friday  Today for some reason i came to work with my head held high and a huge smile on my face. (ahem, could have something to do with 3 in the morning)! Damn that was awesome. But i was ready for my day. Jason got home about mid-night last night. And once again today he left at 8:14 and i will not see him until about 10 tonight. There was a whole lot of drama in my family yesterday. My brother is sleeping with my other brothers girl, shit like that.  Im glad that i was not apart of that situation. I might go see mom today after work again. I enjoyed spending time with her.  Today i didnt even take Sabina out for lunch, i went with Char to Subway and to the land. Im sure Mika is wondering where i am, and why i have not let her out for lunch. Poor baby girl! Brout Beatrice back a sammich and we our fat and sassy now!  Last night i was sitting at home and i was talking to Thomas. He asked me what was for dinner and i told him that I was going to get some celery and munch on. He told me that i deserved a pizza. I laughed and told him that i couldnt afford one, better yet, did i need one. So i was outside smoking and a pizza man pulls up to the house. I said:" Thomas did you order me a pizza"? he said that he did. I went inside and he told me  to open it, so i did. On the inside there was a note that says:"hope this is better than celery" "chips and dip are 99% fat free"! with a big smiley face. He had the guys up there wright me a note on the inside of the pizza box. I was in shock, that someone would go to such links to do that. That is a quality that is hard to find in people. Someone  that is spontanious and is all about some time and effort! Loved it, he got brownie points with that. Oh yeah, and he got me a 2 liter of coke too! hehehehehe awesome  The day is starting to slow down a tad......Have to get Mika to  the vet! sigh

       urlLink Brainbench - The Measure of Achievement   This is an awesome site that i ran across. It has a whole bunch of free tests that you are able to take. If you pass you can buy a certificate for like 10 bucks. It has lot of options and its totaly worth a look!      Here is a personality test from here, and here are Shelles results :   PART 1: PERSONALITY EVALUATION    Trait         Range         Trait    Introverted               Extraverted      Candid               Considerate      Impulsive               Cautious      Excitable               Relaxed      Practical               Imaginative      Concrete               Abstract              Range              Your Social Boldness: Introverted VS Extraverted  You are moderately introverted. I bet you hear this a lot, "You are so nice." That is because you do not have a brash, bold personality, instead you are warm and friendly and a pleasure to be around. You are not into the wild, crazy nightlife scene. To you a nice social atmosphere tends to be a quieter, more comfortable place where you can spend time with good friends. Your cooperative nature is especially pleasant in a group atmosphere where decisions must be made. You may not always be the person who initiates conversations or talks first in a meeting, but when you have something important to say you are willing to share it. At times you can be shy, but this does not mean that you are being standoffish, just that you are cautious and need time to assess the situation.     Your Agreeableness: Candid VS Considerate  You are moderately considerate. You are an agreeable person. This means that you are well liked and people really enjoy your company. And why wouldn't they? People can sense that you are taking a genuine interest in them and this makes them feel special and as a result, they have high regards for you. With your altruistic personality, you get a lot of practice at making people feel special. In fact, you feel great joy when you help others. Another nice feature you possess is your ability to cooperate. Not everyone can do this, so it is very important in a meeting or social situation to have someone like you present in order to maintain a harmonious situation. This comes from your tendency to want equality and fairness. In dealing with others, you prefer not to manipulate people instead you tend to be open and sincere. This makes you a popular and well-respected individual.     Your Self-Control: Impulsive VS Cautious  You are very impulsive. You are an independent thinker. You do not need a book of rules to tell you how to behave - you know inside what is right and what is wrong and you act accordingly. You are able to live life spontaneously, because you are able to make decisions without endless deliberation. In fact, when you and another person are making a decision, you are able to reach a solution fairly quickly while the other person has to cautiously plan every step. Eventually, they will agree with you, which is frustrating when your first impulse is usually the correct one in the decision-making process. You tend to be a little more casual, and you do not feel out of sorts when your home or office is not perfectly neat. In general, your life is pleasurable - you know how to have fun and will never be accused of being staid or stuffy.     Your Anxiety Level: Excitable VS Relaxed  You are very excitable. You do not like stressful situations. You tend to react emotionally to stress, which can lead to bad moods, or even anxiety, anger, or depression. You like to be treated fairly, and may become upset if you sense that someone is trying to cheat you. You may find urges and cravings irresistible to the point that you are giving into them even if you know you will regret it or feel guilty later. Sometimes you may feel uncomfortable in social situations, even thinking that others are judging you. This self-consciousness may show through as shyness, because you do not want people to think poorly of you. You tend to worry and are apprehensive in unfamiliar circumstances.     Your Openness to Change: Practical VS Imaginative  You are moderately practical. You tend to be more comfortable when your daily activities are familiar and unchanging, rather than constantly in a state of flux. You prefer to deal with facts and not ideas. You prefer to be more practical and pragmatic, but you are able to be creative when the situation calls for it. You prefer the conversation or situation to be more straightforward. Emotionally, you are more conservative and tend not to express your feelings openly. You have a proper demeanor, which summons respect from those around you.     The way you Think/Reason: Concrete VS Abstract  You are very concrete in your thinking. You tend to prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious to the complex, ambiguous, and subtle. You might even regard the arts and sciences with suspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use. You believe that intellect should not be equated with intelligence, as intellect is an intellectual style, not an intellectual ability.

      I am having some kind of break down i think. The last time i started to feel this way i packed up all my stuff and moved to another state. And that scares me because i dont really think that im ready to move. Sometimes i wish that i could just get away, get away from it all. I feel that i am not appreciated at my job, as if i were to not show up no one would miss me, they would only get upset that i have not come in. I feel that everyone wants a chunk of my time, but toes get stepped on when others are not chosen. But at the same time i feel that i dont have enough friends.Im stuck in a constant spinning circle that never seems to want to let me off. I need to get into something that will occupy my time and that i can be good at. I clean the house and mow, garden, read, and bundles of other things. But as soon as they are done i am left looking for something else  to do. I have mowed the yard twice in the last week. I blamed it on the rain that made the grass grow. When i am done doing whatever and letting J have time to hiself, i want to spend time with him. But he seems  that he could care less to do so. Things were diffrent before i moved in, but to really think about it, they were not that diffrent. I am in a state of daze and confusion, without all the good drugs to get me there. I want to go to school or classes, and get  a good job with people that are not like people that i work with now. I need to get a second job, because i make no money to do shit with. I guess im looking for someone to be proud of me, and i have done nothing for anyone to be. I want to be good at stuff that matters.  Jason and i argued last night, well more like i argued with myself. He just does not get stuff that affects me. When i am upset he still does not come out of his room and try to talk to me. He has to know that it does not matter what i am upset about, he has to put forth the effort to figure out whats wrong. Its only a matter of loving someone. I do for him. I know that he is diffrent in that way than I. But he cant just turn me off or go somewhere away from me when i am mad. Things will never get solved and it will only build. I have learned to keep myself busy while he is doing whatever in his room. I have to knock on his door and ask if he wants to come out and smoke with me. Then right after the cigg, hes back in there without a word spoken. mabye i am being too wierd, nah. Last night i was so messed up that i didnt know what to do. I cried, i laughed, i threw things, i moaned, i stared in space. The whole time that i was going through this, not once did he come and figure out what was upsetting me.   Last night i got off work and went to spend some time with Jeremy. We went to Subway and watched about 30 min of a movie then i split to see jason. I had a good time over there with him. He is diffrent when he is alone then here at work. Its funny how those  things are.  I tried to see if thomas was online last night and he was not. I didnt talk to him very much yesterday, it was a funny day.  I wonder what  the hell to do next, i want to drink from the devils cup.    If i were to move, would people miss me. Have i been a passer by in the lifes of few here? Just like a gust of wind i can be gone and no one would care i assure you. I want to be held and talked  too. I want someone to understand me. why is this so hard to find? Mabye because im too hard to figure out. My life is a complete mess right now and i have no where to turn. fuck...~...

      Today started out sunny and now its turned into a cloudy heat wave. Its so humid here, and i hate it when it feels it wants to do so. I still get myself mixed up every now and again when its hot and looks like rain. In texas if it rains, majority of the time its gonna cool off. when it rains here, it just gets worse than it already is. Sigh..  Getting up this morning was not so bad, and it was super cool in the room. I was on time t o work and had no problem at all. Last night Mika was laying by jasons door to his room, thinking  that he was inside. I had the door closed to his room and its usually like  that when he is playing his game. Poor baby girl, she was tricked. Jason called me not to long ago and said that it would be about 9 before he showed up tonight, but he would be showing up.  Last night i talked  to Jeremy on instant messenger and he shared his web-cam with me. So  the whole time that we were talking, i could see him. Given that he is really buff and works out alot, he was korny about it. sitting there talking, he was like "brb". Then he got up and walked away and started to take off his shirt. Im not stupid i know that he wanted me to see, ha. Then he came back and sat down without a shirt on. He sent me a couple of songs that were pretty cool.  I talked to Ken last night too, he misses Mika and would like to see her soon. I was thinking that mabye next week he could have her, although its going to be hard for me to give her up, even if it is for a week. eh.  Jason called last night and we talked for about 5 min, he was busy and ready  to settle in. I watched my Blind Date, and that new show......where the 5 guys are gay and they turn straight guys lives around!! It was an awesome show, and i think that im addicted! damn....  Thomas was a talker yesterday as well, and that was cool. I didnt catch him online last night, he must have been busy painting.  SO here i am wondering what i will do with my night tonight. Although i will admit that it is nice  to lay around and do what you want! ha  Today after i left the house at lunch, there were come carpenter guys that were by the side of  the road working on a house up the street! I drove passed them, there were about 7 of  them. They all stared and smiled, whistled, and such. Then one guy grabs his heart and stumbles out into the road. I smiled so big, it was so sweet and romantic! It was like he had never seen something such as myself! It was not a play face it was a serious face. I waved at him and he waved back. It just made my day for a man to do such a thing. It was very romantic and i loved it!  Here is the front page of the Second Salon. This picture was taken when we were coming back from Iowa, just as the sun was wanting to set!

      Monday was a day that i could have fallen asleep no matter where i was or what time it was. It was a long day and Jason didnt get home till a little after 9. I mowed the yard and had some landscaping ideas that i followed through with. I cleaned up the back porch and rearranged things a bit. I watered all my plants and to my surprise i have elephant ears popping up that i planting 2 weeks ago. Im happy about the way that things have started to come together, although i would love to go and buy some more plants for the yard. But i really cant afford that, and i know that i shouldnt!  Tonight i will be in the house all to myself all night long. Jason will be spending the night up at Devils Den state park because of work. Poor thing, its this time of year that wears him out hard core. I might go over to my moms or see what else i can come up with. I would hate to just sit around and think about being by myself. But mabye i can get some things done, who knows! I wont see much of Jason this week at all come to  think about it. He might be home at night but he will be on location all this week.   Got an E-mail from my dad and Margie yesterday, i was so excited to see them able to get one to me. Margie said that she had even surfed the net a little GOOD GIRL! I was so proud of them for that.  Today i have a dentist appt. at 3:30..yeah, sigh  Gotta run

      Last night was a lazy night to say something at all. I came home and Started to pick things up around  the house. I went to the ATM to get a Check Balance, and then headed off to the doller store! I found so many things at this doller store i was major excited! I had never been to this one and they seemed to have it all! I picked some stuff up including some paper towls, plates and forks for the party. After that i headed back to Subway to get the exact same thing that i had for Dinner the night before. Her so silly! But i had collected 2 whole stamp cards. So the last two dinners have been free for shelle.  I ended up scrubbing the kitchen floors and rearranging a tad. Scrubbed the cabinets and the walls, plus the stove and washer. I swept and vaccumed and made sure that things were starting to come together. Jason stayed at Devils Den last night, so it was Mika and I. Ken called and ended up coming over for about 30 min, i had a check that i needed to give him for half the Phone bill. Then he left and it was Mika and I again! I cleaned up some more and watched some tube. Then i ended up going to bed about 1am.   I had this really weird dream last night:  Jason and i were going to Visit Thomas, and he lived kinda a ways away. We got there and hung out for awhile. Then Jason and i ended up going to bed, well, we slept together in the bed, all night long. Come the morning Jason goes out to the car to get some stuff. Then Thomas comes into the room and says that he can tell that Jason and I slept together. He starts yelling at me and throwing things. He tells me to get the hell out! Then about 15 min after he storms off, his dad walks in the room. His dad hands me like 4 checks, totaling 100.00. He tells me to take this money and never return. He tells me to never contact Thomas again and to stay out of his life.

      OK, i just read Thomas's blog and according to that he does not plan on attending my party. I can understand  the fact that he is broke, but i dont really know what to say. I cant get him out of the house, and it seems that when it comes to partys and me, he has yet to attend. Im not going to worry about it any longer, if he cant come for one reason or another then its a good reason as far as i am concerned. And i shall leave it at that. Things that i would like  thomas to know, but feel that it might hurt his feelings......  1. Your work is awesome, but get the hell out of the house...There is life beyond that. 2. Stop trying to impress everyone, and just be yourself no matter what the cost. 3. If you are broke, say "i cant do that" or just make it up some other time, dont throw yourself in a bind, to make something happen. 4. Take some time out of your life, and get some sleep and do what you want to do! 5. Depression moves in fast, try to think of other things that dont get you down!  Although i am guilty of 1-5, but its good and useful info for Thomas! He needs to expand his daily routine or nothing will happen. This is not because i want him to come to my party, this is because i read and talk to him about his daily life and i feel that he needs this. What he really needs is a vacation, needs to find a buddy and just get the hell away for awhile. Trust me, it can do you wonders....Colorado here I come!  Jason is leaving me once again, I am jealous and beside myself at the same time. I am beside myself for the fact that i kinda seem lost when he is gone. I have always lived with someone and i am having to learn that i am on my own. Even when he is there, he is doing what he wants in his room. I am not used to that and im trying to get comfortable with living this way. I have Mika and she loves to love on shelle. I hope that i can make a little Money this weekend at my garage sale. I dont have much, but i need all that i can get! I hope that it will be a cool day and not so humid. Im excited about the party, even though we may not have many there, that suits me just fine.  I wrote my dad an e mail, and i wait on his response. My mom in Texas will get a phone call from me tonight, and i plan to clean some more tonight! Ken mentioned that he would like to hang out, i have not made my mind up about that either.  Well, i have about 6 hours of work to go...oh yeah!

      Yes, yes, spank away i have not blogged in a few days!  My brother was let off with 1 year prob. and a 500 doller fine. Turns out that his crazy chick was seeing things and he had no gun or anything else! Please hope that i dont see her, shelle be less  than nice. My mom took off to Hardy Arkansas so that when he got out of jail she would not see him. She knows that he would try to come around and she needed a break. Cant say that i blame her much! She will be back in time for my Bar-B-Q.  Speaking of my bar-b-que, i am streching myself to the limit trying to get everything togther and in order for this thing.  I talked to Thomas about it last night when he called, i was saying that i was kinda stressed out about everything that needs to get done. I felt that i did not have enough time to get everything together! And he said " that is a sign of a good host". That made me feel so good, because i really never thought that anyone paid any attention. Its the little things, No one ever just stops and says, wow. eh.... mabye i should stop trying so hard to make everything nice.  Today for lunch i went to Kens house to pick up mikas cage, sarah is getting her puppy today and i am letting her borrow it. I am so excited for her, seeing how her other one died. She can crate train this one, like i did mika!  Vehicle Fleet class today!

      Ok, just got off the phone with my mom and found out that my brother is in Jail.  Last night about 1:45 in the morning Joe got arrested, that stupid slut girlfriend of his leaves my other brother and tries to go back to joe. Well hes has been doped up hard core for like a week solid if not longer. And when she did, he beats the shit out of her. There was talk that he also had a gun and no telling what else. They slapped a 3rd degree assault charge on him and now he is in jail. We also heard that he had a meth lab up in his attic, and we are hoping that the cops didnt catch that. Having a meth lab is 40 years alone. I hate to say it, but im not sure i will be seeing my brother for awhile!   And there is the is latest......

      The sky is cloudy today with sprinkles here and there, and im glad because i am in the mood for rain. This weekend J and i hung out alot and went to diffrent places. I had so much fun, and i am glad that he wanted to do that with me. And it was his idea, so that made it all the better.  We went to see Pirates of the Car. it was a really good movie and i was waiting to see it. I only wish it was made more for adults than kids, But all in all it was a good movie and i am glad that i saw it. We also went and watched "blue car" at the Marketstreet theater. That was a good movie also, it brought up some memories of my childhood. It brought up some memories that i care to forget, but sometimes you need to be reminded that things are better now than they were.  I worked out in the yard last night for awhile, the bugs tore me up but i still insisted that i keep on. Im trying to get the yard looking half way decent. I plan on working in that yard this whole week with what i can. I want to have a pretty yard that i can be proud of!!! Something to show for all my hard work, ha.  I think that i am going to have a garage sale and a bar-b-que this weekend, im going to invite my sister and her baby, some of my buds too. I hope that Thomas will be able to make this one, for he is also invited. I want him to see if mabye he can invite Jen as well. Its not a big blow out, just a sit around and eat and have fun deal. I will get up and have the garage sale early and then start the cooking around 5 or 6. Im going to spray around the house for bugs so we all dont get bit hanging out.  I made some art this weekend, i think it turned out better than i thought. I had no paint or crayons or anything, so i used my make-up. It was really cool, i really had to work with  the colors and figure out how they were going to lay. I have it up on my wall, not a bad way to decorate.  Mika will love the Bar-B-que, she will sit and wait for someone to drop some food for her, as if she is not spoiled enough!  Gotta run....bye

      Today was the first day that i made a post in the new BETA site for RP. Their new site is awesome, and i have encounterd little to no problems with it. I will be improving Seconsalon.net with Jason so i need to get on some PHP pretty fast. Turns out that who RP used for the new site is what i will be using. Everyone in the office is taking off in the same week as i, its weird, like this was national vactaion week or something. So the office will be bare and thats when i like to be here, tisk tisk, imagine  that.  I have talked to Thomas slim this week, i didnt go  to dinner with him on Weds. Ever since then i have barley seen him online and his talking has been few words. We are talking about getting a whole bunch of people together and playing some D + D. That would be supa~cool to watch, people get into that like white on rice. Perhaps i can learn, i have always wanted to.  Mika and her tummy are starting to get a little better. Last night was a movie lazy night, and i think  that tonight might be the same! Yeah Yeah and its Friday and i plan on staying home, sigh. Mabye because im already broke and i know it! Mabye i could play "guess whats in the fridge" tonight.  Jason has been extremly nice the last couple of days, whooo rah  Ken is getting a tad edgy, but will watch Mika while i am in the mountains!  I just need to be loved and touched and , oh my.....

      Hump day has arrived and here i am still arriving.  Today i have found out that i will not get my painting that Thomas has painted for me. The rain has scared him away, and he does not want to risk it. Also i will not be having dinner with him tonight like i had originally planned. I asked if i could bring Jason, along and it was a "private party". I will just not go and Jason and i can go out and eat somewhere. Jason does not deserve to stay at home, he needs me. HEhehehehe  On other subjects, the rain is still here and i love it. Its cooler outside and i love the sound of the rain. Last night was so nice i fell asleep listening to the rain and thunder. The lightning that i was watching drifted away as the eyes closed, and i love to fall asleep like that. I actually had a good time yesterday with Jason, he watched Queer eye for the straight guy. I had fun watching Jason watch the show. I like to spend time with him like that.  Its almost lunch time here so i gotta run!   Back from lunch, oh yummy! Jason and I went to eat at the Macc. Grill and im full of bread and pasta stuff! Now i need a nap, and some love making!

      Things to think about.......  ~While we have the gift of life, it seems to me the only tragedy is  to allow part of us to die- whether it is our spirit, our creativity, or our glorious uniqueness.  ~Dont cry because its over, smile because it happened.  ~Treat your friends like you do your pictures, and hold them in their best light.  Taste the other side of the mind, all of us have some, some just never let it out.

      I just got back from having Sushi with the boys! The guys were awesome and were right up my alley. They were into comic books, loved to talk about music! One of them has read "The Art of Deception" and we had a discussion on that too. Both of them are super smart and very nice. We had sushi, then went to the purple cow for a shake. I watched them draw and we all talked, it was an awesomely good time.  It was good to see Thomas again, he was looking very nice and well. We made jokes and cracked on some things here and there. It was really cool because at the purple cow, thomas played cuda on the jukebox! I love heart and he didnt know that, it was like a "no shit" kinda thing.  I am home now, just walked in and as you may know i am in my room doing my blog. Like a good girl, no spankings! Mika lays outside my door, but i dont want to let her in, its too hot for her. I feel like i want to go back out and hang with them. One of them asked for my e mail address and im glad so we can keep in touch. The one that works for Bedford is moving on the 7th. He is moving to Boston for school, im bummed out about that, but at least i was able to meet him! The other one actually sang "michelle" by the beatles to me! And it was very correct in his accent, it was a nice change of pace......Good Job Thomas!  Congrats on showing me a good time when i needed to be shown one!  Gotta go, i feel like reading or playing with the camera, perhaps shelle take a smoke then play a bit!  See ya!

      Monday.....sweet Monday....when the week starts and you always start late.  I have not blogged this weekend, i was quite busy for all of the little two days we get. Friday we prepared for the party and finished final errands. Saturday we prepared some more and started to cook, i mowed the yard and put all the Tiki Torches out. I did some last min things for the outside and inside. Here are the people that attended... Eric Dan Cylinda Joni Charity Janeane Beatrice Jacob Bessie Charles Bruce Jimmy  Mom Jim and of course Jason Mika and me......  It was alot of fun and i everyone had a good time. Everyone went home about 11 or 12 and Joni, Charity, Janeane, Jason and I went to my moms. My mom had some uncles and aunts of mine over there playing Poker. It was sooooo much fun, we all laughed, drank and lost money! That ended about 3am.  Sunday my mom calls and wakes me up, she says that My sis and her are going to head to the Mall for some shopping. So Jason and i went over  there and got to see my neice. My mom, sis,jason, debbie, brie, my brother, went walking around the mall. It was alot of fun and im glad that i was able to go!  This morning we  go to get in Sabina, and her battery is dead. Jason left the keys in her all night!! So he called Eric and Stacey from work to come and give us a jump. I told him, that if he had told me what was wrong i would have walked across  the street and knocked on someones door to give us a jump. There was no need to call someone from work and have them take 15 min  to get here, when it can be solved in 10 min or less! sigh And he says i dont think sometimes.  So i was late to work and could only take a 30 min lunch so i did not use up any more annual leave time that i can not afford! I cant wait to get the hell outta here and go to colo. Sometimes i  think Jason wants me to move out, but i dont feel much like getting into that.  My teeth are hurting, and im having problems with my dentist. I have AOL problems, and i owe Jason some money. All my shit is starting to pile up on me.      I think that Jason has no compassion sometimes, i had a problem with Mika this weekend. SHe was bleeding all over and i couldnt get it to stop. Somehow or another she had got one of her back nails caught on something and it was ripped out. I was freaking out because she was in pain and i could not stop the bleeding. Jason just continued to cook and never turned around the see if it was ok. And then had the nerve to ask me to move out of the way while i was in the floor with Mika in my hands, trying to get her to stop bleeding. I was a total bitch this weekend......last night jason dropped something on his toe, and screamed and moaned, so i jumped up and ran to him. eh, i snapped at him and i shouldnt have. But he stayed in his pissy mood. He screams like he breaks something every time, and i jump up to help him. Everytime he stubs his toe or whatever he screams like he is crying and i run to  him. I guess im not used to a man acting like that. When i stub my toe i bite my lip and go on. Just diffrent in that area, and i have to understand that.  I have certain feelings about something and if i say something i dont want to sound like a bitch, but if i blog it, its off my mind. I dont know when he gets paid or whatever but..... Thomas said that he could not come to my Bar-b-Q because he could not afford too, but then he wants to take me to eat 2 times this week and they are not fast food places. Plus the fact that all the gas he will use to come here twice this week. I guess i dont understand and i am kind of confused.He can meet people for whatever reasons, but wont come to what i invite him  to. Is there a real reason why he didnt want to come? sigh, im not going to worry about it anymore, its blogged and off my mind. This does not meant that i am mad at him, or that i think diffrent of him, its just a thought.  Work sucks no doubt there, i want to see my mom! Joni and i are going to start cleaning houses for a second job. I  think its like 500 dollars a month extra, but its 6 nights a week. So there goes my time but money will be coming in and that will not be  too bad, i guess.  My afternoon here is going to be so long, i wish i loved my job and time could fly past me................ Sleeping on couch makes shelles neck hurt.  Sweet dreams to the one that needs something sweet.  A sweet change is more like it, fuck.....

I know that i talk alot about Thomas in here, so i figured that i would be nice and post his daily thoughts and movements.....   urlLink drinking milk and drawing people    Last night i watched Two episodes of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. I watched them right before i went to bed, and wouldnt you know it i had a dream about them. I drempt that they came over to help me pack for my trip, is that crazy or what?!

      Tuesday Moody Blues.....  Tonight i will have to pack and get ready for my trip to Colorado, im very excited about going! Jason and i will take off about 3:30 to catch the plane. Our plane leaves at 5:30, so we should arrive about 10:30. We have a two hour lay over in Dallas on the way there, and on the way back we have a layover in St. Louis. My Camera is packed already but my clothes are not, hummm. Mika is already at her baby- sitters and i have someone taking care of my fish and watering my plants. Work is so rough when you are excited about something that seems to take forever to arrive.  Thomas has his buddy here from Holland, and hopefully i can get the chance to see him. Josh is moving this Friday to Boston, and i am bummed. I doubt that i will be able to see him before he goes, i will be in colorado. He is a supa-sweet guy and i hate that he will no longer be close. I need to call him and see if i cant get a hold of him. Bob has kept in contact through e mail and he rocks! Im glad that i have another Geek bud. I wish thomas was able to come down more often and see shelle and Mika.  Joni and Charity will be leaving me and heading out towards Palm Beach at the end of the summer, and those are my party gurls. No one to get drunk with! Ken is watching Mika for about 7 days, and i am thankful for his niceness.  Planning on getting my hair done when the money is right, well i plan on doing alot of things when the money is right and no longer tight!  Today is Jeremys B-day and he wants me to hang with him tonight, im afraid that i cant, i have too much packing to do, eh. I will make it up to him when i get back.  Some awesome places were shared with me for when i go to colorado, all thanks to my RP buds!  SunyBuny Railbird The_jake  Thanks guys!  Hopefully i will blog from Colorado on the laptop! Stay Tuned.....

      Sunday night/Monday morning, what have you?  I am here tuning in to some RP, and digging some Bob Marley. Today was busy from the start to finish, and as you can see im not totally done, eh.  Today i got up and went to my step-sisters Birthday party at my moms, she has turned 26 today.  The house was full of screaming kids and people that think they know it all. I dragged Jason along just for kicks, poor guy! My mom, Jason and I would sneak outside with others not knowing and take Cigg breaks.  After we had way to much, Jason and I left to go shopping for some new luggage. He has had the same luggage for years and it was already passed down. Not that i dont like passed down stuff, im the queen of that. Garage Sale you say? Im so there! We ended up finding some and they want  your paycheck from last week and the week before, but he got it anyway.  After that we grabbed some grub and wentback to the house, watched two episodes of "Queer eye for the Straight Guy" and now im here. Oh yeah, we also hit up Barnes and Nobles! We decided since the plane trip might be long coming and going starting this Weds, we might want something more to read. This Weds im off to Colorado and not coming back till Monday! Siked, but the 2 hour lay over in Dallas on the way there, and ST. Louis on the way back im not supa happy about. Im from Dallas so, im sure it wont be that bad.....   RP is messing up on me, so i guess thats a sign for "good night".......Bye guys  *kiss Kiss*

      Last night was really awesome and i had a blast. The movie was good and left all of us with the same look. The kind of look that people are spaced out and quiet. It was not quite what i thought it was going to be, it was better.   The Crew:  Thomas  Jason Jen Matt 2 other people that i just met last night and feel bad that i dont remember their names. and me  Matt turned out to be a computer geek like us and is also into Photography! 5 of us are totally into films and Photography. So when we get together it turns out to be a pretty cool time. My tooth started to hurt in the movie, but i tried to just control it. I didnt want to ruin anyone elses time. The producers and the Director were there and as cool as we hoped. They talked to us a little before the movie and answered our questions after.  After that was over we all headed over to the Purple Cow to grab some din din. Thomas wanted a shake, and Jen and Matt split an "adult shake".  All in All it was awesome good time....  Last night when we came home i noticed that Mika was still acting wierd. She had been acting wierd for the last couple of days. She was eating and drinking but she would act skittish and run and hide under things. She would not come out when she was called and thats not like her. She loves to be around people. She would look around all the time kinda like she saw a ghost and then she would run away.   This morning i got up about 7:30 and took her to the Vet. She got her last shot and i put her on some heartworm medicine. She was negative for heartworms and physically she was awesome. But you can never be too sure! Turns out that she had a slight ear infection and a sore throat. So we got her some medicine and she is all set to go. The vet was concerned that when i went to Colorado, that mabye something tramatic happened while i was gone.  Tonight Jason and I have been invited to hang out with Joni and Chairty or go to Hot Springs with Jen and matt. Humm, gotta decide. Joni and Charity invited us first. Mabye i could tie the two together.    later.....Shelle

      Last night i was posted up alone, Jason was off working at one of our parks. Mika and I enjoyed the alone time tho', and i was calm about not hanging the pictures.  I watched a good movie that i caught about 15 min into it. The movie's title was called "Cube".    urlLink All Movie Guide: Cube   It was the first time in a long time that i have caught a movie on the sofa and been so into it, that when it was over i sat  there and didnt move for about 10 min. After that was over i flipped and flipped and nothing seemed to tickle my fancy except the commercial for "pretty women" that is coming on tonight. That is like my all time fav. movie. I think it has something to do with the whole fairy tale, ill show you type of thing. And of course i guess it helps that Julia is my fav. actress. Richard Gere is a hottie, i never believed the whole gerbil thing. Sean Connery can do it for me too, its the accent and his looks are not shabby either. SO what did i end up watching.....Grease. That John Travolta and his sexy hips. I love to watch Olivia Newton John as well. I remember when i was a kid i would watch those movies and pretend that i was Olivia and sing all the time. Of course thinking that i might get John Travolta didnt help either.  Jason and i purchased some badass pictures while we were in Colorado and had them mailed to us. We went and picked out the frames for all, and i have been very excited to see them on  the wall. Well The wall that i would like them on is kinda a thin wall. So before i started hammering i looked at the clock and it was like 9:30. Not very late i thought to myself, but being the person that i am i will go next door and make sure that its alright. I grabbed Mika and we headed next door. I was kinda hesitant about doing so, the guy is like 18 or 19 years old. He shows complete intrest in me, and (ahem) im not intrested. So he kinda always wants to talk to me at the wrong times type thing. The kind of person you duck from when coming in and out of your house. Kinda reminds me of "Ghost Busters". When she is always going to her apt. and trying to sneak by and there is that nerdy guy that likes her alot. Well, hes not nerdy, just too young, and well im not intrested. Anyways i walk outside and start over to his pad, and i see  that all the lights are off and there is no glow from the TV. So i play nice person and dont hang any of the pictures. I figured that i can just wait till  the light of the next day.   I turned out some of the lights and let the already burning candle give off nice light. I flipped through the channels some more and found Sixteen Candles. This is an awesome movie that i have not seen in some while and was happy bout it. During the commercials for the movie, i wrote 2 letters. One letter goes to Jasons dad and the other letter goes to his mom. They are Thank you letters for the experience that they included me in. Colorado, i will never forget.....  Caught up on some of my E-mails, Robert and i E-mailed back and fourth and i wrote an e mail to daddy. Robert informed me that he will not be able to make it to tonights movie. I could kick his ass, but in a nice way. Im glad  that Thomas is still coming and i think that Jason will also be apart of this as well. Mika cant go, so i will leave her a treat when i leave  the house.   My teeth are still giving me problems, except its not the same one, now its on the other side of my mouth. Pure pain for the past 18 hours, eh. Now the pain has spread into a headache as well. I feel like i want to drug myself up and hit the bed for a nappy nap.  Movie tonight..... Northfork, and the twin polish producers will be there tonight before the showing. Im excited about that, Thomas will be there!  Im out...bye

      The first day back was not as bad as it could have been, i had alot of work so the day went by kinda fast. I got off work and went to pick Mika up. She was so happy to see her mom, as i was very happy to see my baby. Brought her home, her little ears flapping in the wind. I got home and Thomas called to talk, we talked for a little bit, then some buds pulled up. I dont like to talk on the phone when people show up at my house. I think its rude. SO i hung up the phone with Thomas and told him that i would call back. I spent about 15 min talking to Jason and then Thomas's pizza showed up! yes yes, he ordered me another one, very sweet. I ate some pizza, then my tooth started to hurt. Didnt feel like talking on the phone with my tooth like it was, so i didnt call him back. I went to bed early, and felt bad about it.

      Today is my first day back to work since my trip and a big SIGH for that! I will start you from the start......and here we go!  WEDS~ To the plane we went and arrived in Dallas for our two hour layover there. Dallas is so huge, but i still consider it every bit of home. We ran across the airport and got on the tram for the rest of the way. Finally reached our boarding place and we grabbed something to eat! BTW- starbucks is not hard to find in that airport and thats how it should be.....Drive  through please.  We hopped on the plane that will take us the rest of the way to our final destination (Colorado Springs, Colorado). We arrived there at night time and it was dark so the mountains were not seen. Jasons family picks us up and show us our rental car and take us to our rooms. We go to sleep, for tomorrow is the true start of heaven.  THURSDAY~ I set the alarm for 7am, i dare not miss a second of this trip. *buzzzzz buzzzz* I swing my hand over and find the off button. I open my eyes and throw the covers off. I felt like it was christmas or something. No makeup and straight Jam jams on i head for the door. I unlock the 2 bolt locks that are normal for a hotel room and open the door. OMG, i almost fell back against the wall, the view was like no other. The sun was starting to come up and the Moutains were dead ahead. They already had a orange, red and yellow glow. With a purple and blue background. The wind was gentle and cool, and (ahem) no humidity!  I took a couple of steps to the railing and just stared in awww. I ran inside to grab the camera and that was the start of the picture taking!  Royce(Jasons dad), Jason and I went to the store to grab some grub for the week. There just so happened to be a Starbucks in the store, so it was a nice pick me up. Groc. were bought and coffee was in hand. We headed back to the room to unload and Jason happend to sit his double shot expresso on the side of the car in the trunk crease. I took the last of the groc. out and closed the trunk. SPLASH, went the yummy drink that jason had only two sipps out of. oops says shelle and she lowers her head. Her says sorry and he forgives her.  After that we all load up and head out to The Garden of the Gods. urlLink Garden of the Gods History  We walked around on the trails and watched the Rock climbers. We took pictures and it was a wonderful first visit. The rocks were cold when you would touch them, it was strange but very awesome.   After Garden of the Gods we headed to Pikes Peak. There is a train that will take you there. urlLink Pikes Peak Cog Railway Home Page  It was a very tight and small train, but bearable. The train ride seemed to take forever to reach the top, i guess mabye i was excited. I let Jason have the window seat because im a nice person. ha. Once we reached the top it was a temp. drop and everyone pulled out the sweatshirts and jackets! It freezes there every night and its so high up that trees do not grow there. The elevation is extreamly high and alot of people cant take it. Earlier that day the conductor said this kid hopped off and took off running and passed right out. Our bodies are just not used to that! I had no trouble, but Jason was sick for a couple of hours, and he was feeling all better once we came back down.  After that we all headed over to Fargos pizza place. This is a huge Pizza place mainly for kids. It has a huge arcade and desserts for your fancy. Instead of them calling your order number out it show up in a mirror that is hung on the wall. Kinda Snazzy.... The kids loved it and thats the good thing.  We ended up hanging out and playing for the rest of the night.  FRIDAY~ We all headed out to the Royal Gorge.  urlLink Royal Gorge Bridge and Park in the Canon City, Pikes Peak Colorado area   There is also a way to ride a train through the bottom of the Gorge itself!  urlLink Royal Gorge Route Railroad, Train ride through the spectacular Royal Gorge of Colorado. Daily departures year round. Located in Canon City, Colorado.  We did the Arial Tram and all!  IT was so awesome to stand on the bridge and look down, it would most def. give you the heebie Geebies! You could see the train down below and the White Water Rafters! What a site it was, i recommend this trip! Also while we were there i took a Helicopter ride through the Gorge. It was 65 bucks and i was tempted not to do it. It was tricks and a fly through the gorge. The trip was awesome, and def. not for the soft person. I got to wear the little headphones and pressed a button to talk. Of course i requested for a fly by! Im sure the pilot thought that was original! I was yelling and had a huge smile telling the guy to punch it! And Jasons sister looked like she was going to hurl the whole time! Talk about an awesome ride that i hope i never forget.  After that we took the Scenic highway back to town ........  SATURDAY~ We got up and headed towards the wonderful 7 FALLS.  urlLink Seven Falls the grandest mile of scenery in Colorado  We hiked and some rode the elevator down and up. The waterfalls were wonderful, and can you imagine....its privatly owned!... We then went to old Colorado city and went shopping....here is the store that i fell in love with there!  urlLink Barracuda Bazaar  I had a blast walking around with Jason and going into all the shops! After the 7 Falls we headed out towards the mall. Then Kay, Jason and I headed out towards the bar! We played Pool, darts and had a good time!  SUNDAY~ Everyone was up early and headed out to the church. Jasons dad is a preacher and we were going to watch him preach! The service was good and i was impressed. Afterwards we headed out to a amusment park for the kids and (ahem) the big kids. Stayed there awhile and headed back to the mall!   MONDAY~ The rest of the family was off to the planes at 8, so we were up to say good-bye! Jason and I didnt have to go to the plane till 2, so we shopped around a little, headed back to the rental place to return the car! I almost cried at the Colorado air port i didnt want to leave!  another lay over in St. Louis and we were home at 11:00 last night. And a working day today....  So there is the low-down and im sure t hat i forgot some stuff, so stay tuned!

      Today is most def. a better day here at work, whew! It is going by really slow, but other than that, total groove here at the Tourist Hut. Today i had lunch with Stacey and Eric. Those guys are so crazy, we were a hootin and a Hollerin at lunch.   After i watched Jason leave this morning to go out to one of our parks, i was walking back into work and i couldnt help myself but stop and give it to the guard. It went a little somethind like this:  Me-Why were you laughing at me yesterday?  Him- (stutter) I was not laughing at you, I was laughing at something that was going on in here.  Me-Well, I saw you nod at me, when she asked you what you were laughing at.  Him- I was not laughing at you I promise, I promise I was not.  Me-ok (walks away)  Pigs will not Prosper!  Great Weather for Snuggling and im all alone! Sigh

      The people that i work with are crawling up my spine and im trying to shake them. I deal with them every day and you would think that i would be used to them with me being here over three years and all. They work very close to me, there are two of them. They are the kind of people that will act like your friend then turn right around and talk about you. Its the same ole thing no matter where you go, but they seem to have a A+ in the art of talking complete shit. And to add more, they always talk about each other as well, so who really wins in this battle?  Anyways the one that sits right in front of me got busted today, and one of my buds overheard her talking about me. Of course he told me and i asked if it would be alright to confront her,he said yes, so i did. She was shocked and couldnt say much, when she replied her head was down the whole time. Thats suits me just fine, it does not bother me that she talks about me, because im not the first one and i wont be the last. But i felt that she needed to know that she was caught and that i knew. And that gave me a release for now.  My other problem today is one of the Security Officers here,he needs a foot in his ass, and im just the one to give it to him. Hes a jerk and an asshole, and i have had enough. So that is also on my calender. The Security Officer that sleeps and reads books while peoples radios get stolen out of the parking lot he is supposed to protect, go figure. Fucker.....   The vengence of Shelle, round one.

      Last night was a time and a half, and it was worth going for.  We all started to show up at the Steak House and turned out that there was about 20 of us. We hit the bar up then went to our tables to eat. Everyone laughed and passed out presents. I had the Beef Tips with onions and peppers, oh yeah, its as good as it sounds! I went out to the car to get moms present and then i brought it inside. I was kinda wierd about giving it to her in front of all those people, i didnt wanto them to think "shes giving pictures of herself to her mom". But my mom always says that she has no pictures of me, and thats what i fell back on. SO she opened it up and she was so happy, she hugged me twice and everyone wanted to pass it around the huge table. Lets just say that Shelle got a little red in the face at that moment. Everyone was saying what a nice gift it was, and how i was moms pride and joy.  After  that we headed off to Baseline Lounge, the local bar that my moms been going to for years. So i walk in there and go figure, they were having Bush League. The pool league that i actually went to Vegas with for the National Pool Players association. I havent played pool like i used to in about 6 months or more. I just kinda gave it up and started in other things. When they saw me everyone gave me a lashing about why i no longer play and they wanted me on their teams again. I miss playing, i really do. But i have so many other things going on at the same time, that im not sure i can get back into it hardcore like i used to. I used to play 7 days a week, 2 leagues and tournaments on the days that im not playing in a league.  So i played a couple of games for ole times sake, and tossed back some coke with cherries.  I semi-wrote Robert back a quick e mail, so now that is done! Thanks Railbird for your E mail, you rock! Kisses to you.......  Thomas, where have you been today?  Mika was in a playful mood at lunch, i watched a re-run of the West Wing, and headed back to work. and here i am....

      I might have mentioned this site before, but its a good one. I think that Thomas and Robert will get a kick out of it.   urlLink Arts & Letters Daily - ideas, criticism, debate   Today is my MOMS BIRTHDAY!  Dont ask how old she is because she lies to me about it all the time. The last time i asked her and she said that she was 35 going on 34. And i can fully understand the count back method. If it were the case with me, i am 23 going on 22 with a smile. For her gift i ended up getting a really nice frame and putting some pictures of me in there. She has no pictures of me and tells me that she needs some all the time. I dont think that i take good pictures, so pictures of me are few and far between. Jason and i went looking for her a gift last night, and at one point i even had a plain ole gift card in my hand. I just didnt want to give her a gift card. What i really wanted to do was give her a day at the spa, but i cant afford that. Not only can i not afford it, i have never set foot in a spa, i would be down right jealous! ha.  Tonight we are going out to eat and then to the local bar to have some drinks, play shuffle board, and pool. Jason is out of town tonight, so i will be doing this alone. Although it would have been nice to kick his ass in pool! We will meet at Coltons at 7, and i guess be at the bar about 9-9:30. Happy days are here again when you are tossing back whisky and Gin.  In other news, Mika is as fine as wine in Spring time, and is doing alot better than on Friday night. Her loves me in case everyone has forgotten.  My brother seems to be doing better and off the shit for now. There is no time limit on how long he can live without it, so we shall see. Him and his girlfriend, eh, are living out of a hotel seeing how his landlord told him that he had a week to get out of his old place. I really cant see how they didnt tell him to get out before now! oh yeah, they have a cute blond ferret. Its a stinker, and loves to play hide and seek.   Shame on me for real, because i have not written Robert an e mail back yet. As many times as i have reminded myself i could have taken the time to write him back. Its not that i dont feel like writing him, or the subject of the matter bothers me, its just that i get busy and forget. *Shelle pulls out Sabor and taunts herself with a lashing if she does not get in gear*  Thomas has been doing good with keeping up with his blog and im proud of him. Slacking can become very sport in the art of blogging, but you tend to lose out on so much. Keep up the good work Thomas! Oh yeah, Robert, ever thought about starting up your own blog for the circle of readers to enjoy? When are we going to play Some heavy duty D&D???  Talked to my mom (texas) last night and she is still in Colorado until next week. I told her that i was so jealous, that we only went for a week and she has been there for about 3 weeks and coming back in Sept! Talk about some off time, but she is retired now and she deserves every bit of it!   Still need to call pops!   Star- yesterday, pills down the throat.

      The clouds have grown thicker and the sun has ceased to shine, on this Monday, Monday of mine. The day has gone by fast and for that i am thankful. I have been installing alot of patches for the new "worm" virus today on stupid peoples computers. ANd as you know, stupid people tend to take up alot of time, eh. I didnt eat lunch and now im starving. For lunch i went home and gave Mika her medicine, i tricked her and hid it in a hot dog. She never knew what hit her! I also put her ear medicine in her ears. I need to make sure that im getting it in there and her hair is not blocking the goodness. Then i came back to work for another busy rest of the day.  Tonight i need to go buy a gift for my mom, tomorrow is her birthday . I have no idea what to get her and i wont when i go to look. Im broke and thats nothing new, but i cant pass a gift up. Jason will not be able to attend the party  tomorrow, he will once again be off working and i will not be able to see him. Poor thing, he needs a break.  I wonder if his parents have their letters and cards yet?  Will it rain this weekend?  I need to E-mail Robert  I need to call my dad  I need to get some rest!  waiting on 5 and wishing for darkness.

      Here i am once again, a long night that i cant seem to fall asleep. Its 2:35 am, and im watching a good movie called "The Evening Star". Its a really sad but true movie that reminds me kinda of my mom. During the commercial breaks i continue to read "Pattern Recognition" by William Gibson. Stuck in two time warps when i need to be in asleep mode. 7 comes early and the 5 o clock till time to go seems to take forever.  I also caught a good movie earlier than this one that was very awesome. I had been wanted to catch this movie for awhile now and i finally have. "Pay it forward", is very nice, sad, and very well put together. Kevin Spacey was my draw to it i will admit. I have never seen anyone show such emotion and do it with such power that is real. I actually teared up at the end of this one.   Note: The later it gets the more stupid the Info commercials get!  Getting a second job is still very much in my future and i hope that others dont think i have tried to forget about it.  Jason has been asleep for about 3 hours now and i have gone and checked on him 3 times. I love to watch poeple sleep, they are absolute angles. It was hot in his room so i put a wet washcloth on his forehead to cool him off a bit. Then i actually caught myself sitting there and watching him. Watching his eyelids flicker as if he was dreaming something so wonderful he wanted to open then and make sure it was not a dream. The slight flickers in the tips of his hands and the grumpy look he can get from being in pain.  It really is the quiet moments like that when you start to really think about what is importent in life. I often wonder if people think and go thru the little things that i do. I guess i will never know since people read, but never any response.  I can never seem to get off my ass and get accomplishments done. I am truly letting my life pass before my eyes, or am I? Is working your ass off to get a good education to get a good job worth as much time as it takes? Is it a waste of time? I feel like i have to get in school and make something of myself soon, as i am getting older quick. Because what i want is a good paying job that will secure me for life. But i blame having no cash now, keeping me from jumping in the school pool. If i went to school at night, there would go my second job. And just because you go to school, does not insure a badass job. So should you waste the time to do so? Sigh  I wonder what others are doing now...oh yeah, sleeping! Even my dog went to bed an hour and a half ago. ok, im gonna try to hit the sack........Its 3:15 or so now.  Good Night People Of The Laughter....

      Last night Jason and I ended up heading out to Hot Springs to meet up with some friends. I really had a good time, but wished Thomas could have been there. It was totally awesome to see his work hanging up in the hallway. It was so intresting and wonderful. Something that alot of people wish they could only be givin the chance for that.  We had some dinner and then smoked some Arabian Tabacco and chatted. Jen, Jason and i walked down the street to go to the nearest "Hot Spring". We came home around 3am.  Today my mom called me and wanted Jason and i to have dinner with her and some of my family. So we went and it was nice, then afterwards we ended up going over to their house for awhile. Petted the horses out back and soon after hit the road.  Jason has shingles and he is in alot of pain. I feel sorry for him, and there is nothing that i can do for him. He will be gone alot this week on the job. So once again, its just Mika and I.   i need to call my dad..........I need to Email Robert back.

      Work sucks arse today and so does my old ass co-worker with nothing nice to say! Grumpy for no reason, i think she forgot her pills..... I would love to sit her down in a room (like in a cop show) and let her have it!  In other news today, i went to the dentist! Good news and bad news! Here is the lowdown  I have been going to this other dentist for about 5-6 times. She insisted that i needed a deep gum cleaning. I told her that i could not afford it and she howned me until i was able to get the money together. Telling me that my teeth were going to rot out, blah blah. So i had it done, it hurt like hell, they have to go under the gums and clean! Then she tells me that i need like 4 Root Canals! I was thinking, why would i need root canals and i have no cavities? So i took myself to another dentist that was highly recomended. He said that i do not need any root canals and my teeth were fine. I do however need to get my wisdom teeth out, they are putting pressure on my teeth. That will be hurtful, seeing how they are full grown and i have to have bone cut to get them out. I will survive im sure, just pain to look forward to!  I wrote Robert a quick e mail.....  Fell asleep reading my book last night, then woke up at 4am, having  the damdest time going back to sleep.....  Jason leaves me more every day.....  Ken and that AOL problem....  Guys up at work wanting to kiss me....  My body is still ugly and i am not nice to look at! What will i do?

      Whoa, has it really been this long since i have updated? A "im sorry" goes out to the fans that are Loyal....  FRIDAY~ I did away with plans with Eric on Friday, Jason sent me an E mail saying that he was tired. SO i went ahead and thought that rest would be best for him. We hung out and rented movies. Ended up seeing Dan and Cylinda at the movie store. I got a french movie and Jason got one of his picks.  Mine-  urlLink Sur mes lvres (2001)   His-  urlLink All Movie Guide: 25th Hour   They were both good movies, and im glad that it was a relaxing night. He really wasnt into my movie, so i turned it off and popped his in. I am sincere like that i guess. I ended up watching mine a day later, no biggie.  SATURDAY~We got up early and met Eric at the Corvette Show. Erics vette was there, but was not in the show since he is in the club. So others were judged and awarded. I took some pics, and i will share sometime. It was an awesome show. They also had Bikes there, and some of those Biker guys were hot as hell. Old enough to be my dad, but i didnt seem to mind all that much. (Teach me Daddy) I got  to see a really nice V-ROD. Took pictures of that too, whew. If i only had money......  After that we left and went to my Aunt Judys. That was a site to see and im not going to get into that, for offense of some readers. Jason and I ended up sitting on the porch and laughing and making fun of some people. My mom and everyone else that was getting drunk as hell, and swimming, were having a blast. Its good to see my mom have fun,and its all good. I really wanted to Pimp out Jason, but 300 dollers was not enough for some double Ds. So i refrained and sat back in my seat.   After that we went to the movies and watched S.W.A.T. The movie was good, but the plot really sucked ass. It was  the kind of movie that they gave you no details on what happened before or after in the peoples lives. Seemed like it was a R rated movie, but made some cuts to make it PG-13 or something like that. Gave no details on the bad guy and what he was after. I dunno, just a real half-ass movie.  Went home and hit the sack......  SUNDAY~ got up on sunday and hung around the house. I had some chores laid out and got threw with about 3or4 of them. I ended up reading my new book for hours and letting the other, do what he wanted. My new book, if i have not introuduced it is:    urlLink Barnes & Noble.com - Full Frontal Fiction: The Best of Nerve.Com   Found out that the book is messed up in the middle and non of the pages go togther. Goes like, 84,95,87,67, that type of shit. I was pissed because i was hard core into this book and its all messed up. I had to like go 5 pages ahead, then 7 pages back. eh....   MONDAY~ worked, worked worked....  After work i had Thomas and Robert call, they were in town and wanted to hang out. I was excited and wanted to go for some food and fun. We ended up eating at the Olive Garden, so yummy..... We were laughing and joking and Robert drew me. That is the first time that i have ever been drawn in my life, it was cool. Robert had the idea of saying that it was Thomas's birthday and having all  the crew come over and sing to him. I  thought it was a really cool idea, and im up for funny stuff. So i excused myself and went to the bathroom, i told the lady that it was his birthday and had the deal set. They came over and looked at Thomas and said Happy Birthday. Thomas said "its not my birthday" with such a face, it was sooo funny. Robert and I said "YES, it is Thomas"! So they sang to him, and when they left, Robert and I got it! ha..... I t hink that Jason had a good time, and i think that its a good idea, the four of us.  After  that we all headed off to barnes and noble. I ended up telling  the people there about my book and everyone split to look at things. It was funny, like we were having some sort of book worm war, as we drug each other around in shock, that they have not read "this guys book" or "this guys book". Was starting to get a little scary... Jason bought us all drinks and i was happy  that he did that. It was a very nice gesture. I ended up getting another book at barnes, jason picked it out for me.   urlLink Barnes & Noble.com - The Devil Wears Prada  This is my new book!  After that we all went back to our house and hung out for awhile. Watched some of Howerd Stern (Jenna Jameson), when The West Wing was not on. That pretty much sums up the night, it was fun and we had a good time. I want to make Robert a CD, and i want Thomas to make me another Groove CD.  I want to much.....   In other news, i am so depressed about my  inner and outer self! Sigh, wishing i was attractive and that people can get aroused by looking at me. Thinking that mabye i scare some people.   Outta here

      Today has not been that bad, but would have been better if by chance it was a friday. Today we had Media in our offices about the new Clinton Presidential Library. I wondered why they were here about that, but i guess it will be a tourist attraction of some sort. So we had to make sure our desks were clean and us also, ha.  I had lunch with Eric today and Stacey popped in for a mere 5 min. I felt sick when Shannon caught us outside and wanted to talk to us, that boy needs help! Then he wants to stop at my desk later in the day as well. sigh, just , um, no.  Jason is off working at some of our parks today, and MIS is a Ghost town, or so they want it to seem that way.   Joni and Charity want to hang out with us this weekend, i gave my nodd and its on. Tomorrow night at 7!  Eric will be going to Tunica tomorrow, but he will be back on Saturday. Eric want start hanging out with us more often, so i shall do so.  I need to go to Barnes and get (4 Blonds), its a book that i have found and i think that it will be good. It kinda ties into what i was reading before "the devil wears Prada".  I plan on getting this book as soon as i get paid! I need something to read!  A water maine busted here at work, so now we have no working water, damn, no bathrooms, or anything!

      I come out of my room into the darkness of the house. I squint my eyes to try and see making sure i dont trip on a little black animal as i make my way to the front door. I open  the door and hear the sound of much needed oil, and wonder if it made the same noise when this house was built. I step onto the old need to be painted porch, and thank myself that there is old paint on it, for im sure that splinters would then be involved. I lean my head to the left because of the hanging plants, that i thought was a good idea months ago. I make my way to the chair in the corner. I sit and look around, i notice the dead silence. I look up thru the tree limbs to the moon on the other side. The moon was very bright tonight, and i guess that made the cickets want to come out and throw prewinter party. The only light that was on was the orange light that got brighter when it was attached to my lips. I sat there, in silence and wonderd where everyone was. I could hear few cars in the distance and the wind made no presentation tonight.   Tonight is just another unwelcome night of being nothing.

Time goes by faster, the older that you get, this i know is true. I did nothing as i had said before and i have done nothing since then.  Tonight Eric will be coming over to watch the final episode of Boy Meets Boy with me. Also they are showing a new Queer Eye for the Straight Guy tonight that i dont want to miss. He will be here about 6:30. He is even ordering the Pizza for tonight and i am happy about that. So we will have a rocking good slum of a time!

      Friday morning about 4am i was woke up by a nasty nasty feeling, so i headed off to the bathroom and ralphed for a solid hour. Jason told me that i should call into work, and that surprised me because he normally dosent say things like that. I knew that i couldnt because i had to much to do and what would it look like (me calling in the day before our 3 day weekend). sigh.. So i dragged myself into work and worked and got my work done in a few hours. After that i headed off to my moms and she took care of me the rest of the day. Jason had to go to the parks for the day to work. If he hadnt had to work on Friday, we would have headed off to Iowa for the weekend. Mika would have gone too.  Saturday i layed around the house, and then went to see "dirty pretty things"! It was a good movie just becuase Audrey Tatou was in it!   urlLink Dirty Pretty Things (2002)   We went to see the early one, and after that we came back and i read my book for the next 4 hours before heading off to bed. Didnt feel good enough to go much of anywhere and felt that a rest was needed. Jason didnt feel like going anywhere, and i cant say much seeing how its not my car.  Sunday i spent ALL day reading and slumming around the house. I never got out of the house till about 6 or so to go rent a movie. I rented "The Sweetest Thing". IT WAS SO FUNNY! It is just how i act when i let it all hang loose with my buds! Its a great movie and i was so afraid that it would be a stupid chic flick. I took a risk and was surprised!   urlLink Sweetest Thing, The (2002)   I would have to say that its a great movie!!!!! Everyone has to take the time to see it!  Today i have once again layed around the house....cleaning and getting back to reality by checking my email. I FINISHED MY BOOK!   # THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA# Its an awesome ass book and i cant wait to find another just like it!  Today i think that im going to go see "Swimming Pool" with jason. And THEN>>>>>>TCU plays at 7, so im set!   urlLink Market Street Cinema: Little Rock, Arkansas    urlLink Texas Christian University Horned Frogs - Official Athletic Site    I need another book!  Its raining and its awesome snuggle weather, Mika and i need to cuddle...

      (Wearing orange in a state of red)  The rain came in last night and I loved it. I had the front door open with the windows open as well. I watched a foot ball game and did nothing but lounge around. Jason cooked me dinner and desert that was a nice surprise!  Today I come into work and there is some HOG stuff taped to my computer. I of course wore my orange and was ready for whatever!  At lunch Eric and I went and Picked up Jason and headed to the mall for some quick food. Arbys played a factor, and we also saw some guys from DIS, Jeremy and Sam.  Its Friday, and as far as I am concerned, whoooo rahhhh  The Arkansas vs Texas game is tomorrow and the kick off is at 11:05. Hook em Horns!

      Last night was not a nice night to say the least. I had the cops called on me......  Here is the low-down  Yesterday at lunch Jason Eric and I went to drop off the movies at lunch. YOU HAVE TO understand, we are very careful with our movies that we rent. So we dropped them off and headed back to work. Well last night about 9 or after, the phone rings and it is some women from the Movie Gallery. She pops off attitude to me from the start to the finish of the conversation. I still remained calm, and we went up there. Jason was pissed because anyone who knows jason knows that he is like the most honest guy. Jason went in there telling the lady that he gives his word that he returned the movie and that he knows it was in there. The lady popped off attitude at him and told him pretty much to hell with his word, its the empty box she is looking at. She never even tried to talk about working something out. She was rude to Jason and was already rude to me on the phone, but NO ONE speaks to jason like that in front of me. We went out and looked in the car, drove all the way back home and looked in the house again. NO CD!  We drove back, i told Jason to wait in the car and i was going in. I was going to come at it from another approch and be totally nice. I told her that we have been renting from there for more than 2 years and we have never had a problem. That we know the cd was in their when we brought it back. It took her damn near no time to start yelling at me.   I asked for her boss's number, and she faked looked around and told me that she could not find it, but she could assure me that he would call me back! (YEAH RIGHT) Then i was not goint to make a comment on her calling me with attitude, but i did, i told her that she should not be calling peoples houses so late and giving them attitude!  Me-so when did you become manager? her-yesterday Me- oh, haha, figures her- dont you try that with me Me-The other manager would not have done us this way her-well hes not here, i am, and this is how it is her- im going to call the cops and have you thrown in jail! Me- you cant get me thrown in jail her-im pressing charges and you will be thrown in jail   Her-yes i have a IRATE customer in here that will not leave the premisses (her calling 911)  Me-call the cops, i dont care. The Cops do not scare me, what scares me is how you are running this buisness!  There were guys in the back on my side, telling me to fight for my right  to rent a movie! They were making me laugh! They said that at least i was fighting for a cause!  She yelled at me some more........ and i told her that i would wait outside for the cops! and sure enough i waited! He showed up and i told him my peace and he went and listened to the bitch inside!  Anyways as you can see i didnt go to jail!   BUT,  i am not going to pay 25 bucks for a damn dvd that i did not  lose! They want a new one im sure, when the one that i rented was not new! AHHHHHH  Those people in that buisness are such liers and screwed up anyways. If i knew that i could take it to court and win I WOULD! mabye i can, get a lawyer to get a copy of the tape that was recording that day, from noon when we dropped it off to when i left about 11 last night. For all i know she could have stole it!   Needless to say that i am still awaiting a call from her boss, and i am not through with this fing battle!    in other news i went to my first YOGA class today, loved it! I might get Jason into it with me!

      I have semi-omitted my blog for awhile, but i am trying to get back in the fashion of it.  Last night i really didnt do much, i watched the Presidential Debate. The rest of the evening i read my book and caught the west wing once or twice. I finished my book last night (4 blonds).  A very simple evening. I think that i am going to start going to Yoga, if it does not cost me an arm and a leg. There is a place that is walking distance from my house and i noticed that they had a yoga sign up. So i will pop in there tonight or mabye tomorrow and see what its all about, and what the price is. I need to walk Mika today, well carry her in her new bag. I need to go walking for myself, that is really what this all boils down to, ha.   I wrote my dad an e mail yesterday or the day before giving him some instructions on some things. I wonder how his health is doing, i have tried to convince him to go see a doctor, but thats like pulling teeth. All i can do is tell him to go and thats about it. But i am glad that i got to talk to him, i love him very much.   Talked to my mom (texas) this week as well and she is doing well, exept she seems to be having some tummy problems. Its been hitting her for about a month now, of sharp pain in her tummy and sometimes it sticks around and sometimes it does not. She is in the same boat as i am when it comes  to my dentist tho'. She has to wait until Jan. before she gets some money again on her Insurance. Bastard insurance people, i  tell ya, we could do so much better if someone would get off their ass.   I went out to eat lunch today, Jason Eric and i went to McCalisters. I had a spud and some soup, the soup was supa good. We went out to eat yesterday too, and its odd for us to go out so much, because of money and all.   Speaking of money, im siked to see my new account in action.  Listening to the Counting Crows (august and everything after). I love this cd and it calms me. Good for the work day blues. Jason gets to take off the next couple of days in the morning and come in about lunch, im glad that he is able to get this rest. mabye he will be up for doing  things in the night time.....  I have not been on RP very much lately, im slipping i guess....  Thomas and Robert have faded on me, they seem to not have that much contact here recently. Life must be picking itself back up in their neck of the woods.  Well i must go and get back to work!  HOGS VS TEXAS THIS WEEKEND! GO LONGHORNS!!!!!!!!!! HOOK EM HORNS

      Surprise Surprise as i posted on Thursday that i wished it was Friday, sure enough a miracle did happen! Afternoon rolled around and all the toilets in our building would not flush, well i was wondering why we had no running water. Then the news finally came around that the construction guys hit a water maine and there you have it! It was about 2 and a half to three hours later when we were told that the Health Dept. was shutting down our huge building, i think that my eyes actually glazed over!! SO there you have it i was able to have another 3 day weekend. I sprinted out of there like there was no tomorrow, and didnt once think to look back!   I woke up on Friday morning knowing that i was lucky to not have to drag my ass into work, and as i approched the front door and opened it....cool air! Friday turned out to be the perfect day to have the day off. It was blue skys and about 75-80. I enjoyed the whole day and never took it for granted. I went and did some running around. I went to a new bank over by the house and jason helped me open up another banking account since i didnt have the cash myself. Thats really awesome for reasons that i cant even get into. We had lunch together, and called eric to tell him the plans for the night. Talked to my dad! Jason and i went to Barnes, and he bought me my new book (4 Blonds)    urlLink Barnes & Noble.com - Book Search  .  Joni and Charity Invited us over to there house to chill and we were ready to go. This appt was awesome, it was a upstairs and downstairs and had stained glass. It was originally a church that someone took and converted into appts. it was awesome. Dan and cylinda also came over and we all chilled and laughed. About midnight we get hungry and head over  to the IHOP. They got some food and i ate a couple of bites of what Eric didnt eat.   Saturday we got up and jason and i went to the local animal shelters. Not that we were gonna get anything, but we wanted to look. It was jasons idea and i thought it was an awesome ass idea, he made me smile. I went to my moms, she was having that big Poker tournament. She has 12 people show up and a hundred bucks a person. Winner gets the whole pot! 1200. I was the waitress and pulled  in some tips myself! Then i left to meet Jason and Eric to go shopping. We went to Old Navy of course, thats my store! And we all dropped close to a hundred dollers in there. Eric dropped a little over that, ha. We headed back over to my moms to see how it was going and they were still going at it, there was about 4 people left.   After that we headed off to Discovery, its an awesome club. We watched two drag shows and had some drinks. I even got eric to dance a little up on the plat form with me, and jason was up there too. I was happy that Jason was enjoying himself, he likes that kind of music. That made shelle happy! We left there and got home about 4am.  Sunday we were up and i layed around the house with Jason, then went to Subway for the two of us. After watching some more History Channel, i got up and took Mika to pets mart in her little bag. She was so cute! She got plenty of compliments about herself, so now she has a big head. Came back and Eric was there. Eric brought his Vette this time, and Eric and I went for a drive to Maumelle. We drove around looking for houses and enjoyed the weather. Came back and All three of us orderd Chinese Food and rented two movies.  The hunted.....    urlLink Hunted, The (2003)  and Real women have curves.....   urlLink Real Women Have Curves (2002)   RWHC.. was a fantastic movie, it reminded me totally of how my mom treated me growing up about my size and what not. (might be why i have the problems i have now)  Then Eric went home, and i started to read my new book....then fell asleep.

      The last two days have not been much to talk about, just pissed off all the time. It is true that women think way too much and sometimes expect people to do certain things, but arent men guilty of the same ever so often? yeah, thats right, we are not to blame.  I have done way too much thinking the last couple of days, and that might prove to not be a good thing. When i do not get answers or the same thing that pisses me off continues, i pull myself from it and think about it. Ideas, assumptions and so on are not going good right now.  I was able to talk to Thomas last night also, and that was such a break from the goings on. He makes me laugh and hes awesome.   I have not eaten for awhile now, no dinner last night and little for lunch yesterday. Im not eating lunch today either, i hope that my body can hold up and not get sick on me. I am just not in a mood to eat and dont really think that i deserve food all that much.  Have had no contact from the family, mom and so on.   It has been just me and Mika really, and she gets cuter and cuter every second.  Im sitting in my room on lunch break, staring out the windows. Its so nice, there is a breeze and the sun kisses every thing it touches outside. My room is so comfy, and i dont think that it would bother me to stay in here every night. Mabye just change my damn life for good, but would that change who i am as a person? yeah, it would.   I would like to make my own cds in my room, or at work for that matter. I would like for J to send me those damn pictures that he took with his camera. I didnt even ask him, i sent him an e mail yesterday, and he has done nothing so far. Its all about when he eels about getting around to it. But me, i jump at his requests, i need to stop doing that shit fo' sure.  What happened to the strong independent women that once had this flesh?

      DAMN longhorns, they let me down like no ones biznazz. I have never seen them play that bad in i dont know how long! sigh.... and i made a bet with a bud at work that if the horns lost then every time i saw him i would have to "call the hogs" and if i won, he would have to do the horns symbol. It was his damn idea, i should have said no, but i was confident, so yes, tomorrow alot of people at work will be on me.  I have been reading others blogs sitting in my room with underworld on *twist*. Very groove song and a groove day to play. Its so nice outside i wish i had a damn good laptop and some Mocha.......  I have not been drawing or do much latley, Thomas might get onto me for that, but im glad some one has to keep me in shape!  eh, i guess i will go and enjoy the rest of the weekend!  Iowa won against Iowa state, at least i won there, actually they beat their asses off!  Im outta here....Kiss kiss to the readers...

      What can i say, the days since the last post have been a blur. I dont remember much and i might like it that way.  Last night was West Wing night, yup it finally arrived! The new season has begun, so i am no longer avaliable on Weds. (not like i ever really was) heh. I was introduced to Bear Share, for looking purposes only, ahem.  I have not talked to my mom or dad in  the past couple of weeks and i guess its due time for a ring. I talked to Ken last night and i am still fighting with AOL and there Bullshit, even though i have been on DSL for months now.  The kitchen is not quite complete, but it will stay that way for awhile. I hate having  the house in dis-aray.   Jason has been in a mood today, i dismiss it, i know that i get into moods and i can be hard to deal with. Not paying attention and snotty faces from his others....not too high on my list of "oh arent you darling". I deal and i cope and move on, shit wont change.  Sabina needs to be washed and she needs to be cleaned on the inside for sure.  Mika is happy as can be, i gave her a treat at lunch, figured it was only fair  (package)  Work is so long and quite, kinda like it, kinda dont.  I need to go on vacation, away from everybody, i mean everybody. I would come back ready to rule the roost once more.  Made a Cd for myself yesterday  Its called "FEMALE RESTRAINT"  Here are the Tracks.......  *The Donnas- Spend the night *Heart- Magic Man *Sheryl Crow- My biggest mistake *Leona Naess-~ *Beth Orton-Faith will carry *Evanescence-Whisper *Lush-Hypocrite *Lamb-Trans fatty acid *Tori Amos-Raspberry swirl *Frou Frou-Must be dreaming *Garbage- #1 Crush  Only eleven, i know......but i wanted to make it simple and full of yummy.  Made Sam a DVD of John Mayer (Any Given Thursday). He made me the new Dave Mathews CD and bonus cd.  I have talked to Thomas some, and have not heard from Robert since he dropped by. Is he mad at me?  Living my life, one corner at a time.....

      Friday, Robert dropped by and it was a total surprise. Although i was happy to see him, i was tired and wanted to read. So i did not end up going out and having sushi, sniff sniff.  Saturday, Jason and i went to see Once upon a time in Mexico, it was a good movie.  I got some weird idea to paint the Kitchen, so we went and got some paint and there you have it, im still painting! Yeah, its not a small job. And who was i to think that the kitchen would be easy?  Sunday, we laid around and then i painted majority of the day.   Went to barnes and got my new Redbook mag!

      I am having a peaceful time at the house tonight, Jason is gone at one of our parks working. Its funny, because normally i dont have a problem with him being gone but i guess i just didnt feel like being alone tonight. I have pondered around the house and cleaned up the kitchen. I had some breakfast  food for dinner, i lit a candle and ate at the table by myself.   I think that i will read a book, or watch some tv. I Talked to Thomas tonight, and went to see my mom. Thomas really listens to me, and that means alot to me. He dosent seem like  a bullshitter and watches out for other peoples feelings.  I miss my dad, and would love to see him!  Bob wrote me an e mail and gave me some good points on making Sushi!

      Jims sister is still hanging on but still in very bad shape, we shall see where tonight brings her.   In other news, the job is hectic and the people are still oblivious to there surroundings. I hope to have a garage sale this weekend, i already dont want to, but im so tired of all that crap! Mabye i can make a couple of bucks, and what i dont sell will go in the trash. It will for sure not come back into the house. I feel sorry for Jason because i will be asking him to get up early again  this weekend to help me with the money for the sale. I got him up early last weekend to go to garage sales. My luck just like last time months ago, it will try and rain and i will have to cancel it and the crap will sit in the house for another week or so. Our house is not big enough for crap to sit around, trust me. Plus im trying  to paint the house, so this puts a strain on me.  Losing weight and several people at the office have noticed and it makes me feel good. Sam might be going to another job, so he may no longer work here. I will miss him, he makes me laugh and hes normal, and that is rare at my job!  Mika is fine as always, i have not taken her on a walk latley, im a bad momma.  I talked to my mom twice in the last two days, she has called and wondered why i have not come to see her. bad daughter!  Today for lunch, it was my idea to head out to the Dixie Cafe. I have not eaten there in a long time and i was craving chicken fried steak and gravy. Some squash and some mac and cheese, would be good too.  And there rolls are wonderful, butter and honey. Jason does not like to eat there, so i asked him anyways on a whim, and he SAID YES! Mabye it was because i said that i would pay for it, ha. But we went to eat, and i was excited, because he actually went, then he ended up paying for it. I really was in total shock! Humm, dosent take much for me to go in shock, ha. It was an awesome gesture, and i loved it.  I guess i will close  for today, nothing exciting....

I have talked to Thomas quite a few times in the last couple of days, and its nice! I have not heard from Robert, mabye he has gotten to busy to chat.  The kitchen is almost finsihed and im glad, its a wreck! My room is a wreck and i actually sent Thomas pictures of the danger, ha.  Im outta here for now.......

      Its Saturday morning and i am up and quite awake for this time... Jason and i got up and went garage sale shopping, we laughed and joked around. We really didnt find much, i bought a book on the life of Barbara Streisand. Yes yes, i am a fan of hers, so i dont want to hear anything, heh. I grew up on her and Neil Diamond. ah yes, good ole times...  Right now i am watching squirrels out of my bedroom window, they are playing and running around all over the place. Its so neat to watch them find nuts and then cover them back up. Nature in all forms is quite remarkable.   Horns play the Sooners today......go horns!  Floridas game should be good, and Arkansas plays auburn i think...  We have several movies to watch this weekend, we got two more in from Netflix and Sam gave us two movies to burn for him, one i have not seen. Dreamcatcher by steven king.  SO i have a full weekend ahead, and Joni and Charity wanna hang out as well....  LOVE YOU DADDY!

      Last night i talked to daddy, he called be to bitch about my new tattoo that i had over the weekend. He was so funny! He said some things to me about what he thought when it came to me. like ... "i was the best thing that ever happened to him" and things like that. Made me feel really good and almost to a cry.  Today my tooth woke me up again at 6 and i got up and started to get ready for work. It kills me, this pain does. I cannot do anything about it and i have nothing but bad news that followes me when it comes to this damn subject so im gonna stop talking about it.   Today at work was a horribly long day, not because of the work, but the pain from my teeth. I wanna get drunk!  Jason has been away all day, and Sam has called to play.

      Work has been busy and MIS is having a bit of a tiff going on with the server situation. The days seem to be getting longer i can tell ya that. Jason has been sick for a week, he has stayed home from work about 4 days and if you know Jason you know he does not miss work. He is feeling a little better recently, and i hope that he gets over this crap (and does not share). We got in our John Mayer tickets and they are posted up in the house, im siked. Speaking of music, Jason just sent me a link for a signed Jeff Buckley poster on ebay. The poster is only going for about 400.00 dollers and there is still 20 hours to go. Damn, i know that i had that poster i would in no way sell it.eh.   I had to cancel a dinner with Thomas and i was afraid that he might be mad at me.  i just read an e mail from him and he said that he would make me a plate in my honor, very sweet. He understood that i had things to get done. In exciting news******** i played my first game of chess last night and i love it! I get frustrated with it, but i will get it down. I might be one of those people you see playing at a park!  Garage sale will happen this weekend and thats a fact! My mom (from texas) will be coming my way this month so i need to get some stuff done, and the house painted. I need to go see my dad and have a good cook out!  Yesterday was Sams last day here at work, and i miss him. Although im glad that he got a better job and i hope that he likes it. I met a nice guy through nerve, hes a geek and hes funny. (Vance)  I will be getting a new chair here at the office and damn its about time. Nancy is getting older and i want to hit her, and she is so bitchy and loud all the  time.   I want to go to the State Fair and since Jason does not like that stuff, i might make my mom go with me. Mabye i can get Ken to go. I havent hung out with him in quite the while. The West Wing did not show last night and it pissed me off! Weds is when Jason and I camp out on the couch and watch West Wing, and baseball.  Jason waxed Sabina and she is all good... I put my Oct. Nov. wreath on the door, so now i look all into the swing of things, heh.  I have seen where Robert has called me, i need to hit him up as well. Im 2 calls down on that, shame on me for sure.  My sister will be having surgery, i need to finally call her even though she was a bitch to me...  My room is semi-coming together and i would love to have my painting from Thomas.....sigh  Football season, oh yeah...Im kicking Jasons ass in the Collage pick on Espn, heh. Bout time for that.  Halloweeen costumes? damn, havent even given it a thought, sad sad sad...  anything else?..........Mika says hi to everyone.....

      I have just closed the book that I have been reading for the past week or so. I could not express how much I learned from this book, and realized things that I would have never thought about. A life's lesson learned from a 50 cent garage sale pick-up that. Jason looked at me and said "you would enjoy that book". Learning later that he has never actually read it himself, but im sure that he will. This book taught me lessons about myself, lessons about other people and lessons about life.  This does not come off as a self help book, this is where you live through other people and finally open your mind to realizations that people try to hide from.. About 15 min ago I closed the book for the first time on completion and had tears in my eyes, and found myself slipping in to a complete wreck. Maybe this book touched me so much because it reminded me of my father. My father is a damn good man, and I love him with every single beat of my heart. I would not be who I am without my fathers influence the small talks on the front porch and when no one else cared to listen, my dad always did. Advice from my father was always locked up and will be kept forever.   This books title is "Tuesdays with Morrie" by: Mitch Albom     urlLink Mitch Albom    urlLink Morrie Schwartz

      Just another Manic Monday, i wish it was a Sunday, thats my fun day....  Ah yes, here we are in a start of another week and yet we always wish we could go back  to the day before. Work has been good today with all that it could have been to say the least. I have a little over an hour to go. Tonight i will be going to some of my old stomping grounds with my ex (Ken) and playing pool. I miss the game so much, but im nervous about getting back into the scene that i was once in. Not nervous as in its a bad scene, but just the people and the whole surroundings. I dont want everyone to talk shit because Ken and i are no longer together and now here we are showing up together. People are people and they will always talk about other people. I will have to understand that and go on.  I was able to chat with Thomas a tad today, more like a second before he had to go to work. No news from Sam, but i didnt expect any. Jeremy has said that he misses me today. Jason is on and off weird, but its better than being a total weird. Last night i got the T.V. moved into my room, and to tell you the truth i may never come out of my room anymore. If i had cable hooked up in there then yeah, it might be kinda hard to tear me away from the room. (until i needed a smoke, dont smoke in the house)   Today was the first meeting of the X Committee, this is going to be a long drug out deal and im sure that you will hear more of it. I was in it last year and they put the pressure on me this year to do it again. Without me i dont know what it would be, eh.  Need to get Sabina looked at, hers having problems..  I had my garage sale this weekend and it went rather well, good for shelle.

      This weekend like most have gone to a total race for time. I have no idea of where the time goes and yet, some of the time I feel like I have nothing to do to pass the time. For what reason or another I always seem to stumble upon articles that are about older women wishing that they were young again. About them losing their looks and speaking that no one seems to notice them. Knowing that there is life when I get older, but im scared of getting older none-the-less.I need to get into shape before it gets harder than it already is. I am almost 24 years old and have no clue where my life is going, that scares me also.  I wish I was a sex symbol, I wish that people looked at me and would think about endless romance..wishing gets me nowhere.  Work is hectic and appears to only worsen come tomorrow. Mondays are bad enough and there is tension at the office. This weekend I went to Kohls and bought a watch, something that I have not had for years. Its nice and I totally dig it.  Right now I have pretty women playing and I am lounging around. Its my fav movie and it lets me escape into romance that is no longer alive in this world. (money helps with romance) My mom (Texas) is here in town staying at Queen Wilhelmena and I will take off a day to go see her. Im excited about that, I have not seen her since last April. She will be here a week, but I will only see her for a day. I need to go see my dad, her misses him.  I missed the fair, this is the first year that I have missed it since I have lived here. I was going to go with ken and I kept putting it off. I seem to be very good at putting things off.  I wonder how Thomas's dinner was, I hope it was swell.  Robert, THANK YOU for leaving me a message! I am afraid to call, I don't ever know when you are going to be home.     What ever happened to guys sending you flowers for no reason, or opening your doors. I would not like it all the time, but hey surprise me every now and again!   Sigh* Mika wont stop being sneaky with the food...  Joni and Charity called me and wanted to hang out, I did. We went to watch the hogs game at the bar, and then I hung out with them later that night.   Pretty Women calls me, so I must get off here....

      Last night i went to hang out and have some drinks with mom at Baseline bar. Met her up there and she was wearing a red leather jacket with a red leather skirt, black tank top and some black suede (to the knee) boots. I thought she looks dressed to kill even though i am not a fan of leather. Went out there and started shooting some on the back table and as much as i would prefer no one to step towards me they always do. I had this 27 year old come to me and want  to play some pool, before i knew it he was telling me about him breaking up with his girlfriend of a year for good. That she was a fruit and that she does not even want to work, but wants everything money can buy (more like she expects it). He was telling me about him having two kids already with two diffrent women, and how he never sees both. Of course growing up in the condition that i did, i told him my opinion. He said that he does not see them because the mother hates him and does not want him around the kid even though he pays child support. And he said that he is going to just do it that way, because thats what she wants. My opinon to him was, he should not do that, that he needs to put forth the effort into seeing his kids. One of 5 right now and dosent know who the daddy is, humm, not right.I told him that now that he has a kid, its not about him and her anymore, its about him and his kid. Of course i doubt that it changed anything, but i felt that he needed to know how-me- as a women alone thinks about the situation. Needless to say that he has made the same mistake twice, and mentioned that now he is snipped. eee gads...  So he had beers on top of some shots and drowned himself in his sorrows, while i beat his ass game after game in pool. heh  Came home and took a shower and then went  to bed, freezing in the house. Had to hunker under the covers with Mika.  Jason spent the night at Degray, he was down there working for awhile. I have not heard from him today so far.

      Whoa, i have missed a whole week of this. Im getting bad about it, someone needs to whip me into shape.  Went to Queen Wilhelmena this weekend to see my parents from Texas. I took Mika, and had a great time, i went up there and spent  the night. Its about 5 min. down the road to Oklahoma, so its a neat place. Queen Wilhelmena is a state park for those of you who have never been or are not from Arkansas.   Take a look see.....   urlLink Arkansas State Parks   Pathetically enough i have only been to the following parks (8)..seeing how there are 51 state parks!  * Petit Jean *Queen Wilhelmena *Mt. Nebo *Mt. Magazine *Pinnacle *Degray *Lake Catherine *Ozark Folk Center     I actually went out and got a cell phone, i figured that i am hardly ever at home so if people need to reach me then they can. Plus my parents and Jasons parents both live out of state, and this makes it better for them. I was also seeing myself in situations that a cell phone would come rather handy, so Jason and i broke down and got them.  Monday was a wierd day and im glad its over. Went to play and watch pool last night.  Jason will be working at a park for the next two days so i will not be seeing him for awhile. He left about an hour ago, and hes not looking forward to it. (mika will miss him)  This morning i was woke up rather madly weird. Mika kept growling and barking, and i shushed her a couple of  times. I could hear some dogs outside growling and carrying on. I shushed her once more and she didnt quite, i had had it. I jumped out of bed and went out side, there is a dog that lives across the street and its always in its back yard. And there is this guy that walks these two other dogs, but he never has them on a leash. In our area you have to have them on a leash. SO i jump out of bed and walk outside and there are two dogs trying to get to this other dog behind the fence, i go out in the street barefoot and try to shu them away. They were going nowhere. I marched back in the house and got a damn broom and took it out there to them and shued them away. It finally worked and i was surprised i didnt get attacked, they were mean looking. One was a german shepard and the other was a big black dog. So by the time that was done, i had 5 dogs barking and im sure the people around me were up. This was all at 700AM! SO thats how i was waken up, i let me tell you then next time i see that guy im gonna let his ass have it.   ok, im done for now.....bye

      What is this life for?  Does anyone even read this anymore, or do i really write it for myself like originally planned. This past weekend was Halloween and and it was wierd. I went to  a party on Halloween, and i left grossed out. There was this guy there and he thought he was so damn cute with his looks and comments. Needless to say i found him annoying and retarded from the get-go. He was going around and making fun of people but he thought he was cute. He was making fun of people that he didnt even know. He was staring at me majority of the night as he tossed back beers and shots. Trying to avoid any interaction or eye contact with the guy  i was stuck in one spot  the whole night. He was drinking and drinking then went from being smartass to depressed drunk. Tear in my beer shit, being loud saying that he was a real mother-fucker and what not. Blah Blah Blah I was getting ready to leave and he stumbles over and put his hand on my head and holds my hand and says that he loves me. I over looked that because he was drunk. Then he leaned in and whisperd real close to my ear "when you go to bed tonight, think of me" and leaned forward and gave me a nasty kiss on my neck. I was so grossed out, i went home and hopped in the shower. My neck was so sore from where i had scrubbed it. What is wrong with guys today? They have no concern what so ever. I cant stand a drunk anyways, then really not one who cries in his beer.eh. He is lucky that my dad was not there, my dad would have beat his ass for pulling that shit.  Got up Saturday morning and left the house about 6 or so. Went to take Sabina to get her fixed up as a surprise to J. He thought that i was going garage sale shopping. We spent the say running the streets and playing. Saturday night i was invited to go to a party with Thomas but i didnt go. I am sure that he will no longer invite me places out there, because i never seem to go.sigh, he is probaly hates me. Later that night about 9 something, i went to see Luther at market street. BADASS MOVIE.     urlLink Luther   Sunday morning i got up and mom wanted me to call her, so i did. I went over there and we hung out all day long it was so damn awesome. We hit every dollar store from here to Benton and it was so much fun. We had lunch at the cracker barrel. We went into a tattoo shop and i wanted to get my belly button re done, i thought that i had let it close up. Turns out that it just needed a little push thru and it was done. So Eric only charged me for the ring. MY MOM ended up getting a tattoo, it was her first. Thats right she is no longer a virgen, ha. She got it on the back of her shoulder blade. It says "Wild at heart" is awesome lettering and it has a heart with  a vine. It looks really good. Im glad that i was there when she had it done. Eric did an awesome job.  Jason has not been paying much attention to me, and thats not cool. I go with the flow and adjust, but its not cool and i dont know how long i can take it. Is this just a rerun?  Have had no news from Robert, and Vance just cracks me up. Sam has not gotten in touch, no Photoshop for him. And Steven says nothing about the movies, so mabye they worked! Went to see Scary movie III last night, it was funny.  I guess that im going to cut this off.   Shelle misses her painting that she has never seen  I want to crawl in a whole and stay there.  Cancelled pool tonight with Ken...

      Friday and the start of 2 days without nag nag nag.....  Kelley found out that she got the other job. I hope that i can move into that job and get some more money and experience under my belt. Its alot to take on, because i think that they want to combine my job and her job together. But i can do it, and i will do it!  Tomorrow is Mika and Me morning and then i will be seeing John Mayer that night! Thomas, Jen and Robert will be coming to town tomorrow so im excited to see them. They will be coming up here to do something with their portfolios and to help at the blind school. I think thats totally rad of them to do that.  Tonight i guess i dont have much planned but to chill and go walking. I have been walking for about 4 days now and i hope that i learn to like it soon, ha.   I hope that i can get some christmas shopping done this weekend, even though im so broke. I need to get started before i do like i always do and do it at the last min.  Im outta here........for you thomas.....

      Well here i am on this Tuesday night. I did some running around today and have settled in for the night i guess. Tonight i went and walked at the track that is by my house. I walked the streets around me a couple of blocks out and then headed to the tracks. The night was so wonderful and i had Sarah in the portable cd player. After i was done walking i sat on the bleachers for about 15 min or so and just let the wind blow through my hair. It was sooo nice outside and prob. the last good day of the year. I sat there and thought about the things that are going on and that are not going on. I figured that i would start  taking better care of my body, i started one of those stupid calenders that is now on my fridge. Its so i can keep track of when i go walking and what i really do.  I went to Bedford Camera today to ask about getting pictures done for Mika and I. Im totally excited about it and cant wait. I hope that i at least take a good one and that Mika will face the camera! I will share with all of you when they are done. I will have them done this Saturday at 8:30 in the morning and that means that i will be getting up early, eh.   I gave the wreath to my mom and she said that she loved it. Of course that is a mom tho', i wonder if she really did, mabye i am being to hard on myself...who knows..  Thomas called me when i was hanging out with my Mom and Sis, and Robert has yet to call.  Christmas is coming up around the corner, THATS RIGHT!!! its my fav. holiday ever... I will be going to Iowa and Texas. Jasons parents and then mine. I love to give presents and this holiday is wonderful. The christmas music the hot coco, the lights...love it.  We will be getting Sabina fixed soon, and she will have a new paint job to flaunt around!  what else...humm... JOHN MAYER THIS SATURDAY!!!

      This weekend was an OMG weekend, found some stuff out about my real mom that i was shocked about and would prefer not to repeat it. Lets just say that i had a cry fest and Jason was awesome enough to be there for me. Took care of my mom and my sister while they went out and got plasterd drunk. That night ended about 2:30, eh. I got hit on several times and it was quite annoying how they were to each other. Breaking in on conversations and what not. Was bought three roses and that was cool, shelle loves flowers and the last person to be that nice to me was Thomas.   Went to see Mystic River this weekend, it was good, but i guess i expected more.....(women always expecting more, ha) Really awesome people in it!   urlLink Mystic River   Robert wrote me an e mail and i was happy, i had not heard from him in awhile and was starting to worry. He seems to be doing peachy and is still book buying. Just like me, buying books and having no where to put them all. Lifes greatest treasures.  I made a wreath for my mom to hang on her door, i was hoping that it would turn out. I plan on putting more photos in my account so that i can share them with all of you. I will prob. try to work on that tonight, get something done, ha.   Tomorrow i dont have to work because it is Veterans Day, i wish i had a flag because i would fly it high for sure.  Jason left to go to Degray last night and will return on Wednsday....Mika misses the guy already.  OMG~~~~~~~~~~ SARAHS  McLACHLAN'S NEW CD ROCKS!  I was a huge fan to begin with, but she continues to plain and simple amaze me. If you have not heard it, yeah,  you need to. Her video for fallen rocks as well.   urlLink Sarah    Well, thats all for now....bye bye, kiss kiss

      Monday night I sit here with a smile on my face. Not that anything over the top has happened just a wonderful comfortable feelings, its quite nice. To put the rewind button on fast , here I go.  Saturday was so damn awesome. I got up early to get Mika and I ready for pictures. We headed over there and she was the best dog anyone can ask for. She was so perfect and posed for those pictures like she was born to do it. The pictures turned out great and im so proud of her. After that I went and tried to Christmas shop, but I picked a few things up for myself and one for Jason. (I already gave it to him) Im a sucker... About 12:30 I was starved but I figured that I would wait seeing how I was supposed to see Thomas, jenny and Robert at 1:00. I went home and sat on the couch. I waited and waited, I fell asleep on the couch and what woke me was my cell ringing. It was Robert, turns out that he was the only one that could make it. He came by and I hopped in the car and we went to have lunch at the Olive Garden and it was nice. It amazes me how much Japanese he really does know. Its quite intersting. I looked at his art work over lunch and talked about his day showing his portfolio. He took me home after that because I had to go pick up my proofs from Bedford.   That night YES YES YES was John Mayer and Jason and I were off to the concert. We sat in the floor section. The concert was badass and im so glad that I was able to go. John was an absolute dream and damn he could play the guitar. I stood the whole time, shook my hips and sang every song! If that concert comes out on DVD, I will be sure to buy it! I wish that every one could go to something like that. Jason was awesome! I think that our next move is to save money and travel to see concerts. hell yeah, im dreaming!  Sunday was a gasp of every thing wonderful. I slept most of my morning away on the couch and then Jason said "get up, we are going out and I have it planned". That is music to my ears for someone to be that spontaneous and happy about doing it. I have needed a new pair of black boots forever now and kept putting off getting me some cause of money reasons. He took me to my fav. store *right now* Kohls. He bought me a new pair of black boots and I was shocked. After that we went to some shops and then he drove to the Rave (theater). I was wondering what he had planned for us to see. I looked at the sign of what was playing. Then it hit me that he was taking me to see that movie that I was waiting to see. LOVE ACTUALLY. The movie was better than good and I would watch it over in a sec. Its a wonderful movie, and all should see.    urlLink love actually   Monday (today) was a fast moving good day at work. Im hoping to move into a better paying job, so I am forcing myself to learn stuff quick. Today, and the whole weekend was gloomy outside, but I had the biggest smile!  That's it for now......Listening to Sarah once more

      It hits me every year, the breaking down of the family and who will get mad at me this year. I have a dad 3 hours from here, a mom in Texas, another mom 25 min from me, Plus all of Jasons family in Iowa. It gets nasty, when it comes to who i can see every year. And it always gets to the point where im crying and depressed from the guilt trips that people lay on me. Its a point of life, and lets face it Jason is a rare lucky one whos family is still together, all in one place.   Jason and I got up at 5 am the day after thanksgiving and got our game face on. We were ready to take on the crowds and nasty nasty people. Hit Starbucks on the way to Best buy our first stop. Lets just say that it was a long day, but we got alot accomplished! Started at 5 and ended at 2. And then i had to go back to Garden Ridge about 4 for the 3rd time...  My Thanksgiving was ok, like every year. Had it at moms house here and it involved family that i love to roll my eyes at. Screaming kids with mothers that dont beleive in spanking, ah geez. I would wear a kids ass out quick..heh. These kids are hyper kids at that, going up to people and just screaming, sometimes they throw in a kick before running away. Hell yeah i would bend a babys butt over my knee, with a quickness! No pain no gain, right?  Today (thomas would be proud) i cleaned my room. It looks the best its ever looked, very groovy. Did the dishes and cleaned the kitchen. Picked up Mika's poop from the front yard and got the leaves all together. I was busy like crazy and im supa happy that its done. Now i can enjoy it and feel im somewhat free.  I still have presents to wrap, i did some of them yesterday.  I will be going to Texas and Iowa soon for Christmas.....  Will post laters....

      Oh Christmas tree oh Chritsmas tree how lovley are thy branches... Jingle Bells Jingle bells Jingle all the way Silent night holy night Rocking around the christmas tree is a happy time of year Rudolph the red nose reindeer had a very funny nose Feliz Navidad  Yes, yes yes yes yes I am in the Christmas spirit and i cant wait till the time comes that i will be opening and giving presents.This happens to be my very fav. time of the year. Mika and i went and had her pictures taken today with SANTA! She is the cutest thing i sware. Half of the proceeds go to help animals in shelters and so on, so i was glad to give my buck up. They have a station on the radio that i listen to, its christmas music nonstop, heh, im a dork!  Work has been CRAZY, i have been doing 2 peoples job and its stressful. A lady quit in our department and i took it over. I love it, but i rarley have time for myself, its wild. Charlotte and i went to Degray to the Gift show. We have a guy that worked for State Parks and he had Cancer and was very sick. He went to texas to get treated and is back now doing very good. He has beaten the cancer!! Now he is weak and can barley stand, but he is on the way to recovery. So we held a silent auction in his honor and raised 4400 dollers for him. It was awesome, but i know that does not even pinch his medical bills, but its more than what he had! I spent the night down there on weds, and came back to work on Thursday....  I am head of the Christmas Committee this year, like the last. I make sure that it gets pulled off. I am in charge of the: decorations food familys that we will be helping, 8 to be exact toys clothes canned food drive and begging for donations...  yeah. cant ya see why i seem to have no time!  My christmas shopping is about over, i have a few people to get stuff for, and then im done! I hope that i can see my dad before christmas, i have gifts for them too!  Well i guess thats it for now...  THANK YOU for my awesome christmas card Robert.....

      What am i doing right now?....Im watching the snow fall. Yup, thats right, its snowing here, and its nice  *for now*. I like it when its falling and not sticking, but the Ice to follow is not welcome as far as i am concerned. Ah well, ya take what you can get.  Grandma is in the hospital. Mom, sis, and i went to see her today. Both of her lungs are full of fluid, and she is running fever. Her blood suger is really high and she is having problems breathing. She is only 69, and that would be rather young.. I hope that she pulls this thru.  Jason was supa nice tonight, he took me out to eat, and rented 5 movies: 23 dollers mind you. Its a good thing that we rent from NETFLIX (link to the right of my blog). We just wanted to go grab some at Blockbuster. (call us crazy) Her is what we got!  1.   urlLink Seize the day  2.   urlLink Owning Mahowny  3.   urlLink XX/XY  4.   urlLink Sonny  (James Franco is steamy and his smile can truly melt someone, or me) 5.   urlLink Legally Blonde 2   And the latest from Netflix:   urlLink La Vita e Bella  (Life Is Beautiful)  This is a really awesome movie...I would say you should see this one.   Thats all for now, waiting on a package in the mail and wondering if Mika will play in the snow with her mom, heh.

      Good Evening blogger.....  Today was a busy day at the office, like it has been recently. Today was get extra mad at stupid people day, heh. Sometimes they just need to be put in their place, sometimes. Christmas is among us and i can feel it a little more every day... Tonight i completed the Jason shopping! I finally got my last package from fedex. When i came home there was nothing on my door and no package. I knew that today it should have been here, if not yesterday. So i called up the company, and they said that it showed they tried to make a drop off at my house today. Well was there anything on Shelles door? nope.. SO i went to fedex tonight to get it, and told the lady there that the only way i knew it was there was because of the company, that they didnt leave a doorthing on my door. She said "that seems to be happening alot latley" UMM YEAH, how about lets fix that problem? eh well anyways, was kinda mad about the condition that the box was in, but hopefully i wont have damaged goods!  Just got threw watching the Billboard awards on TV. While Paris Hilton was on stage talking, someone in the audience screamed out "Paris is a Hoe". uh oh, i bet she didnt like that. Although i will admit i laughed and thought it was funny, im sure there is nothing on that tape that i or ALOT of people out there have not done,cmon! She is just catching slack because she is loaded and somewhat of a star. Now when it comes to being smart.....yeah, im leaving that one alone. Celine dions hips in that dress were tragic, and jessica simpson needs to lose the bangs. HA, now that i have talked about others, lets talk about me, that could be more intresting...hehehe   ok, ok, So we had some snow in the north part of our small simple state today. I hope it stays up there and does not venture here. Mika says hello, and im outta here....

Also Lilly on Radio Paradise makes sweet stuff (jewelry). She is so awesome to send me some to see if i dig it! If you have shopping that you need to take care of, tell me, and i will tell her that you are intrested in seeing her work! She does it for a hobby and from comments in the forum does a groovy job! She is just a sweet person.   Thomas made me laugh my butt off tonight, he is so funny and drugged up on antibiotcs! Hes funny..... His bud is coming into town soon, that will be intresting..  Talked to dad yesterday, hes doing good and working too hard. He says that winter might be moving in soon!  Gotta run and get back to RP!

      Its Sunday, wasnt it just Sunday the day before yesterday? Ah well, who am I to get lost in time, after all time is usually not on my side to begin with. This weekend has been relaxing and sweet. Not as cold as it could have been, but can catch a nipples eye at night. As long as the sun stays out during the day, this Texan thinks its bearable. Very quiet and slow weekend as appose to the constant hustle and bustle of the upcoming work week. Christmas is way too far away and I am counting the days. YES I am a kid at heart, thank ya very much! There is nothing wrong with still believing in Santa *wink*!  Mika is sniffing around all the packages wondering where all her gifts are. And the living room is packed with them, kinda makes you wonder how much money you have really spent on this stuff! I received the Barnes and Noble membership catalog in the mail, and thought that I would put an X by everything I wanted (so I would not forget). Yeah, well the marker almost ran out of ink, lol.   Last night 10:00 store run was for: Cookie Dough Cokes Hair dye  Oh yeah, im such an interesting girl, I tell ya!  Got to run, see ya

      Watched the Gospel of John, YEAH its good!Is it wrong to say that Jesus was sexy? (Bad shelle)   urlLink Gospel of John   Last night i also watched Mona Lisa Smile (at the rave).  urlLink Mona Lisa Smile   For those that do not live close to me, there is only two movie theaters that i normally go to:  urlLink The Rave    urlLink Market Street  (Independent Films)  My mom(texas) tried  to do the same thing as she did last year. Saying that she does not matter to me and blah blah blah. I finally broke and bucked up to her for once in my life. And she apologized, sorda. Thats all it took for me to be halfway happy about the situation. If you read back to last Christmas i might have written about it, eh.  In other news, last week i went with Thomas and Robert to pick up their bud Josh from the airport. I actually had a good time hanging out in the airport for about 2 hours or so. We just hung around and talked, made fun of each other and looked out onto the runway. It made me feel like i was traveling, but was a tease at the same time. The airport is a funny place all in all. A airport is my fav. place to people watch, i like to imagine what they are thinking and where they are going and what kind of people they are all around. Thomas would try to guess what people had in their bag. It was funny. Robert just kind of hung around and went with the flow of things. I actually had my feelings hurt, perhaps it was something stupid, but at the time, it hurt my feelings, so it matterd. I didnt eat before i left with them because i thought that we were going to get something to eat. Well the place was closed inside the airport at like 8:30. (Yeah our little airport sucks) Im used to my DFW! But there is a waffle house that is close and Thomas and i were hungry. Robert looked a little worried and really not up to the idea, so i said that we will wait until josh got there to eat. So i waited another hour or so. Then josh arrived and we were walking out to the car. When they first picked me up from the house i was going to sit in the back adn let Thomas and Robert up front. They insisted that i sit up front, so i said ok. Well when all of us were getting in the car to leave the airport, Robert said "Im sorry michelle, but i have to say that josh gets shotgun". I said nothing and went to the back seat. Not to mention that all they were going to do was take me home, they still had another hour to drive or so. Humm, i kinda found that a tad rude. But all in all i had no problem sitting in the back. Then Robert asked josh if he was hungry, he said that he really was not, but didnt flat out say NO ya know? Well i had been waiting for a little over 3 hours now to eat, so robert was like ok, and took me home. Didnt even ask if Thomas or I would like to stop somewhere. Im sure that josh would have not had a problem with hanging for about 30 min with us while we ate. I never get to see these guys that often anyways! So yeah, i had some grinding of the teeth going on. Mabye its because i am the type of person that always thinks of others before myself, i  mean everyone that i am with...I dunno, just kinda chapped my hide. Im over it...  I pulled out the little pictures that Thomas did for me a while back, and there wonderful. Christmas is almost here, and im siked! Mika looks around for her stocking. Jason and i went and got 4 new tires on Sabina today, they were well needed and road trips are coming up soon! Thats 450.00 gone.Dad western unioned me some money for my christmas presents since i would not be there on Xmas. He has nothing really to share, but yet gives me so much. It cause i am a daddys girl, and loving every min. of it! heh  Talked with Jeremy last night and he was wanting to hang out some time, but i dont know when i will be able too!Ken has been calling, and I have found some great people on nerve.com. Not bad for a week, ha.  Gotta run and get Santas tracking number, so i know when he will be on my roof top

      Sunday i have been lazy lazy, and i think that i deserve it! I have been laying around the house and ran with J to best buy to pick up a chair. His broke and it was actually kinda funny watching him sit in it tilting to the side and all the way down. My wicked humor per say.  I am back now, thinking about the busy upcoming work week, ugh. BUT that means that we will be getting closer to Christmas, thats how im looking at it now. I am having my first cup of Hot coco this year. YUMM!  Grandma is doing a tad better, but the doctor told her that it will get worse before it gets better, damn what a thing to say, heh.  Gotta run....bye bye

      The holidays are just about over and i have one stop to go before they really are. Iowa here we come, in a day or so i will be off to Iowa. To see family and friends, and mabye i will be able to hop on the Casino boat once more. Even if its only a couple of bucks that i spend its always a good time! Dallas was awesome and i stayed a tad longer than i normally would have. I had several friends leave there name and address for me. when i moved i left everyone behind and never looked back, it was just a bad situation. I contacted one bud named Dalores. She was my best friend back in the day and we had so much fun, hunting guys down and screaming at them. I met up with her after 3-6 years on no talking. It was crazy but very cool. She is now married with a kid! Every single one of my friends have kids and have been married or are now divorced. It was kinda crazy to go back years later and see people still living at their parents house with the same ride or the same life. Its like stepping back in time and seeing that nothing had changed,very strange. I had moved several times and have done alot of things since then. Just makes ya think! There is a picture of dalores and i in my photos!  I am back to find out that my fish is no longer alive, very sad for me, i loved that little guy. Mika went with me and we had a blast, i have some new pics of her as well!  Santa was good to me this year! Came back sick, sore throat, congestion, not nice shit!

      Thomas has put a boot to me once again about my blog, i have not been a good girl when it comes to getting this thing done in the proper manner. I went to my dads last weekend to have our christmas and i had a good time. I met his wifes son for the first time and hes not bad. He is 20 and recently moved here from New Orleans. He thinks the same way i do when it comes to this town just not moving fast enough. He lives with my dad and margie. He told me that my dad had a heart of gold and that he has helped him out so much. That he would do anything for him. He said that my dad did not even know him when he sent him money to get to his house, and that meant alot to him. He said that he considers my dad "his dad". That was really hard to grasp, seeing how i am his real kid. It was only hard to grasp for about 10 min or so. Im glad that others would consider my dad to be good enough for them.   In other news, jason has been gone alot and working too much. I have seen him about once this week and he should be back tomorrow night. Last night i went out and job hunted. I didnt even go home, i went straight to the stores. I got home about 8 and was pooped. I have been having headaches for the past week and thats not normal for me. I pretty sure its not because  im semi-sick, so im kinda wondering about it. When i bend over it just throbbs. Mika is happy to be home, but she misses all of her new friends that she has met on her journeys.  I went over and took pictures of jeremy Monday night after having dinner with mom. I have them on a cd adn ready to give to him. Micheal here at work, has the hots fo shelle. I can just tell, plus he told me that my voice was very sweet and soft. yeah yeah, put another one on my list.....but no one likes shelle!  Robert called me when i was in huntsville and wanted to know if i would meet up with Josh and him. Josh was going back to the airport and i hated that i was not able to tell him bbye like i would like to have. I told him to tell josh that im sorry that i missed him and that i hope to see him real soon. Talked to Thomas for awhile last night on the phone, that was really cool. I think it was the most that we have ever talked and it was supa sweet.  Ken has called a time or two and i have talked to him. I need to go over there and get my boxes, eh. My stepdad (moms hubby) sister died yesterday. She had cancer and her funural will be this saturday, i plan on going.   I have no idea what i will do tonight. I feel really funny since i have not eaten all day and its now 4:48. I need to get some crackers and mabye go job hunting once mroe. You can never have too many people wanting to hire ya right?  I have talked to Blake a time or two this week and every day on messenger...he wants to meet for coffee, hummm mabye, mabye not! He wants to see Mika's bag, and that makes him ok in my book , heh.  Gotta go and shut down the job......kisses

      Today is a very rainy and yucky day, figures that it would be on the weekend. I had an interview today for a 2nd job. I went in and looks like i have good chances of getting in, even tho they just hired some other people. I have to go on my lunch break on Monday and take my pee test. Office Depot is where i might be spending my extra time. I always said that i never had enough time to do anything, but NOW i will really never have enough time. Everyone needs money and i am no acception im afraid. I tried to make reservations at Oaklawn (Horse track) yesterday and they were all booked, maybe next weekend. I felt really bad that i was not able to hang out with Chris this weekend because of everything else i had going on. I hope that he is not too mad at shelle.   I have not talked to thomas yet this weekend, and thats odd, ehe usually keeps me in line. I will be going to watch the cooler tomorrow at Market Street. I will come back with the details on that later. Mika hates the rain, its too nasty on her fur, and her momma dont mind it on her fur that much, heh.

      Colors of Failure....  From pink to the black, to orange to the waste, and red to the fire flame. To the pupils as you dance in the reflection of my baby blues. You cant see me, but I can see you. The green grass grows too tall and the branch is too rough. Im tired of chasing this, im tired, im tired. Ive had enough. Don't flaunt your feathers my way, daddy said if you take me out you will pay. Pay for the faults you had when you were an 11 year old, and no pet in the pet store can own you. To the plush toy that caresses my breast, to the pillow that lays my mind to rest. You and only you, can do what you wanna do.

      One of those wanna bees  My stomach is nervous like the first person is a high trampeaze act. He opens the door and motions me in with a look of restlessness. The door closes behind me and i all i could do was swallow hard. he fumbles for his matches in his pocket, meant for the ciggs, in his other.He leans forward and lights a candle, forgetting about the switch that is less than a foot from him?He looks at me and motions "wait here" with his finger.He wanders into the room off his enchanting living room that is smaller than my bathroom. I take this chance to look around not moving my 7 1/2s. He reappears and takes my hand, leading me into the bedroom. There is a black light on and a comfy looking mattress on the floor. "Well, i guess hes not crazy enough to do the full light theory" she thinks to herself. He starts to take off his clothes and his hands get caught in his shirt, i cant help but give a smirk at his persistance. Just to help him i reach and take care of his belt buckle in case he injured himself in trying to do so. He throws his shirt on the floor, but not without hitting the lampshade on the way over and down. He takes my shirt and starts to lift it over my head, his hands are shaking and now it seems that i am in control, and he is nervous. Pulling it up and over he catches my earrings and i can remember my mom saying "if you wear big earrings they are just gonna get caught on things". The shirt is off and my bra is getting there. Now i am fully naked and he has his boxers to go. Noticing the bright yellow smiley Joe Boxer face with the tongue hanging out where his other friend is. I have to let an eye roll slip and suck it up. He looks really good though. His arms very nice and strong, the softness of his skin is almost magical, so it makes it all worth while. He looks at me like a puppy in a pet store and i attempt to remove his last article of clothing. We move closer and the whites of our eyes in the black light is freaky but sexy. We hit the bed and our bodies finally completley touch, pure softness of skin on such a rugged day. He stops  and looks at mewith such intent and says " "  You can pick the ending....  A) If i forget to tell you later, i had a really good time tonight.  B) Please hurry, she will be home soon.  C) Scream my name and never get tired!  D) Did you happen to catch the Knicks game?  This is just a story that can happen and end in any way. But no matter what you pick, keep in mind that all of these selections are happening all around us every day. Think about the one that turns you on the most. Happy Picking....  If you picked A- You are the romantic and in love with the fairy tale.  If you picked B- You are a risk taker and not happy in one way or another.  If you picked C- You are looking for a great fuck and a good exercize routine. And you fancy yourself.  If you picked D- You are not that worried about getting that some, and chances are you gamble. Because if you are that hard up for asking a girl during sex, then you bet high roller on that game!

      THRU THE EYES OF PURPLE~  For all the shades of purple can mean what you want them to mean. The purple passion of love, or mabye the purple passion of lust. The darkness in her heart, and that lump that forever grows in her breast. The wet eyelashes to the wet nail. The corrupt world and the farmers daughter. The depressed person to the "my life is never better" girl continuing to fool herself. To fool those that are not routine are simple. To fool those that are more than, is a life of dedication. To the salt water that tickles my toes, to the unforgiven kiss that you never recieved. A slap on the wrist for those that do not follow a life your mother would love to lead, a slap in the face once they realize the real you.  Ivyslush~  Thomas has introduced me to a new site....check it--   urlLink Friendster    I have introduced Ed, Chris and some others to this new thang.   Over the weekend i actually had a full nighter, yup didnt hit the sack all night. It was nice, made me feel like i was a kid again. I watched some movies over the weekend (big surprise) and here we go...   urlLink Assasination Tango  I would have  to give this film a 4 on a scale of 1-10. It had a good story, but they left out so much that you couldnt get into the whole movie. (mabye its just shelle) Tango is a awesome dance tho.   urlLink Whale Rider  not a bad movie i would have to say. A little slow, but over all kinda nice.You learn about things and wish you lived near the ocean, thats for sure. Scale of 1-10, i would give it a 7.

      Last night i came home and went in my room to read a bit, then about 7 or so i crashed out and fell asleep. I woke up later and watched a movie called Donnie Darko. Yeah its another badass one, very strange, but good. Jake is so damn tasty to me, and from certain angles, kinda looks like John Mayer, double yumm.   urlLink Donnie Darko   After the movie i went back to bed, and woke up early this morning, and went to Office Depot to see if they got my test results back. I dont think they have the test results back. I will start to look again, because they have had plenty of time, so if i get hired somewhere else then thats how its gonna be!  I am sitting in my room with the sun coming thru the window upon my screen and i sit here. I want to do so many things but yet i sit here. eesh maybe i should get off here and study some. Yeah yeah yeah thats what i will do because i can only better myself?

      The last couple of days have been a bitch and a half for me. I have no idea what it is or what brought it on, its just one of those things. Work has been busy before i even log in to my computer to stopping at five (because i have too) and knowing that i have tons of work to do. Then when i get home, i try to relax, but just cant get my mind at ease enough. I tend to get ticked off rather easy for things that i usually let go. Its been an up and down emotional rollercoaster and dammit i want off! Im hoping that this weekend will bring some comfort to my inner self and let things go. I have not been able to talk to many of my buds this week because i have been so busy, or so strained that i can't bare to talk. My ciggs have been quite the comfort, but even they start to taste bad, eh.  I still have not heard word on Office Depot, they better call me back because im not in the mood for this, ha. I know that it takes like 3-4 days to get my pee test results back and they told me to call them if they get too busy to call me. But, is today the day i should call? geez.. Im trying to rush me getting another job, im just plain crazy..  It is cold outside and damn when the wind blows its kinda no joke, but this is coming from someone who has not worn a coat this week! I would love a carmel mach. some ciggs, and a good surrounding.

      I have treated myself twice this week with a Carmel Mach. from Starbucks! oh yumm, i just cant help myself, but all the while studying HTML, so im not a total bad girl. Went to see the Cooler, yeah it was badass. You will know what im talking about when i say that the movie is such a peice of reality. The women that plays in the movie is very pretty, but she has flaws, she is not skinny and the model go get em type. Its easier for people to relate to, and i love it!    urlLink The Cooler   I have not started my new job yet, but i am still waiting on the call.  I have found this badass radio station on AM! Its like conspiracy radio, it scares the shit out of me, but i cant turn it off, YOU SHOULD TUNE IN!  The Bill o'reilly show is my fav.!   Its called KARN (news radio) on AM......check it out!  urlLink KARN

      Just found out today that my boss has cancer in his liver and chances are that he is not going to make it. That makes three people in our department that have got cancer in the last year. Now its really hitting close. I couldnt help my emotions when i was told and let my tears out. I have watched three people in my family die from cancer and several people here at work, there mothers have died of cancer and one within the last 2 weeks. My grandmother had breast cancer and my aunt had lung cancer, i have seen them suffer thru too much. So all i can do is pray and hope that everything will be ok.

      Today is a new day and a manic monday to boot. Thomas called me today to tell me that one of his paintings sold and he has some extra cash. Im so excited for him, i rushed to tell Jason about his good news. Sigh, and then only wish that i was as good as he is. He has no idea how badass he really is. Today i woke up in a good mood with little hondas jumping over the fence in my dreams. Went to work and it was major busy, and thats nothing new i suppose. Came home and ran to the answering machine and there was no message from Office Depot, (those bastards) so i changed clothes and ran off to fill out more apps. Went to Market Street to fill one out, i love it there and would love to work there. Turns out that a person he hired a week ago , is looking for a full time and wont be there long. He said that he wants me, but do i wait? crap i need money NOW! That person might be there 2 days or 2 months from now. I have to make money for my car, so i cant wait. Chances are i will be screwed someway, heh. That makes me mad because while i was taking a piss test for Office Depot i could have been getting on at Market Street. First off right now, no one is hiring, its just that type of year, But Office Depot sent me to take a pee test, you think that they were gonna put me on, but they are disorganized (and they have all organizers they need, ha) and cant seem to get things done. So that makes me mad, that they are wasting my time!  Jason is doing the same like always, Thomas sold a painting and thats awesome as hell, Ed has not written and not blogged, Chris has been vacant and not contacted, Chris H. is in need of a write, Ken has been busy and not calling like he used too, Blake hopes that things are turning around for him, Robert, yeah, what happened to Robert? Josh i hope that you are well, Jeremy finally got a date, yeah, and micheal, i know you dig me, Amy is doing good and thinking of marriage? Eric is getting a tad testier these days, and stacey is the same as always, Vince is coming around and getting better, joan i could kick your ass right along with nancy, what i wouldnt give to meet your asses in a dark alley, Char is better than before, Shannon, he has gotten less likley to get on my nerves.  MY BIRTHDAY IS ON FEB. 18th! I will be 24 and sosooooooooooooo not looking forward to it, eh, im getting old and my body sucks. Valentines day is coming up and that can be depressing, eh i need FLOWERS AND CANDY AND MUSIC. ah, what i would give to have people care, just not fair. Im outta here  Mika says hi, and she loves you guys

      Today is one of those days that feels like at least Thursday but its only Tuesday, yeah you know those kinda days. Last night i got Eds package, how awesome was that package, oh yeah. THANKS ED! The rolled ciggs smell and taste so good! You will have to write me back and explain everything that you included. BTW-the art was way cool. Thank you for sharing with me. Thomas has sent me some funny e mails today and that was relaxing. Today is a body is down on its luck day. Woke up with a headache, toothache, sinus problems,and female probs. Oh yeah i knew i was in for a good day. Then about lunch i thought i was gonna die, i couldnt stay home from work because i am too damn dedicated. Took some pills at lunch and started to feel a little better. But here it is 3:13 im at work and i feel like i will ralph at any second, im thinking that those pills may not be working good together or something. geez, need a warm blanki and some rest. Im am thinking my lucky stars that i dont have to work my second job today. But rest assured that i have to work weds, thurs,fri,sat, and sunday, of this week. Yeah im working valentines day, and my birthday is coming up on the 18th! i WONDER if anyone remembers, her not say anything about it and we shall see. Mika will remember and i guess thats good enough for me~ 24 years old is what i be...  I watched the dog show last night and was impressed by the dogs and all the while thinking that my dog is cuter than alot of them, but maybe that is because she is mine. But others say that she is the cutest, who knows that mystery may never be solved. Of course anyone telling me that my dog is ugly and i can see that they mean it might get a good ole fashioned ass beatin. "daddys and mommies little girl"  I will be applying for another job here, more money and that is what i need. Its in the same department, actually i am doing this persons work plus mine for the last 2 months or so. So i hope that when they advertise it, and i apply, that i have a good chance. Bring on the money for my own little car!   Chris (Texarkana) where did you go? I have heard nothing from you and im starting to get worried. Have no fear, the shelle is here.  Last night i wanted some ass so bad, i thought that i was going to die. But then i just ate some choc. cake and everything was cool. eesh, did i really just repeat that from my head to the fingers to the keys? Tisk Tisk

      I know i know, i have been a bad girl as far as not writing. For those of you who do not know, i have a second job and i have been working there for a week now. I work at petco, and i love it because i get to take care of the animals and help people with pet problems. Its hard work when it comes to sweeping and mopping the whole store,stocking as well. Huge pallets of pounds and pounds of dog food, whew. The good thing is is that i give it my all and never complain. So that is why i have been away from the computer, have not even logged on for about 3 days and that is way too long for the shelle.  Thomas surprised me at work on Friday and thats supa awesome, he brought me a coffee and i needed that. Thank you Thomas!  CHRIS HAW, my sweetness finally wrote me. Good boy! I miss this guy like no one knows, but he is in Hawaii and so far from me. I grew up with this guy and he was my best friend if anyone is wondering, i miss him with all my heart. I hope to see him soon.

      My birthday turned out to be something that i didnt see coming. When i got home Jason had happy birthday banners up a balloon. There was wonder-fully purple flowers that filled the room with the sweet aroma. There were two cards one said "mama" and the other said "shelle". I opened  the one that said Mama, and it was from Mika and if  you know Mika you know that she loves to eat. So her card was about eating pie! And on the inside there was a picture with Mika in a birthday hat licking her lips. It was the cutest picture! Then there was a big purple package sitting close by. I went ahead and opened it and right on top was another picture of Jason and Mika in her Birthday hat, it was the cutest! Turned out that he got me my Klipsch speakers!!! I was so excited and cant wait to hook them up! Then after that, jason baked me a cake and made me purple frosting for the cake, it was so sososssssooo yummy. HE actually put the candles in the shape of a twenty-four and let me blow them out! (first try if i might ad, i guess im full of hot air, lol) Then he handed me a peice of paper, it was a recipt from my dentist, he paid by 112. dollar balance for me. wow. He told me to close my eyes and led me to the back porch, he said that  this was from someone else. I opened my eyes and there was my picture that Thomas PRomised me that he would have to me on my birthday. and sure enough he did. It was awesome and huge! I guess i didnt think that it would be that big and now i have to try and find a place for it! It had all kinds of purple shades and was just damn cool.  After that Jason and i headed off to the Olive Garden where i was meeting up with mom, sis,BJ, and lizzy. We ate and told perverted three nipples jokes and had a great time. I opened my gifts there and had some coffee after wards. Went to Blockbuster and rented a comedy and a movie. Read a tad, waited till my birthday was over and then i closed my eyes, knowing that my day was over.  Got up today and have to work of course, i also have to work tonight and then next three nights, eesh. Hang in there i say!

       TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY   I am the old age of 24! My family has called and wished me good thoughts on my birthday. One person at work in my section rememberd that it was my birthday, and the other 3 or more didnt. And this is after i got them gifts for Valentines day and one of their birthday. This goes to show me what others would say to me is right. Its not the i want anything in return or expect rather, but they make a way more money than i and cant even try like i do. NOT NEXT YEAR, i am telling you, i will not throw myself out there for them and then live with the fact that im broke! Nope, another birthday and im a year smarter, try and catch me now! Other people in the building are coming up to me and wishing me happy b-day and sending me cards. Even a lady that no longer works here sent me a B-day card, and the people that work inches from me, dont remember. Just hacks me and makes me sad all the while.  More on the birthday later

      It has been so long since i have blogged that its hard for me to even start. I have been working so much that i have fallen out of the loop with my friends and my life that was pryor to the last month and a half. I feel like i am missing out on so many things because i am never in one spot at any lengh of time. I have been working at petco 6 days a week plus my full time day job. Thats 2 full time jobs that i am working and the second job has manager issues. The managers are lacking social skills like no tomorrow, they are the kind of people that make the employees feel like they are worth little more than just help. And its not just me, they had another manager that tried to put in her two week notice, they lost the whole grooming department and several floor workers. I have tried to stick it out and deal with the bullshit. I need the money and i love to work with the animals and that is what has kept me around. I love helping people with their problems and making sure that the store looks good. I have had other managers beg me not to quit along with co-workers that say if i go, they go. Ha....  I have bought a car, yes, i am still in shock. I decided to go ahead and not get the Honda right now. I thought that i would purchase this car and build some credit before i try and get what i really want. I purchased a 2001 Mits. Galant. Its very nice, leather interior,cd,air,power windows, keyless remote. Oh yeah, its the youngest car i have old, the only car i have old with air conditioning. Its a very big thing for me. I have not had my own car in over three years and this is over due. I love it. But of course now i have to think about car insurance, and my car payment, gas.eesh.   I got a promotion at work, that i have worked my ass of for. Stuff is finally coming together in my life and i cant even fathom how long i have waited.  My next door neighbor has a bitch for a girlfriend and he is just plain trash. They always peel out when they leave and have left the other side of my damn driveway a mudpitt. They have torn up my plants, flowers and its awful how it looks. They leav shit in my yard and i hated it. Never said shit to them, just bite my tongue to save jason embaressment, lol. his stupid ass ugly girlfriend was spinning out in the yard tearing shit up, and jason went out there to help her. the next night we are sitting in our living room and there was a loud knock on the door. When i opened the door he was pissed and shaking. He said "can i talk to jason" and i said "you can talk to us". We stepped out on the porch and he looked at jason and said that his girlfriend told him that jason jumped on her and had attitude with her.If you know jason you know that he is not mean, speacially not to women. I jumped in and got in his face. I told him that his girlfriend was a lier and she needed to stop it. I told him that i understand that he was  going to believe her over us, but i can promise him that he needs to rethink himself. Told him that he did NOT need to come over to my house with attitude, because he will walk away with more than he bargained for. Went off on his ass about what they have been doing and he was shaking and makinga fist at times. I stopped and asked him "why are you shaking, why are you mad, quit doing that shit with your fingers". Told him that he had no damn respect for my shit, and that he needs to get his shit together. I was just so pissed that he could come up on us about this tiny little shit, when my anger for him had been growing for months. I was so in his face that im sure he was shocked, and had no idea that i could be that way. I was hopind that he would hit me, because i was gonna whale on his ass. then i finally said "look, this is getting us no where, let me assure that that your girl lied and that we can work this out". I dont want to live next to some one that i hate. Worked some things out and he left happy. BUT his girl, i wanna kick her ass so bad, all her dirty looks, but never never trying to look me in the eye. BITCH.  I need to each lunch and get back to work, eesh. there is some of what is going on for now....

      I have been dragging today, no energy. Working all day here at the state parks, and then working tonight at Petco. I am actually trying to tie the two together. We started our annual "Spring a Pet" Petco foundation, i have raised over 200 bucks in donations so far. We are planning of having a day playing music and cooking out at the store, to raise more donations for the cause. I thought that i would try and use my resources from my first job to help the second, so i am proposing a plan to have a interpreter from one of our state parks to come and give a program through out the day. They can teach the diffrence between "wild animals" and actual Pets. Trying to get our KAB department to try and help out as well, with working with pets and the enviroment. I had a semi-meeting with the director of state parks about my plan and he seems to be going for it. I brought him some information on the Petco foundation today and we shall see what goes down from there.  I am still loving my car and here really soon my first car payment wiill start, eee gads. Insurance i am already paying and my other bills as well. Mika loves me working at petco because i constantly bring her treats home from the Pet Buffet Bar, yup she is spoiled.   The weather is starting to turn into spring and getting a little warmer. I went and bought some elephant ears and some Hosta to go out in the flower bed. They should do rather well this year and i am curious to see. Thomas is thinking of coming down this way sometime soon,and robert sent me a badass birthday. Chris Haw sends me more e mails recently, and Jason is sweet. Last night i was outside on the porch when the lightning, thunder rolled in with rain soon to follow. Yeah it was real nice, we opened the windows and let the sweet wet air come right on in. Very nice and i cant help but think of the feeling all day today while i have been stuck at work.

      If they days were any prettier i would have to take a step back. When spring hits its almost like you find out why you keep on going. The trees with buds, the plants full of green sprouts. Little Mika playing in the yard, and rolling in the grass with the tongue hanging out the side. Little moments like that just make me want to smile the best smile and laugh out loud. Spent some time with Thomas and Jason at the Barnes and a tad at the shoe store. Thomas is doing well and his paintings are awesome. Jason is traveling more to the parks and having a tad better of a time going in and out without so many computer problems. Chris H. is doing good i think, he is still in hawaii and i miss the guy. Just from e mails i can tell that he has changed a tad, but i will always do anything for him. Chris in Texarkana is doing well , he got into the art school that he wanted and his life is starting to perk up and he needs it for sure. Jeremy is telling me im sexy every 5 min, its cute, but he has to know that its not gonna go anywhere. Michael has been in hiding and re-appearing this week. Michael (hot springs) IS STILL calling the job and wanting to be my boyfriend. Eric finally found a truck and bought it. Ken is wanting to hang out and i cant seem to get the nerve. James wants it i know he does, he has 4 kids at 29, whoa.   My other job wants me to be a manager, but i cant because i am only part time. They said that maybe i can be a team leader and open and close  the store and do all the money at night. I hope so because that is 9 bucks an hour for a second job, not bad. Got my income tax in and not a moment too late, my first car payment is April 2nd. eesh, here that goes.   The yard is coming along and the hosta is in bloom. Im happy, when the weather is like this, im happy to roll down the windows when i drive and turn the music up and just chill.

      So Sunday was a wonderful day, the best day in a long time. Sunday Jason and i got up and started  to run to plant shops and home depot for goodies for the yard. We had so much fun and it was a wondeful day outside, lower 70s with the sun as bright as it could be. We planted and listened to music, it was great. we bought 2 shepard hooks and here are some of the plants we bought.    Jasmine-   Common white jasmine or poets jasmine (Jasminum officinale) is hardy throughout the Midlands but questionable in the Upstate.   Mature Height/Spread: Common jasmine grows to a height of 10 to 15 feet as a lanky, semi-vining shrub. When grown as a vine, its arching branches have to be supported on an arbor or trellis. To grow it as a shrub requires frequent pruning. The very fragrant, white flowers are up to 1 inch in diameter and they are present all summer and into fall. The rich green leaves have five to nine leaflets, each up to 2 inches long.  Growth Rate: Common jasmine is moderately fast-growing. It grows 12 to 24 inches a year.  Landscape Use: Plant jasmine near the house or near a walk so its intense fragrance can be enjoyed and so you can watch hummingbirds and butterflies come to the flowers.  Cultivation: All jasmines prefer full sun to partial shade and a warm site. They grow well in regular garden soil with moderate levels of soil fertility and moisture, and they need frequent pinching and shaping to control growth. Low-growing, shrubby kinds make good hedges. Jasmines bush out and should not be jammed together. Set them at least 8 feet apart in shrub borders. Containerized plants are best planted in the fall.  Problems: Common jasmine is relatively problem-free.    Carolina Jessamine-   Carolina jessamine is one of the most beautiful vines of the South. It covers fences and trees in open woodlands and along roadsides throughout the Southeast with its slender vines and bright yellow flowers. It is the state flower of South Carolina.  MATURE HEIGHT/SPREAD  Carolina jessamine grows to 20 feet or more when grown as a vine. It can also be grown as a ground cover, maintained with a yearly cutting in late spring after flowering to 3 feet or less.   GROWTH RATE  This vines growth rate is moderate, growing rapidly once established or with rich soil and adequate water.   ORNAMENTAL FEATURES Sweetly scented, golden yellow flowers cover the cascading, fine textured foliage from February to April. The trumpet-shaped blooms are 1 to 1 inches long and are attractive to butterflies. The shiny evergreen leaves are 1 to 3 inches long on 10-to-20-foot tall vines. In colder areas of the state, it may be semi-evergreen and the leaves may turn bronze in winter.  LANDSCAPE USE  Carolina jessamine is easy to grow. It is attractive on an arbor where the slender branches hung with yellow flowers can be seen from below. This plant will stay in scale and can be used on decks and porches and near patios and entryways. It is good in containers and as a ground cover along steep banks to help control erosion.   Carolina jessamine tolerates either full sun or partial shade. Flowering is more prolific and foliage growth is denser in full sun.   This vine is very adaptable and will grow in a variety of conditions. For best results, plant it in rich, well-drained soil. Moist soil is ideal, but the vine is able to withstand periods of drought once established.   Plant from containers during cool weather, spacing 3 feet apart for ground cover and 4 to 8 feet apart for wall or trellis climber.  Fertilize while the plant is actively growing with moderate amounts of a balanced fertilizer. Do not overfeed, since excessive fertilizer can reduce flowering.   Older vines that become top-heavy or sparse can be pruned back to a few feet above ground level after flowering. Remove dead or broken branches and shape the plant each year after bloom. Mow groundcovers every few years to maintain density.  PROBLEMS All parts of this plant are poisonous. The sap may cause skin irritation in sensitive individuals. Children can be poisoned by sucking the nectar from the flowers. Insects or diseases rarely trouble Carolina Jessamine. Deer will not eat it.     Hosta-   Hostas are easy-to-grow, shade-tolerant perennials grown mainly for their beautiful foliage.   HEIGHT/SPREAD The size of hostas varies greatly. The largest measures 4 feet in height with 20-inch-long leaves. The smallest collectors miniatures may be only a few inches across. Most hostas range between 1 and 2 feet tall. Growing conditions influence size.   GROWTH RATE Hostas are very long-lived. Hostas may outlive their gardeners if given a good planting location and reasonable care.  ORNAMENTAL FEATURES Hosta leaves come in many shapes, colors, sizes and textures. The leaves grow as clumplike mounds in colors ranging from yellow-green to dark green to blue-green. Variegated forms are common.   Hosta leaves may be rounded to oval, heart-shaped or strap-like. The leaf may be flat, have a wavy edge or have an interesting puckered texture.   Hostas are also grown for their flowers, which are produced from early summer to fall depending on the species and cultivar. Flowers may be white, lavender or purple. Some hostas are fragrant.  PROBLEMS Garden slugs are the most common problem of hostas. The most popular remedy is saucers of beer, which attract slugs, and then they drown. Use caution if you use slug baits since they can also poison pets. Space plants further apart.   Hostas will change color or fade if they are in too much sun. Most blue hostas need shade. In full sun, leaf color is pale and leaf dieback may occur, especially during dry periods. Yellow and cream edges may brown during dry periods. Blue-leafed cultivars sometimes fade to green if the waxy leaf covering that gives them their color is rubbed off by strong rain storms or vigorous watering.  Voles and deer can be a problem if wildlife is active in your area.  Foliar nematodes can also be a problem. Buy new plants in late summer or fall so you can check for infestation. Do not purchase plants that show browning in between leaf veins.   Hosta anthracnose can cause large whitish spots with brown edges to form on leaves and stalks. Remove the damaged leaves.   LANDSCAPE USE Hostas prefer areas that are partly shaded or shaded. Some cultivars are sun-tolerant, but all do best if they receive shade in the afternoon.   Hostas prefer well-drained soil with plenty of organic matter. Hostas need plenty of moisture during the growing season to support the growth of their large, soft leaves. They will need an inch or more of water per week if not supplied by rains. If the weather is very hot or the plants are in sun or subject to root competition from trees and shrubs, they will need more water.   In early spring after the first growth starts, apply a well-balanced, slow-release fertilizer. Avoid excessive fertilizer rates.   Plant, transplant and divide hostas either in the early fall or in spring before leaves unfold. While hostas can be successfully divided at any time that they can be dug, they will need much more care if divided during summer heat. Divide hostas by either cutting away a section of a clump with its roots or by lifting the clump and separating it. Be sure to use clean, sharp tools. Replant the new plants promptly and water well. Space plants 1 to 3 feet apart, allowing room for growth. Hostas do best when left undisturbed for several years.   Remove flower stalks after bloom to encourage vigorous growth, rather than seed production. Remove hosta leaves and clean up around the plants after they have died back in the fall to help control diseases  and slugs.   SPECIES AND CULTIVARS There are more than 2,000 registered cultivars of hosta grown today. The species and cultivars mentioned below are just a few of those that are well-suited to growing throughout South Carolina.     Viburnum-   This is a very fragrant bush, that produces white flowers and grows  high.    Monday morning i was awoken by a Little Rock Police Officer at my door. He said "mam, is this your car?" I said yes! Walked out and my trunk was popped and my door was wide open into the street. Yup it had been broken into, and jasons as well! But to learn they hit out neighbor and about 5 more up the road. FUCKING BASTARDS. I hate hate hate people that steal from people that work there ass off for what they have. I work two damn jobs to keep what i have. Im trying to get over this one...

      Well Well Well to no surprise they called me in last night on my day off, I had the feeling but tried  to ignore it. Michael  from Alaska has started to talk to me again, I used to chat with him on occasion, but he has been so busy with his job and now he is the director there. Way to go Michael! The pictures that he sent to me are so wonderful, like the kind that you would see in a National geographic Mag. Supa sweet and Supa Cold! Jason has been out of the office today roaming with Eric fixing computers, and having the best time im sure, ha. Problems have arrived with the raise that I was getting at work, but really in the long run it will be better.  I have to work again tonight, oh yeah for shelle. Hopefully it will be a good night, but somehow I doubt that. I can feel a nagging manager coming on. There was a lady coming there today to check on the animals. She was trying to be sneaky and come a day earlier. I hope that went smooth, I doubt it, seeing how she is the royal pain in the arse. So I am preparing myself for the roll out of do this, do that type thing.   behind prepared and letting things roll of the back.   Thomas and I talked  a tad on the phone today, it was nice. We are so crazy, I was answering this e mail that he sent me that had like 70 questions. We laughed and talked about some of our answers.  So the news is final today that my boss is going to retire, because of his cancer. Im worried about he will be in his position, please no one with a power trip, I beg of you. I have gathered some of his photos to put in a presentation coming soon and its almost heartbreaking.  Wish me luck on the second job!

      Getting better at posting latley, dont get your hopes up on this all the time. I have caught myself up at work (parks and tourism) and i have semi-free-time on occasion that i am able to do things like this. I have the night off from Petco tonight and today i have been getting some more of the details together for this Saturday. Looks like David is back in town and chewing everyone in the store a new asshole. He is such a prick. Kamby does not like him and he is the newest to the league of drowning pet idiots, so we are called. I am trying to move up there but seems like i am always faced with some kind of challenge or two. Its ok tho, that is what life is all about right? yeah her thought so.   The day is chilly and heavy dark clouds have rolled in and latched themselves on to the trees that are bent over from the wind. Its not the normal wonderful days that we have been having for the past week or two. Maybe i can clean the room tonight, but maybe i wont and just do what i do best, run my mouth and lay around.   Was able to talk to Thomas online today for a bit, glad to know that he is doing well.   Eh, petco's managers suck ass and thats just that. Makes the working experience a tad rougher and i want to call in sick a daily basis. *shelle looks around for prozac*  gotta run almost time to go and, and , and, and, and, im gonna go.  *Mika raises paw and says bye*

      Things are finally coming together for me. I have saved up some annual leave at work, and my bank roll is more than i have ever had. I have a car that is nice and is doing well. And the days are getting nicer with breezes that are wonderful. I have gardened in the yard and still have my other job. They have started to put some more responsibilities on me at Petco and i trained a new girl yesterday. I work tonight and most of this week, but kinda dont mind, because i am getting more money. As much as i have come to not liking a second job, it might be hard to quit because i am used  to  the extra money, ya think?   Still have not talked to my mom again since she was semi-bitter for some reason about my new car. I need to go see my daddy and show him my new ride. I have just got caught up at work and my boss is in budget meetings all week. Im sure it will be back to the grind stone when she is back out. Wondering how my sister is doing and wanting to see her little girl, but dont have any time. I went to see two rad movies this weekend, Dreamers, and Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.  Check them out here:  urlLink Market Street   Eternal sunshine was an awesome movie and i saw alot of myself in it. Kate winslett was awesome and i loved her in it. They have made some more improvments at market street, they have put better chairs in, and extended the wall to the left as you walk in. Looks like things are starting to look up for them as well. I hope so. I have started to see more of the yuppy young groupies there, eh, something i knew that was bound to happen. Lets hope that they keep it down to the minimum. Or nothing like the immature college kids who think they own the world, or invented most of it. Me, im just me, and love forign films. (ahem) and i love legal porn. heh.  I am thinking that i want a palm pilot, and an ipod. Yeah i want the stuff that i cant let money get spent on. Would really like a wireless laptop, but i know that its not because i need it, its only because i want it. With the little wireless cute mouse. Maybe i can get the fold up keyboard with my Palm. Ipod would be good for when i go walking, ok, so i dont walk that much anymore, but its a badass toy, gotta give it props.   Have been meaning to clean the bedroom for awhile now. Jason has set up a wireless connection in the house, so my computer needs to be moved cause its just to flaky with the connection where it is at. So that calls for the rearranging of the bedroom, good god this could take a weekend, ha. I get so pissed off about my connection not working right like it did with the cable. But the cable eventually started to not work so this was next. Poor jason has to deal with the bitching of the shelle about the connection, he deals with it and is getting better about what to say to shut me the hell up. ha.   Last night J and i hit up the local barnes and nobles, nothing like a coffee and a conversation. Before we went in we were sitting in the car having some dinner, and this girl gets into the car next to us and does not relize that we were in the car because my windows are dark tinted. She gets in and lets her car door open right on to mine, and she looks over. I just stuck out my hand and pointed at her. Jason rolls down the window as she was starting to back up and she kills the car in fright. She starts the car again and took off. It was funny to scare her, but i was mad that people are not more careful these days. I always hold the door as i am getting in if i am close to another car. Jasons honda has so many little marks on it where people have done that. Just lack of respect, and i know that she will think twice about it where ever she parks again.   Still loving Sarah and Beth to the fullest, and mika is full of love.   Thomas how are you? Chris i miss ya, and we all need to hang in there!!!!  Kisses and love bye-bye

      After reading the blog of Thomas I am so jealous of his past week. Thomas went to New Orleans and had a blast. Drinking, Art, Drawing and Friends, Yeah that's a good time. He wrote about his adventures and lusts and loves. Thomas needed this break, im so siked that he was able to hit the road. I miss the road trips something awful and its prime time to do it. I was wanting to go see my pops this weekend, but I am afraid its going to be nasty and rainy, so I might pass and say I am available for my second job. Was thinking about the things that I am grateful for and decided to jot some things down. I am grateful for:  Good educated friends Past relationships (you learn something from everyone of them) Good eclectic music My two dogs Mika and Isobel My two jobs (we have to make a living somehow) Sunny days with nice wind, and rainy days to sleep with My health (even tho I don't take care of myself to the best extent) Independent Films  People who say what you always wanted to say  For those who don't tune in on a daily basis, you might have missed the stations where I grab my groove!    urlLink Radio Paradise  I stream RP all day long every day, love the music and the vibe it gives off You should hop into the forums as well, good people, good conversations    urlLink Soma  Awesome sounds to fall asleep too, and to groove with in the wee late hours Salad and Beat Blender are good ones, but you should explore all!    urlLink KCRW  An awesome educational station, for those who want anything and everything They actually had Beth Orton in an interview once, so yeah, there awesome!  Sitting here on this Friday and im siked, its not that much longer till I call it a day, until 6 anyways. It is supposed to rain tomorrow and it looks like I might not go see pop.  Blake how are you? Thomas im so over jealous! Chris H. How is Hawaii right now? Chris (ark) how is school coming? Robert I LOVED MY BIRTHDAY CARD, are you still drawing? Jason take it one step at a time. Ken, I know time is getting old, how is Ginger? Eric, congrats on your new ride, sorry bout the stiff car bills. Darryl,  you crack me up and your so laid back for the lifestyle you have. Ed, damn im sorry I have not contacted. Kevin I think about you sometimes.  Have you ever thought that you have so much passion for things in life, and your words don't seem to match? The sun is such a wonderful medication, and life really is too short. I want to walk the cobble streets in a villa some where outside of time and laugh, smile and take deep breaths. Would love to sit on the corner of a coffee shop have damn good conversation and Java. (perhaps some cheesecake too) Would like to be in a Amazon like Forrest and have wild sex, anyone with me on that one?   One of the best feelings to me is to be out in the sun all day long having fun in the water, and then taking a shower and getting all fresh again. Then going out for awhile and getting some good food. You know the feeling when you swim all day and your starving!oh yeah, swimming and eating grapes in awesome too. BAD PART: getting out of the pool and having  to go in a air conditioned house, damn thats cold! Just the feeling of being worn out and relaxing is quite nice.

      I thought that i was gonna throw Izzy across the room last night, eesh. When i got Izzy i knew that it was alot of responsibility and i had already gone thru that with Mika. When i was on my way to work last night i knew that Izzy was going to be very hyper because she was in a crate while i was at work, so i prepared for that. When i got home Izzy had pulled the treat bag thru the cage and there were treats all over the place for her and Mika to eat. I didnt get on them because that was my fault that i didnt put the bag up higher. Izzy went potty outside like a good girl and wanted to play when we got inside. I was so tired but knew that i needed to play with her because she deserved that. She wanted to go ahead and pee in the house, and i had to take her oustside to show her that she needed to go outside. I was hungry so i went and made me a bowl of cerial. I sat down on the couch and Izzy was running around with a sock of mine. I had to put my cerial on the coffee table and get  the sock from her. As i got the sock, she darted towards my cerial, head first she went. I got her away and this was five min. of me dragging her away from my cerial bowl and mika wanting some food and me trying to get the cerial bowl. I put her in her cage for 5 min. and then let her back out again. She persisted to chew on things other than her toys thru-out the evening. I was up and down off the couch for most of the night. I had had it and the only way i was going to get rest was to go to bed. I put izzy in her cage and went to bed. Izzy didnt want to be in her cage and whined. I put a pillow over  the my head and went to sleep.   About 6 this morning i opened a eye to the sound of Izzy whining. I thought i had been asleep for 5 min. and i was awoke by her again. I got up and opened the cage for her and Mika to go outside. Izzy took off toward the bedroom and did a runny number two all over a sweater and the floor. Handling one puppy in one arm and trying to get mika to go oustide, while having the soiled clothes in the other hand. I threw the clothes in the washing machine and started it. I took Izzy outside for her to go potty and all she wanted to do was play. We came back inside and i needed to take a bath. I locked Izzy in the bathroom with me and she whined because she could not get into the bath tub. While i was shaving my legs she wanted to chase the razor and chew on it. Finally half way dressed and ready to go to work. Put izzy back in her cage and took off. While i was on my way to work, i was thinking whoa im going to work to get away from it! ha  I knew and prepared myself for the puppy stage before i got her. Puppys can just work the nerve! I love her tho and she is a wonderful baby girl! Had a talk with Mika last night about how much i appreciated her, but knew that I trained her to be how she is. And thats the goal with little Izz-bot.

      Over the weekend i had another addition to my family. Her name is Isobel. I got her on Saturday night about 8 o'clock when i went back to look at her for the second time. She is a 7 week old Pomeranian. She is registered with papers just like Mika. Not that having papers really matters because i am not a breeder and dont plan on having them bred. Just to show that they have a good bloodline. She is wonderful and Mika has taken to her very well. They play together and Mika acts like she is her baby, she protects her. So, right now we are going thru the potty training and chewing stages, i did that 4 and a half years ago with Mika. I crate trained Mika and i shall do the same with izzy (isobel). Things that she loves to chew on the most:  The oriental Rugs Socks Curtains Shoes and any paper that she can find  The other day upon coming to work i put new newspaper in her crate. When i came home for lunch to let her out, there was no newspaper and there was none around the area. ummm, did she eat it? What a little terd! Jason pratically refuses to clean up any accidents she might make in the house, so its all up to momma. It was fun shopping for some chew toys, collar, and some treats. Her little face, i sware, she is the cutest thing ever. I try to pay extra close attention to Mika because i dare not want her to feel like she is being left out in any way. After all, she will always be my favorite!  I got a postcard from Thomas while he was in New Orleans, THANKS! It was such a pretty card and i loved it. Nice to know that you are thought of.... Today Jason left to go to some parks and i had to drive his car home from work. The breaks are weird. Its like ever so often when you are stopped they will ease the way to the floor. My first thought is a hole in the break line, but there has never been any leaking anywhere. So i took it to a firestone place today and dropped it off. They called me and said they could not find a thing wrong with it. So that means i will have to take it to the Honda dealership, and thats a arm and a leg. Im thinking that its the drum that is by passing and therefore not leaking out on the ground. Maybe its leaking inside the drum, eesh. I called the Honda place and asked them the amount on the part and labor....here it is...a whopping 285.00. DAMN. Honda's are good cars, but very expensive to fix. Jason does not know that i took it, heh, was hoping  to have it fixed before he comes back. Looks like that wont happen. oh well.  I have to work tonight and i hope that goes smooth. My dad is moving to a new house, he is getting off the mountain. I need  to go there with weekend and see where he is moving too. He has not seen my new car,Isobel, or me in awhile. Plus he has a new Pom puppy that i have not seen. His puppy is just like Mika, black and a tad bit grey. He has a boy and i have two little girls.   Pictures of Mika and Izzy are coming soon!  Well i have rattled on long enough, later guys!

      I just finished watching "My life without me", whoa, you want to talk about a powerful movie. Full of emotion, heartbreak,games and pure life.    urlLink My life without me   Watching this movie I have looked back on life with a new lease on ideas. But the sad part about it is im not sure how long this feeling will last. Have you ever watched a movie that made you cry, and want to change your life. You have such passion about it at this time between the ride home and when you wake up, but soon after you slip right back into your normal living slot. I have seen and heard about the death that surrounds the dreaded word cancer. My boss has been forced into retirement and now cant seem to remember his name on occasion from all the morphine. Two aunts of mine and my grandma died from cancer. (breast cancer and lung cancer) I watched them die for hours and days, its horrible, it allows you to suffer and think about if you brought it on yourself. And here I sit and smoke a pack a day, what is wrong with me. I don't want to quit that's the problem, I like them. And for that reason I am scared that quitting will not work for me. damn. I will quit and soon, I have to at least try, right? I am so worried that I can quit now and my lungs look like new, then when I am 35 the doctor says I have cancer from years early. Is there any escape? people that don't smoke, get cancer. We are looked down upon in public, you may not notice because you do not pay attention. The way people go out of there way to get around you and your habit if you are lit up. The "no smoking" signs seem to push you more and more away from the buildings. The "WE ID" signs screaming at  you in the grocery and convient stores. We are "litter bugs" because of our butts. The no smoking in bars anymore. WHAT? I say have smoking and non smoking bars, its your choice what bar you go too right? Why don't they just make them illegal, ill tell you why, because more people would be in jail, and you know how bad they are already crowded. You know a cigg is worth way more than an ass whooping in jail too! Back in the 20s it was sexy to smoke. Yeah sure we may not have known JUST how bad they were, but they knew it was not a bowl of fruit either. eh. Who am I kidding, I just need to quit because I don't want to be without the people that I love and to not be able to live life. I don't want a time limit on life.....  Mom wants me to come over this weekend for a party that she is having at her house. I don't want to break it to her that I might go see daddy. I really need to! Thomas is coming in town this weekend to watch Kill Bill II, and I will not be here. Sorry Thomas, IM sure you will enjoy the movie all the while. Blake, my dear Blake I am sorry that I have been so busy, but I know you understand.    List of things to do:   Need to check oil in car Pluck eyebrows paint toenails and fingernails burn some cds work on Isobel's potty training harder read a good book like "Tuesdays with morrie" clean room some more read more cultural literacy wash hair get some rest blow everyone kisses

      Nothing way out exciting to post here today, just me living the life. I have had some days off, not as much as i needed, but some is better than none. I have been playing with Izzy and Mika and loving the fact that its getting warmer. I need to clean my room like mad and i have been putting it off for weeks. Tell me that is not bad! ha. I think im going to see papa this weekend, double excited about that. Wondering how well Izzy is going to do. This will be her first long trip, eesh, it could be rough.  Right now i am listening to Jeff Buckley waiting on the time to pass. I have been up to my ears in paperwork today and the day has been so busy, but the time has stopped totally. Had some attitude from the co-workers nothing new. Last night Jason and i went Easter Candy shopping. You know that the day after the candy is like 50% off! Our coffee table is covered with candy, its pathetic i know. It was like we went out and mugged a couple of kids on halloween,awesome. For those of you who still want some candy, get out there and get your candy at a discount!!! heh

      Today has been quite an eye opener. Eric, Jason and I went to eat lunch today. We stopped by the house and I let Isobel and Mika out to potty while the guys went to the bank. Isobel and Mika were good girls. The guys came to pick me back up and we went to the mall to grab some grub. On the way back to lunch across from the blind school on the curve of Markham there was an accident. It was very recent because the smoke was coming from the cars and no one was there. The two people were still in there vehicles. I told Jason to pull over because I had to help them. I ran up to the guy and asked him if he was ok, he had a big gash in his head and was bleeding. I told him to stay there while I went to check on the other person. I walk up to the maroon honda accord and look inside. It was a lady that works in our history commission. She looked up at me and said my name, I told her to relax and don't move. I asked her where she was hurting and she said her chest and foot. I  told her that her chest prob hurts because of the seat belt and the air bags. I didn't want to tell her that she might have broken her foot or ankle. I asked her what I needed to get so when the ambulance gets here she will have her stuff. She asked for her keys and I had to juggle it out of the ignition because it was smashed. I got her purse and shoes, and the cell phone out of the glove box. When they ambulance got there they could not get her doors open with the crowbar and had  to get her out thru the back. Sucks too, her car was paid off and she wont get what the car is worth I know it. The other guy admitted that it was his fault. She was on her way back to work from lunch and he pulled out in front of her. Both cars were totaled. He was asking where his glasses were and I found them, they were on the other side of her car. He asked where I found them, when I told him he told me that he was wearing them at impact. The accident bent his frame and his car is no more either. Today was a very hectic day to say the least. Its one thing to get out and your heart is pounding as you approach the cars knowing they are strangers, and then seeing someone you know in the drivers seat, whew. I just got the hair out of her face and touched her cheek. Held on to her shoulder and tried to keep her talking. All you can do is tell her its gonna be ok, in this case it was. The song that popped in my head was "fast car" by Tracy Chapman. Everyone Drive safe and I love ya!  I went to my sisters daughters third birthday party on Sat. Mom called and wanted me  to be there by 1 so we could get the balloons blew up and what not. I showed up and carried her Easter basket in that I made for her. About 1:30 Petco calls asking me to come in that day and Easter Sunday, I just said yes. I left her birthday party and never got to see her open presents. Damn. I have to work tonight as well, yeah for shelle.

I have already got the cravings, so i went to the store and bought some fruit and veggies. I must rememeber to not eat bad food while i go thru this. I have seen people smoking since i have quit today and its so tempting. I hope that i can actually get thru this ok. I wanna kick the girls ass that gave me my first cigg, but i know that it was my choice as well.

      It truly has been awhile, since i have hopped on the machine and said a little of this and that. Last week Sabina was broke into again and they took all the speakers and amp. fucking lowlife bastards, and this was while at work, sigh. Went to Auto Audio and told them the situation and they said that i was the 6th person to come in there that day with the same problem. Thought about throwing 600 bucks on a alarm system, but for that much i guess i expect it to hold them till i get there? I had to work all weekend again, im tired of it, of having no money, of quiet conversations and no one who understands.  Been feeling  quite alone latley, damn just life. Its raining today and fits the mood, how i would like to have a cigg and watch the rain fall. I wish i had good conversation, coffee and pure love around me. Why cant i have that?  pssssss oh yeah, still no smoking

      Friday for all and all for a Friday..  Here are some currant events for those that know little about happenings:  * Thrid Annual Lower Main Street Music and Arts Fair May 21& 22 (Batesville)  *Fayettville passed the non-smoking in rest Restaurants. Ozark Brewing Company had to close its doors, said the non-smoking ordinance was the last straw.  *Old State House Museum (remembering 9th street Jazz)   The weather has been nice lately, as in Rainy and cloudy with awesome looking cloud forms. The wind has been stronger than normal. The first eye opener in the morning gets harder with days like these. The room is so dim and i am warm under the covers. The dogs are asleep above and below my head. Knowing that i have to get up is a tremendous struggle. When its nice and sunny, for some reason it just seems to be easier to get up and get out.  Have talked little to Eric, and its my fault not his. Jason and i have done our normal arguments, and Ken keeps calling and i dont have the strentgh to call him back.Isobel is corrupting Mika and Mika is heading backwards in her training. Isobel is doing good when it comes to someone eating, she will no longer jump all over you and scratch your legs up. The trip coming up will sure to surprise me, with Isobel and Mika for 8 or more hours. I think that we are going to take Sabina and Not Chloe. I need to keep the miles off her if i can since she is a re-sell car and Sabina will be here till she has nothing left. Plus Sabina has cloth and not leather like Chloe. I sure do have alot of names in my life.

      The weekend went by so fast, wait was there a weekend? My friend Amy came in town from Kentucky and i hardly had any time to spend with her because i was working and that sucks. I am able to spend time with her tonight too, but i am working. Went to actually see Thomas yesterday, yup drove all the way to Arkadelphia. (only an hour)It was a nice change, it was the type of trip that i actually laughed and yelled outloud to myself, i needed it. I just watched the sun beat off the trees and it was wonderful.I had the music up and i was singing louder than i have ever sung in the shower all by my little self. It was good to see Thomas, he gave me this huge but wonderful poster B/W. I was shocked because he had had it for so long and he was giving it to me. That meant something to me, but usually what he does means something anyway.  Chris and i have been talking a little more latley and thats a good thing! He is so creative and very nice to shelle. Eric, wow, Eric thats all im gonna say.   Isobel and Mika have been living it up in the house and i wish i could spend more time with them. Might head off too Iowa for memorial day with Jason, Isobel and Mika.   Painted last night (THANK YOU THOMAS) and it was so relaxing and wonderful! Called Mom on mothers day and talked to her awhile and didnt fight? Need to call my dad and tell him i love him, every day should be dad day for my pop.

      I should not be up this early, 4 something...I should be asleep in my bed, thinking of warm fuzzies. I have been in wrenching pain for about 42 hours now, if not more. It was starting to get warm so I figured ill go and tan some. I never tan that much because I can tan pretty good by myself.Went in to a new place, didn't even an 30 like normal, they put me in for 15. Went and tanned, was good to go until about 9 or 10 that night. I turned red ALL OVER MY BODY and have pain like your would not understand. The next morning I couldn't sleep the bed feels like sandpaper.Got up about 5 am and was just throwing up and nauseated. Clothes hurt like hell and im not going there with a bra. Got up and went to the doctor, and had a steroid shot in my ass yesterday. (feels like a little pinch my ass)They don't tell you about it numbing up and feeling like your cheek will fall off for a sec or so.She told me to bend over and put my hands on the table, hehehe. Also got a prescibed some cream that I picked up at pharmacists yesterday. Here it is another day and I am in the same amount of pain.Cant sleep, shit I got at walgreens helps none, and no aspirin is working. Cant sit,lay,move,touch without cringing, and the worse thing is, I brought it up myself. (Michelle slaps head and repeats the word stupid) So I am here thinking of actually painting a little, Isobel is up with me already tearing stuff up. She loves for me to hold her, but she jumps on my burned skin with her nails, eesh. Need dog repellent.  The dog adoption lady at work has a house for rent and for cheap. Went and wollowed around it yesterday, its awesome as hell, maybe I can see inside if it today. She will have a kennel there and I can take care of the dogs that they place there. That's cool for me because I love it. Who knows, will keep you posted.(bad thing, I have pulled off 3 ticks since yesterday from the land out there, not good on sunburn)Have to go to work today, how in the hell am I doing the bra, there is no damn way. I am red, but not near as red, and in the same pain, there is something wrong here.  Watched Big fish and calendar girls in the last two days....I will marry Ewan McGregor I think, its his voice and smile, lets not forget his singing in Moulan Rouge.Billy Crudup is hot too, as in almost famous.     urlLink Big Fish     urlLink Calender Girls   Eric i called and got no response, thomas have not talked to you! Chris in Hawaii, i got your e mail i need to write you back when i have ample time.Chris in Arkadelphia, i know i know i need to take the time and call you. Ed man its been awhile, i need to talk to you, if i have time i need to send you something.

      Today is better than the days behind me, and for that I am thankful. I awoke to dark grey and stormy skies, making it hard to come up and above the covers.Isobel chewing on my hair, and mika wanting all the attention all too early in the morning, each and every morning. Going to work was a task at hand not including the list of things that I needed to get done before leaving the house. Washing my hair was not an option, maybe I should sinead it.   Eric you should not have, BUT DID! Today at work I had purple roses appear in a huge box.The smell from the roses are almost more than I can bare just sitting in this chair.They are all little buds, so I cant wait to watch them open up. I will post a picture of them soon. Thank you so much Eric, I had no idea.They brightend my day and had everyone in the office asking "who were the flowers from"? I mean I would walk down the halls and people would say "who's the lucky guy"! It was quite crazy! See that should show you right there that im not about every single guy I see! Anyways, have picture, will post.(Thomas, her has not forgot)  Today I had lunch at the casa with Jason and the pups. Isobel thought it would be great to run in the mudd and jump on mammas white shirt. Mika was watching from a distance behind the bushes, she knew what was coming. The funeral for my boss will be this Saturday at 11, I decided to go ahead and take off from Petco, but I will prob go in afterwards because im a sucker. (shush Eric) :>)  My fav. pet in the store has to be this Bird that I named Chloe.She is a Sun Conure. The bird is just badass. She loves me, when I play with her and then put her back in the cage, she yells at me. She loves my shoulder and kisses my cheeks. I would so buy her for my very own, but I have two dogs and she is not cheap 550.00.  Here is a link to what she looks like, this is not her, but it is a Sun Conure. Maybe if we all pitch in I can get her for cheap!!!!She is a handfed bird.::::   urlLink Sun Conure   If you would like to browse around instead...here ya go.   urlLink Petco   Thomas the pictures that you sent me are awesome as hell. They are wonderful and in very nice light even tho they are B/W. You look like a junior Mark Rothko in his last pictures. Not Mark himself, but how they are situated.Pollock if you will....Damn i need to go back to my Modern Art Mus back home.  Listening to Lush (lovelife) Eating Lucas Lemon and dreaming of martinis on the beach

      Dealing with it the day after... My face is swollen and my eyes are heavy. People are walking by with the "I don't really know what to say" look on their face. Truth is, I really would not know what to say myself, just one of those quiet times. I have to move on and just deal with it. Yesterday when I was at the hospital I had a nurse stop because she saw me crying and asked "Is there anything that I can do"? I told her that I was just dealing with it, that I just had to deal with it. She asked "do you need someone to talk too, if so, I am here". I thought that it was an awesome gesture and just wanted to hug her neck. Not often do you just want to hug a strangers neck, but it does happen. I looked up with my dark red watery eyes and gave her a slight smile and politely told her no thank you.   Watched a really awesome movie last night. It was one that i had been wanting to see, but just never got around to it. Then Netflix finally dropped it at my door and i knew that i had  too. Bowling for Columbine, yes i know that i am far behind on that one. Anyways, if there is someone farther behind than me, please rent the movie. I think he has a new one out about Sept 11th and so on.   Talked with Eric via E mail and he has something for tomorrow. I have no idea, but he seems siked about it.Have heard little from Thomas (what pictures)? Ken has not called today, i feel bad for that. Eric W. will be going to the drag strip with Jason, Robert and I in the next couple of weeks. Iowa is coming up quick and im excited to get away for awhile, even if its really a little while.

      RIP-Russell Chris Peek  Today has had a tragic end in some respect. My boss is gone from us. He passed away today about four. I left work to go see him in the hospital and soon after he passed. I have cried till I cant cry anymore, my face is swollen and my stomach is upset. I have so many questions and no answers, answers that will never come.I am going through the anger, the sadness and the blank stare stages that seem to come when its all over. Damn he was smart and so well "Chris". I am glad that he is gone for the fact that he was in so much pain, they had him on so much morphine. Will look for him in the paper tomorrow or the next.   I need to paint, I need to, but cant see past the swelling and water wells.... When i read the post before this, i had no idea that it would be so soon, you just never know.

      Things are hard for me right now, and i hope that the clouds soon part their ways. I am very depressed today, i just got word that my boss is not expected to live more than a week. For some reason i just keep thinking that people will soon pull out of it, and they never seem to.Cancer is so horrible, so horrible. From my family members to the very people that stay close on a daily basis, its all around us. I quit smoking almost four weeks ago and i am so proud of myself. Even though smoking is not the only cause of cancer, it decreased me by 3 times what i did have stacked aginst me. I plan on going and seeing him today and i am not sure if he even knows that i will be there, but it does not matter. Cancer as it may seem fast moving is like time standing still. The day you figure out that you have it. The day that you seem to not be as strong and a walk to the car will put you out. The day that you can no longer get out of bed anymore. The day that you fear falling because you cant get back up. And these are all days that all you can do is sit there and think about what you could have done, or what you have never done. This is the time in life when you start to figure out what life is all about, the little things are the only things that matter. All the times that you spent upset and angry over stuff that is absolutly silly.The flashbacks of when you were a child and the countless times that you smiled. This is where the old saying comes to the surface "Never take each day for granted".   How is it that we hear those words and think strongly of living by them, but we always fail. We get mad at people that surround us, things that never go our way. How can we stop being this way? It should not take being there in the last complete stage of your life for us to figure out that the saying is true.

      no time no time no time, and making only a few dimes. I really dont even have time to blog, but felt that i was letting a few down.My burn is almost gone and i am still on a steriod pack from that. Just in the nasty peeling stages of what seems to be sand paper heaven.The last week has been, well, hell. Its been crazy from one thing to the next and seems to never speak. I have seemed to dis-own everyone i know and still am far from sane, is that possible? Sure people stay crazy when they are alone, or is it being alone that makes them crazy? hey, how about it does not matter, eesh. My head has been spinning like a horrer movie gone bad and the throwing up feeling in my tumm tumm has ceased only bits.Have been nasty busy here at work and nasty busy at Petco, they feel that since i will be going out of town, they need  to work me as much as possible till then. I will be leaving at 5pm when i get off work on Thursday (aheam, tomorrow).Jason,Mika,Isobel and Me are shooting off to Iowa. So the last couple of weekends i have somehow managed to get to the racetracks and damn i want to get back into it so bad. I have about 3 buds that race and i love to watch. This is where i need my supa-honda.I will try to be better about posting here soon, i will post some pictures from my trip!  Eric called me and i was busy and said that i would call him back, and never did. ( i am an ass for that)I hope that he does not hate me for that. Thomas has semi been in contact,words on messenger and an e mail here and there. Chris in ARKDEL-has been really needing to talk to someone and i have not been there like i need too! Ed, damn you are offering one hell of a package! A spa is supa-nice and i have never done that before, pamper me, owww. no contact from Ken. Jason has been on the nerve brink, but slowly coming back to safty.(or maybe i need pills) ha. Painting has happened (  Went to Chris's funeral and coped with that pretty well, just did what i had to do. I miss an Eric conversation. I feel the need for a good ass kickin on the street (car wise) and just a bimp and coffee. Today is long, so long, and i feel that it will never end. I dont have to work tomorrow night at petco i will be driving with two dogs up North. UP NORTH, where the people are nice and well, just damn smarter. And i say that being from the South all my life, would like to grow up where my kids have a chance of being smarter than me.   Need to practice with my camera, its pathetic how my skills are right now. I dont want to give up on this, i love it and want to maybe make it somewhere one day?   Will keep my my honeys posted, or will damn sure try my hardest.....

      Test introduced my Thomas, thing is, it was kinda right. It was a semi-long test with straight questions and supposed to be 100% correct. Here are my results;;;;;;;;  The Priss Deliberate Brutal Love Dreamer (DBLDf)       Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic. Excuse me. The Priss.       Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy.       These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards.    Your exact opposite: The Playstation  Random Gentle Sex Master       You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing.     ALWAYS AVOID: The Playboy, The Loverboy   CONSIDER: The Manchild   Here is your chance to take the test! GOOD LUCK!   urlLink Okcupid

      This should really be a topic I care not talk about but I find myself doing it anyway. Girls today, what is up with them. Either they think there shit does not stink or they are weird, ya know like your 80 plus cat owner. Ran into a 16 year old girl yesterday that got attitude with me for one reason or another and had your potty mouth in front of her pops. Now sure, I have the potty mouth, but I have enough respect to not speak that way in front of the parents.I actually asked her if that was her father in front of her, and she replied with her snotty "I know all the answers" tone "YES", followed by the whole head roll. I replied "and your talking like that to him"? Then she proceeded to get back into the car as I realized that this girl that has bites for her tops and barely hair on her legs, is wearing what I saw in flip me and sex me magazine the other day. I went ahead and told her that she also needed to put some clothes on while she was at it. She was like 15 or 16 years old, ok, ok, I know if there is grass on the field you can play on it, but give me a break. As I pulled away and drove the rest of the way home I started to think to myself about how OLD I must have seemed to her, heh. Even though I am no short of 24, I must have seemed like her mothers best friend. I just think that times have changed and you don't need to show every inch of skin while you are going to the library.Leave things to the imagination, ok, now I seem old.But then again, how mature was I by proceeding to get out of the car to whoop her ass? (someone needed to show her)  My new co-worker turns out to be from around Dallas. We were doing the simple chat today and she mentioned that her husband was working for a very good company and was laid off. He was laid off due to Out-sourcing, yup you got it, cheaper wages, so why not. They had to move back here and now he makes 30,000 less than he had, and now she is working. Mind you that she is working my old job that I knew I didn't make enough money. I felt bad, and will feel bad for those who are caught up in the "we will replace you for someone who will work for 50 cents an hour". There goes all the good quality ways of life, and every one starts looking at the "made in America" stickers on products a little more closely. Once again time will repeat itself. People take it to heart when people cant learn from their mistakes on a daily basis, but world wide, its just passable, what gives? I had watched a special on 60 min or something like that a month or so ago about out-sourcing to India. When you call customer service and you think you are calling down the street, you are really calling someone in India. They even have classes that they take for them to speak better english, is it to trick us, or to make us feel more comfortable on the phone, humm. Then i heard them speaking about the same subject today at lunch on NPR. How about the news just being plain scary in these days anyway.  I have to work my second job tonight, yeah for me, but will be off tomorrow. Had some nasty storms come thru here last night and did some nice damage to some of our parks, and now i have to deal with insurance. Need to take more pictures and get familer with the camera better. Need a sno-cone and a good book. Need to get some painting done, and need to play on the playstation ( i sound like Thomas, ha )  Till then my reading friends....

      The above pictures are of me acting silly on the drive home, going thru Missouri.  I had a great trip and like always, hated the return. I love Jasons family, they are awesome. While we were up there his sister wanted us to take her oldest sons senior pictures. We did and actually came out with some badass ones, those will come. His youngest sister is pregnant and im so happy! This will make her second, and her little Oliva is just a damn doll to begin with! Purchased a Playstation while i was there, this makes my 2nd one. (the first one went with the first guy) ha. So now i am able to play Tekken, THOMAS that means you have other reasons to come over! I miss the air and the laid back way of living there, you would love it too!  Here is where we were....Jasons home town! (yes i love the casino boat)   urlLink Burlington     Thomas i need a conversation with you. Ken what are you thinking? Eric i need you to tell me you dont hate me, im scared to call. Jason is burning up my playstation. Tired, so tired. Got a new girl at work, took my old job, yeah i dig her. BUT its only the second day, lets see how she turns out.  Need to paint, and miss my boss. Just one of those times, you figure you need to live life to the fullest and thats it!

      Why does it seem like things are leaving life a little more and more these days? Reagan I bid you adieu, you had a better life than most and a life than others.And that's all you can really ask for, or is it? Semi starting  to feel like a comment that my mom made once..."everyone and everything I grew up with is dying". For example, all the movie stars she grew up watching are old and some have passed.Just makes you  think on where the time has gone and if you enjoyed your stay.   urlLink Reagan   Fell asleep early, I guess working my day off yesterday and working a good 9 hours with no lunch took its toll. So here I am at almost 3 am and I cant sleep. I better get to sleep tho, I work tomorrow, another 9. I should not have cracked open this damn dr. pepper. Looking at profolios on line and wishing that I could go to school for some photography classes. Met some cool people and will give my props up to them...    urlLink Down the drain  urlLink   urlLink motion-dojo   It just started to rain here, i knew that it was supposed to rain tomorrow, but i like it when it rains at night. Very calming, soothing, and cool. The air is diffrent and the sky looks wonderful lit up....im gonna play some tekken.

      GOOD NEWS! I got it, i got the house. Im siked and so ready to move in. I signed the lease tonight and did the "handing" over of the keys.Im so ready to garden and do the house up and make it wonderful. I cant wait to cook my first meal in the kitchen and introduce the dogs to it. They will love it for the central air and heat alone.I have the house and now im broke. But thats how it goes right? Good times ahead....It even has a studio out back so i can paint. And the landlords are nice as hell!   Now here comes the hard part, moving.... Anyone have any good ideas on what can make a move go smooth? I have moved many people and moved myself a few as well, but its always a ride of sweat. I need the easiest way since i work too much already, and i will have little to no energy.  I talked to Thomas for a bit today, his voice was very calming and i enjoyed it. Still no e mail from Eric, yeah i think im not getting one. Chris at work, i love his rides and he has an awesome smile. Calvin is finally coming around to normal. Chris in ARK, i need to call, CHRIS in Hawaii, you need to write me. No call from Ken, maybe he is done? Jason seems happier now that things are coming together.   I need to buy a mattress, but had no idea they were an arm and a leg and some more of the other leg!The new furniture row over here has cheap and nice furniture, Good things happening there. There is a rug that i want there, and the sales guy was awesome. (from colorado)Im tired and i need to study, crap....  So i am also reading a new book....here it tis!      urlLink Stupid White Men   Its a treat, but i need to study instead of reading that!

      well i called the place and someone had already put in an app, but assured me that if they dont get approved they would call me. *sigh* When i get home from the second job the people next door are loud and jut plain have no respect, nothing new, as to why i am wanting to move. Today jason finds this place close to the house and im siked about it. We went and looked inside, but now its between us and two others i think. CROSSES FINGERS! I told them that i want it and would fight for it!  Yeah i kow that i am only 24, but all i want it a decent place to live where the people around you take care of their yards and have respect. Why is this so hard to find without paying an arm and a leg? So i guess i will know tonight....keep your fingers crossed!

      ok, made a choice...  I was going to go for the rent house, and come to find out that someone has already put in application for the place, my tummy dropped when she told me. But there is that little light of hope that they will be denied and i can submit mine. Will fill you in later....depressed.

      TORN~  Here are my options and I cant make a decision....  1. Stay where I am living and deal with the crappy landlords, no central air and heat, and a breaker that blows because it cant handle the power of a window unit and the washer. And heaven forbid I throw in a hair dryer somewhere in there. A toilet that I have spent many coins on because I have to have dish soap for it to flush, then we tell the land lords, they have to put in a whole new toilet. The toilet will not flush at all, when you take a bath it bubbles in the toilet. Told the land lords, they sent out a plumber and dropped sudden hints about no female products and whatever down the toilet, like it was our fault. After the plumber visit, no more than 2 days later, the toilet will not flush. Now we are able to semi get it to flush after we use dish soap. yup, right back to square one. This is after we bought a snake and a new suction thing and expensive drain-o. Yeah we do stuff that they should take care of, but we figure we will try to fix it first than to make a big deal about it. Last year we sweat while we would sit on the couch and watch tv because we could not get the house cooled, never complained. This year I told him months ago (before it got hot) about the wiring problem, hey guess what, has not been out yet. And im not even going to go there about our red-neck neibors that live next to us and the bitch on the end. We have lived there the longest with out any problem. The people move in next door and peel out all the time, make a mudpit in my yard, tear up my flowers and bushes.Both of their trucks are wrecked and not fixed or axles are on rocks that they pulled from our yard. Leave their crap in our back yard and are loud. For awhile we had problem listning to their nasty asses have sex thru the thin walls. The girl on the end always wants to park in our spot by our house and the get attitude about it to us, saying that she has talked to our landlords and they said it was ok. If you have not figired it out yet, we live in a duplex.A big house that was split in to three. When i leave i will kill all the plants that i do not take with me, and i will leave the house just like i found it. Spent over two hundred dollers on the yard alone this past spring.  2. Rent house down a couple of blocks. This rent house is alot nicer and bigger. Fenced in back yard and two carports in the front, one on each side of the house for each vehicle. Quite nice.Its almost 4 hundred more dollers a month to rent tho. Split up between two people would not be so bad i guess. It has central air and heat YEAH!!!! Fenced in back yard for the dogs, oh yeah they allow pets, pet deposit, but they allow them. 1 year lease, that means we have to stay there one year. Should not be a problem tho, we have been at the other place over 4. There is no window in the bathrooms, i like windows in my bathrooms. HUGE pantry and laundry room! Good location, but close to a busy street than what we are used too, but its not bad. Nice people around us, good yards. We have been looking forever at rent houses, the ones that we can afford are really shitty looking with window units, i want the house cool for my pups. Lots of options for gardening. I will hate it when someone takes it if i dont.We even paid to have someone give us a list if rent homes in the area, so we could stay on top of what comes up for rent.eesh.Just dont want to jump in here and find something else that is better. We couldnt take it, one year lease!  3. Move to Iowa. I could stay where i am and save a little then move to Iowa.The people are nicer and housing is cheaper. BIG houses in awesome hoods for half the price here. ALthough finding jobs are hard right now, and i hate hate the winter weather there. Would like to be closer to J's family and his sisters kids, they rock. I would move away from all my family and lose my two jobs. Its a small town and i think that LR is small already. I have to remember that i still have a car payment to make no matter what!  I dont know what to do, and there are so many things that i want to do. HELP!

      I have to give it up for myself that i have been keeping this thing updated. Almost moved into the new house and almost happy with it all. Talked with Chris in "delphia" for awhile on my way to work yesterday, good to hear his voice. Thomas chatted with me for a little while yesterday about things  that have been going on around me. Chris B.(you are amazing in your own little way)  Today is a rainy day for sure, i kinda like it. It looks like night time early in the morning, feels nice. I miss the kenster, and i miss the giddy feeling of one who is no good for me. I have work to do and i turn my headf on it, geez, i need to go home and sleep. I wish i had my own house, some times.

      So the weekend was so much work, and more work. Moved boxes, furniture, and plain crap over the weekend into the new house. A buddy flipped the switch yesterday on the meter. We were without electricity for the weekend and come Sunday morning a bud broke into it and flipped the switch. We are such rebels, ha. We took pictures of it tho, no getting us in trouble.So now we have light and lovley central air and heat. The place is semi-coming together more like a puzzle that is missing come parts.I worked 10 hours alone at the second job yesterday, whoa im tired. I have to work tonight too, eesh and without Chris. Yeah thats right now i have three Chris's in my life. Watched a little bit of Sex in the city over the weekend. I thought that carrie likes ugly expensive shoes, but shes funny. And the older lady with blond hair is sexier than alot of girls in the twentys, and thats just plain sexy. Isobel and Mika love the new house and im so glad, they just play and lay in the air cond.I will be having a house-warming party soon, Thomas you better be there~  Just seems like i know little now when it comes to my buds. I seem to work all the time and dont keep up contact.Their blogs are short and semi-life because they are just like me, and have no time. What if someone sold time? They would make a killing. If someone told you that here is a time card, this gives you a week of doing nothing but what you want and still get paid, would you buy it. You know its totally legal and there are no strings, would you think it was worth it. Of course it would be a little expensive, because after all its time. Its something that NO one has alot of. Perhaps you could even get a freeze time card... i guess that another story, but sounds good!   Went to my moms house on Sat. for a get-to-gether for Fathers day for my uncle Earl and step-dad. It was nice, im glad it was not rained out and everyone had a good time. My cousin was there, and her love life is kinda in the wind. She has been hanging onto this guy for awhile, and she is 27, he is 44 and recently divorced, yeah that makes most cringe right there.We all support, he was taking her to Mexico, and New York. He was giving her the real life, and throwing her money to buy clothes, building a house, car. All this was in a years time as he gets his divource. We are of course jealous because we would all want that, but seems to be a thin silver lining. Saturday morning they were supposed to go and get her engagment ring, and it started off bad, and then just never happend. She cried the whole morning and was a mess, cant say i blame her, it sucks. Now he does the "why are you pressuring me" "why do you want to get married so fast". We besides the fact that now she is in love and that is what she wants, him, the house, and kids. He is recently divorced and hes not ready for another one like i have told her. Its hard, it sucks and she will get over it.... we all do..  I called my dad and wished him a Happy Fathers Day. I miss him so much and thats all there is to that. He is my dad, i would kill for him. Like father like Daughter no doubt, he has done some stupid things in his life, but havent we all? Mistakes are meant to be made for a reason, that is just how lif is. He deserves more than what he has, he really does. I wish that i could win the lottery so i can buy him a house, car, and clothes to lavish in. He deserves  that, hes my pops! He has the biggest heart in the world, and i have to say that he has passed down his kind heart and loving eyes, and im thankful. I love you dad for all that you are and all that you will be. You are my shining star.....*Kiss*

      Another i hate my second job and all the people that work there. Yup it happens and i think more than it should. Our new boss is ok, but i think he makes alot of bad choices... specially when it comes  to hiring people. Yup he seems to be the shitty people magnent.Shelle feels another you can kiss my ass moment coming on. Not going to Texas to see my mom like i thought, because even tho i work EVERY DAY OFF, they couldnt get someone to cover my shift, how nice is that. I think im getting fed up with being pushed around, some would say its about time.The one reason why i dont really tell them off is because i was hoping to move up there and make a little raise or two. eesh (bites lip)Would quit but my bills should be outlawed.  I have to work all weekend , yeah for me... ..    ....     ...   . .. ..    .. . .. .... ..      ....   . . . ..

      Things are better now, just went into the normal slump, normal? I dropped him like a nasty habit and not ashamed, nope, he had chances to improve. Straight up asked him last night and didnt like my answer, so there you have it. Dont have time for the games, inless its checkers, hehe. Why did i even go thru what i went thru, yeah wont happen for awhile at least a while, ha.   Jason has written some words to me that i had no idea, its crazy the things that you miss when you dont look. His words are so true and yet placed in the wrong period of time. He mopes and sighs and i sure as hell dont blame him, because i have been  there once, ok more than once. Man i seem so tragic, but its what it is.  Eric you are the craziest guy, but so damn down to earth, how do you keep balanced? Your plans and goals are productive and very intresting, you my friend are one of the smoothest.  Thomas, where do i start, i am so glad that i have met you. You are ALWAYS there when i need to talk to you and you always laugh at my stupid jokes (did i pay you to do that)? I would love another picture in my house, hell i would love for you to come and spend some time with me and show me how to paint more like i should. Robert needs to come back around, have you spoken to him? How is he doing and i love the comic he did for me! It has been awhile since we have exchanged packages, yeah thats overdue.  Ben X~ you are a british cutie if i have ever met one.....Thanks for chatting and taking an intrest in my life. you are the sweetest, and to get up at 4 your time to talk with me, now that is some dedication!

      I think that my mind is going crazy on its own, i mean i think its started without me. The gears in my head have been turning 80 turns per second, but only seem to be going in reverse? Whats up with that? I have made contact again with eric, and its nice what can i say.I have never met a guy like him, he says what he feels and thats that. (even tho i dont always like it) I cant lie and say that i say everything that i would like too, umm nope.I would like to fall off the earth sometimes. If i was skinner than i am, would i have some of the troubles i do? yeah i know (dont base things on that) but i wonder, too much. this is what i am take me or leave me.....  I have beat someone up for mistreating a blind kid in school  I consider myself half ghetto, i always had to hold my own  I love animals   I live and breath music  I am not your harvard grad  Would do anything for my pops  Would love to say i am more talented than i am  I work too much, for nothing, to kill time maybe?  I like to eat out....alot  I am tired 60% of the time, but have massive energy to keep going  I like things i cant have  I get let`down alot  I get board easily  I love photography  I consider myself fat and un-attractive ( no matter what you say )  I love to watch movies  What does happy mean?  I have learned something that i already knew, i guess i just refreshed myself. Dont let your guard down, you always seem like a fool. You got close you got burned, you try again.

      I am at a loss of words on how some people act, i truly am. I will name no names but he has treated me awful, no doubt about it. Playing games, hardly. Playing to string me along, prob. After awhile of taking it i have bit my lip and decided that i will no longer. I have mentioned it a few times and felt that i was bothering him, so i stopped. He can do what he pleases but i am too old and too busy for the games. Not gonna live around the immature.

      Today is Friday, oh yup yup yup. Frankie is visting the office today and he loves it. Want to be careful not to stress him out. He is just going to be here for about an hour, then its back to the pad for him. I work tonight, and its all good, i need some more food for Frankie anyways. Oh yeah hes eating and eating well, very active too!  &nbsp; Robert called me yesterday, i was at work and not able to call him back. Thomas i hope that your days are better and you come back with a clear head, if your not back already. &nbsp; Supposed to rain today, bothers me none, just nice is all, just nice. Work at the first job seems to be dragging, but thats how it goes on some days.....

      The last few days have been unbearably nice. Perhaps it was the fact that i did not have to work my second job and a nice break was needed. I sure cant get into the habit of that even tho my bosy needs it. I still have bills to pay and i know they dont care much about my health, in less its a doctors bill. Thats just how things are "we are sorry so and so died" "but his bills didnt die with him". Its just a crazed world. I seriously have been breathing a little easier and things have been back to the normal pace, normal as in 7 months ago. I did a little planting and alot of sno-cone eating and straight lounging, oh yeah, the best of times have been upon me, ha.   Last night Jason got a call from his older sister saying that she wanted to come down and visit. She wants to come with her 3 kids. Finding ample space is kinda hard and just the fact that the house has to be cleaned. Im ready tho, this makes me have to get crap in order, ha. We are planning some things for the kids to do, we want them to have a supa time. They are from Iowa, and yeah, its a tad warmer down here right now.   Frankie is doing splended and eating. He is moving around quite a bit more and loves it when i spray his cage. His little tongue is so cute, he is such a gangsta.  Isobel is still acting like she is two months old, and its getting old with me. She needs to get her act together and its the boot camp for that dog.   Housewarming party is coming, just wait guys.  Robert finally wrote me, titled "the bastard finally writes" he is so silly. Whoa Robert sorry about your accident, and how bazzar was that issue....Stay away from that guy!

      This weekend went by fast as usual, that is just how it seems to be. Everyone older than me always tells me "it only goes faster the older you get". Yeah, im excited that i have stuff to look forward too. I walked into work with a smile on my face and no grudge that i couldnt go to texas, it is what it is. Worked all weekend and even showed up an hour early (7am) on sat. to get some extra stuff done. I am a good girl and my Avian Department was awesome (says david).   Jason and i went out Saturday night and i decided to drive up to a plant place. This place has been here for awhile and we have never stopped, and i thought we might as well. We get out and get more than we bargained for, but its all good. J and i met a guy that owns the place names Jerry. He happens to look and act like my dad so much its scary. I know what the guy does, if he knows it or not! We bought some plants and ended up talking politics with this guy. He gave us some free plants too, oh yeah i rock. It was awesome and i plan on going back!  Sunday night about 7pm i went to get my nose peirced. Oh yeah, i did it. I will post some pictures later of my latest ring.Its a little tender today, but nothing that i didnt expect. Jason went with me, he seems a little less more excited to be there than i thought. I would love to get another tattoo, what would i get?  FRANKIE WHo is Frankie you ask? Frankie is my new Leopard Gecko. He was donated and he was adopted my me.he cost me a penny or  two setting up his cage, reptiles are not cheap you know~! I named him Frankie because he is SOOOO pimp, he looks like a little gangsta! Here is a picture of a L. Gecko, not frankie, but so you know what he looks like. I seem to be having problems with him eating.....    urlLink Looks like Frankie

      Here it is Friday night, i just ate a salad with alot of olives. Just finished up watching  urlLink  Rachel Rays 40 dollers a day.   This show can be very intresting. Anyone who likes to travel and eat should tune in. You can learn a few things and get a idea for dinner.Will warn you that i think Rachel Ray is kind of korny, its her laugh or maybe its what she is just told to do. hummm I just learned to laugh at her, makes it better that way. She also has another show called  urlLink   30 min. meals .  &nbsp;Good for people on the go like myslef....   Paid my bills today and someone might as well have beat me up. Thats life, you spend what you make. Looking for a third job, quite possibly. The local Ihop is hiring and its the hours that i am not working already. Oh yeah, i would love to serve drunks and fight for good tips? This weekend i plan on doing things around the house and getting stuff taken care of. Dave Matthews  urlLink  "grey blue eyes"   playing now.. I actually listen to this album quite a bit, and even over and over if you will. Just good home music...   So i was pulled over the other day by a guy, yeah i was stupid for pulling over, but i did. Of course it was the normal, i just had to talk to you bit. Asked for my number i told him that i was engaged (stupid lie michelle). He still persisted and i hate guys like this. They give me the "he will never know" speech. Instead of getting mad anymore, i just laugh and simply walk way, its better that i not give them a peice of my mind.   Have not talked with Eric today  Ken has not called today, kinda odd  Ben's trip to Germany is coming to an end, well see if i get a post card (ahem)  Chris from Texarkana has not contacted, he usually calls or messages every day, you ok?  Thomas and i exchanged words, how is Jen doing?  Chris in Hawaii, i miss you, hows the kid?  Robert called a night ago, so glad he is working on another comic, its just badass  Chris in LR, your an asshole, glad i dont see you anymore...grow up!  Hoyt and Brandon-still going to the club tomorrow night?  Tiff called tonight, silly girl  Jason, due time things will be better  Kelley-man you are something i tell ya, one can get caught up in you if they let themselves  Blake-Sunday coffee?  Steven-times up, i will have to get my damn money you owe me-watch for me...  Ashley, you will soon see what you have become  Calvin- hows the kitty?  Holley-sorry i never called you back  Matt- yes i will go fishing with you sometime  Jeremy- u need to step it up  Michael-going to the club with hoyt, brandon, jason,tiff, calvin and me?  Michael from work- you will get her back   &nbsp;

      After careful consideration, and a few talks with myself I think that my body is quite gross with the stuff i eat. Ok Ok, so being on the phone with Eric while he goes groc. shopping is prob. what did it. He eats fruit and nuts and all the organic good stuff. He only talks and thinks about things like  urlLink Krispy Kream , and never goes there to get the warm right out of the cooker fat goodness. He remembers the taste, and he would love too, but he knows they are no good. Do i have the mental capacity to take this challenge on? I would love to eat healthier and have a nicer body (ahem, a treadmill is coming soon). Things that i am bad about:   Pizza~ (Italian food in general)  Bread~  Sodas~(getting better at since Supersize Me)  Reeses P. B. Cups (they are so good out of the fridge tho)  Chips and Salsa get me when it comes to Mexican Food   I need to treat my body better, after all it is the only one i got. If you dont have your health you dont have much? But what about all the crappy goodies? Oh me O my how i want some pecan pie....(thats right im from the south) hehe

        So this is why Jason is so smart, ha! I will share this link with you and im sure you will be hooked like I am. Thanks for the link Jason .....     &nbsp;   urlLink  How Stuff Works    &nbsp;   Bank account was kinda screwy but I guess we figured that out? Isobel extra playful at lunch and Mika just wants to be loved. Work number one is good today and I will hope that work number two will be the same.  &nbsp;  So I have a stalker as well, kinda interesting. He has my e mail address but wont e mail me questions to get to know me. Instead he looks my friends up via e mail at a workplace. Kinda scary, but it really doesn't take much to do that. (ask Jason) OR go to the link above, ha.  &nbsp;    Kay and the kids are not coming this weekend like we had hoped. Don't really understand, just kinda want it to roll off the back. I was looking forward to that. So now I have the weekend off, I think I will work instead. Yeah it just happens that way. I would actually like to take some time out this weekend and just take some pics. I have spent little to no time with my camera, actually none since&nbsp;I have moved into the new place.     &nbsp;   Today seems like a sage color I don't know why, it just does, do I need a reason? Plants and air and sun peeking thru the trees type day. A slight smile from me and a wiggle of your nose makes the day quite complete.     &nbsp;   Made a really sketchy contract today and made J sign it. Not that I needed it, just to kind of make me stay with my words. Temptation is brutal. Jason of coursed laughed and I had a case of the gritted teeth when I signed. Example:  &nbsp;  I Michelle Ivy will not buy any Clothes, Shoes, Purses or other unnecessary things for the next two weeks and this also includes eating out. Also means no getting my nails done. I can only pay for my bills and gas in my car to go to and from work. This is for the next two weeks!     &nbsp;    &nbsp;   X  Michelle Ivy     &nbsp;   X Jason     &nbsp;  (hey I didn't say it was professional, quit laughing) And this is really odd as well because im not a girly girl. Im not all about my looks, but I do want to try sometimes, ha. Trying to save money is my goal, and this is also how I make life a little more interesting on a daily basis. Or maybe I have a huge betting problem, heh.

          This weekend was nice and soft. I had to work on Sunday, but got Saturday off and what a difference it seemed to make. I was able to run in the grass with my dogs and Isobel thinks its the cool thing to do to run in&nbsp;front of mama, hoping to trip her. Mika just stands back and shakes her head and she is to mature for reindeer games. I made Jason get up early on Saturday and go plant shopping with me.We cruised on over to Maumelle&nbsp; and went to a nursery that I saw days before doing a co-worker a favor. We bought some &nbsp; Mexican Heather, and some other bushes that I cant think of the name now. Planted them and sweated my toosh off. It was so&nbsp;hot, and I loved it. I had sweat drippig off my face and was downing water like a dying horse (yeah, no one said I was normal). Jason helped me plant some but made it&nbsp;quite clear that he preferred the shade.        &nbsp;   Counting down the days until Jasons family is in town. 4 days to be exact and that's 4 days that I will stress that all the crap must get done. But im kinda laid back about it, it will get done. I have been kind of laid back about alot of things lately, just roll ya know. I have been touch in go with a lot of my friends, its just a hazard of the two job appeal. Trying to think of some cool things to have Jasons sisters kids do while they are down here. Maybe someone has ideas? 1 girl, two boys- boys are teenagers and the girl is almost 7. It wont be that hard to please them because they are from a small town, so its things that we would take for granted that might be fun. I wish we could run down to Dallas and get some Six Flags, but that's too much trip for a weekend.    Went with a bud of mine to get her fourth tattoo. We&nbsp;are the opposite when it comes to that. I have&nbsp;11 piercings and 1 tattoo. She has four tattoos and just her ears. I guess its all about what you like. I&nbsp;have been thinking of getting another tattoo. I was kinda thinking about an Ivy Vine (hence my last name Ivy) with my dads name. Dunno, may never get another, but they are sure damn addictive. My nose is doing well with no complaints. And I almost got&nbsp;another piercing when I went&nbsp;with Tiff. Thin line between classy and trashy I know, im&nbsp;aware.&nbsp;I put some purple in my hair this weekend&nbsp;and its awesome, I love the color, like a striker color,&nbsp;growwl look out daddys.     Listening to Jeff Buckley and its quite nice. I used to listen to him (grace) on a daily basis for like a year almost. It was almost kinda sick. Now&nbsp;i hear him again after about a month of&nbsp;no Jeff. ahhhh. sweet. And i heard the song that has been my ring tone&nbsp; for months now (bittersweet symphony).  urlLink  http://jeffbuckley.com  &nbsp;Yes this site is a daily run across....    Frankie is doing well, i bought him some new live plants and he seems to LOVE to knock them over after mamma puts them upright. It was a game for about 5 min. Then i decided, ya know thats his home, he cen do as he pleases.     J and I are thinking of getting a treadmill or a weight set. Crap then i have no excuses for myself, ha. I would love to have one actually. Will tell you how that turns out.    Wanna kill some time.......   urlLink http://infinitefish.com/ping/     &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      She grew on him like she was a colony of E. coli and he was room-temperature Canadian beef.  They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences that resembled Nancy Kerrigan's teeth.  Her hair glistened in the rain like a nose hair after a sneeze.  She walked into my office like a centipede with 98 missing legs

      Thursday night and counting the hours till i know i have to force myself to go to bed. Yes, this seems to be&nbsp; a nightly thing. I will watch the clock and i know about 1 to 2am i have to hit the sack. But i guess its good to know that once my head does it, its light out baby. Honestly i know its nothing new as far as some guys go, but what is up with the "im so into you" and then no calls? Its insane shit and trust me im not going down like that, ha.   I want to meet some cd mixers and senders, am i the only one out there? I want to meet people who will burn me cds of there fav. music or stuff they think i cant live without. You can always tell the kind of thought that someone put into them too, its great. I will return cds by far, its not a one way street. Packages are so kick ass and i love to get them. Its happened before where i have had a shitty day and get home and there it is, in my mailbox, someones time they put aside for me. Yeah its all good, all good. I love it when they tell you they picked these songs out because it reminds them of me. Thats badass for several reasons.... one: Time and Effort Two:You listen and wonder how they think it relates Three: its just plain sweet by gosh   Thomas has a new haircut-cute by the way if i never responded...  Counting Crows playing and Mark Rothko is No. 61 (rust and blue) for July..i think its one of my favs. SO much emotion and heart in that one, yup yup.   Things i like dammit:   Calls for the hell of it, yeah that person is thinking of me!&nbsp; Text me at all hours, i know your up in the weeeee hours thinking of the Shelle? Hell yeah...Ask me how my art is coming, invite me somewhere, but not get upset cause i have to work, knowing ill give you a raincheck. Talking about cheaters with me, or watching it with me and laughing. same as before with Reno 911. Understand that im thick right now, deal with it or get the F off my phone. Responses to my posts, Chris was the only good guy bout that. Thanks Chris... Telling me i smell good, telling me my skin is soft. (and it is) Paint my toenails, massage my feet. Pick me up and tell me we are going to kill the day, and just go out and do crap all day. Take pictures with me. Brush my hair and sneak closeness to the neck. Light candles. Put gas in my damn car. Paint a picture for me. Burn me a cd.Have me laugh so hard i snort (hard to accomplish) Take me to a fountain and you initiate the taking off the shoes to wade in the water. Understand that i do have hard long days and have sympathy for that crap. Ask me if i would like you to kick so and so's ass for being a bitch to me. Take me out in the yard and point the moon out to me and tell me a off the wall story. Watch me when i sleep. Love my dogs and gecko. Surprise visit me at work. Text me even tho you know im working, add a smile to my night. Let me go as fast as i wanna in my car. People watch with me and laugh at my ugliness. Understand that im from the semi-south and TEA ONLY comes with alotttaaa sugar. Remind me to take my pills when needed. Dont treat me like im stupid. Recommend movies to me, and beg to watch them with me. Leave love notes on my car, then hide and watch me get them. When you travel, where is my postcard? Tuck me in at night.Bring me a cover if im chilly on the couch. Tell me that i am everything life should be. Wipe the hair from my face slowley and go in for the kill. Hot Choc. on winter mornings, with marshm. Starbucks at any time is quite tasty i might add. Teach me things i dont know, and let me learn hands on. Run in the rain with me and tell me im soo pretty when im wet. Snocone lover.   Ok so im way out there on more than half that shit, but its my friggin blog........take that, ha.  So i sent my mom some pictures of me and they happened to show my nose ring. (she didnt know) Well she sends this tcky e-mail about how flattering it looks, like a wart on my nose. And what possesed her kid to get tattoos and piercings?And she wanted to&nbsp;know if i was doing it to be bazzar&nbsp;or to be part of a culture of sorts?&nbsp;Where did she go wrong she asks me! And she wanted to also include that fact her husbands daughter does not even have her ears peirced. But keep in mind this is the same girl that has never even bought her own car at the age of 35 or a tad older. Never married just skips from loser to loser. Always calls and begs daddy for money. NEVER ONCE have i ever called and asked for help. And trust me i have fallen on hella hard times... anyways... blah... Seeing how i never talk back to mom, i was quite shocked and grinning from ear to ear when i sent her a response. Here it is, not the best, but quite refreshing.   I do have my nosed pierced very observant you are, I had it done 2 weeks ago. I have my own culture; its called Michelle works too much and does what she wants to do in her spare time. I only have one tattoo, but warn you there might be more. Please remember that piercings are not permanent and I can take them out when I please. I also tan and dye my hair on occasion, it is also not what was given to me, but seems to be ok for the mainstream audience. You are correct Melissa has not even her ears pierced, but I myself think that I have surpassed Melissa in quite a few things in life, and piercing is not that big a deal on that scale. You have been a great mother, and I myself think that you would be very sexy with a navel piercing; its all about preference, not culture. Although this is true that cultures have tattooed themselves and pierced body parts way before we have, but I think it was not to be bazaar, but because of religion and power many times. I think there is a thin line between classy and trashy and I have yet to cross that. I love you very much, you should go with me sometime.   Love:  your little rebel shelle   Funny thing is, is that i was expecting straight hate back on that one, but i didnt get it. She said that beutey was in the eye of the beholder, and no matter what she still loves me? And that i gave her a good laugh and i know how to handle a disgruntled mother? And also to be sure to pass the same on to my kids? ODD, but i loved every bit of it....This is also the same mom who was throwing my stuff at the front door when i got my tongue pierced. She said i take it out or i get out, and i packed my bags.....

      What to say what a day... Its just been one of those, yup you know the ones. Work tonight was fast and pissy. My housewarming party is this weekend, yeah for me and people who will now have a reason to drink.  Talked to Ben today, oh yeah the English guy. Whoa, his accent was strong, but quite nice i must admit. I wish it didnt cost an arm and a leg to talk to him, or i would more, most def. He seems intresting and i would love to see some of the buildings in his town, or london. Paris is another place, ah yes, in dream mode.  Not that i didnt know it already but just telling myself again that Damien Rice is so badass. (The blowers daughter) is nice to start with, as its what is playing now.  God i want a Black and Mild.  I have a headache I have a strong will to flip the bird Im tired I have alot of work to do I have calls to make, and im not making them I have books to read and they are growing dust bunnies I have a dog that laughs at the word no, and pisses on contact touch I have sexual needs that need to be met, for fucks sake I want to have a Mix Cd war I want you to touch me from the back of the neck to my lower arch  Tiff liked what i did to her hair, and i will soon put more red in it. As for me i always like some purple, oh yeah.I am out, light a motha-fuc*ing-light. *click*

      Something that i have known for awhile but thought that i would share. If you ever want to just stream i recommend the following...   urlLink KCRW    urlLink Radio Paradise    urlLink Launch Cast Plus  (80s alternative, is a fav.)  Other Albums to look into:   urlLink TRAVIS  (12 memories)   urlLink FINAL STRAW  (How to be dead)   urlLink WITH THE TIDES  (Colours in Waves)   urlLink WILCO  (a Ghost is Born)  NEED TEEEEEES?   urlLink DJTEES    urlLink EIGHBALL    urlLink SHOCKER        Kelley writes none, Eric calls none, Thomas talks some, and there is only me, only one. Ben you are badass and i love my postcard! Oh yeah, brownie points you now have. Sorry Blake, are you hating on me?  Purple sheets, black eyes and velvet touches. you see me i see you and we do the run around. you call never, you say things that are quite clever and you be with me, prob. never. The aches and pains of my two job feet, and the smiles that lack in customers and hate that runs deep. The daily sighs of the world, the weight of 10 thousand ice cream swirls. The tone in your voice and the whisper of disease in your ear. A conversation in reading form, means more than you and your yesterdays score. The daily "damn can i get your number" to the silence that is crucial to everydays balance. I paint my face for you, and you sprinkle laugh a lot on the no go no show. I look for you around corners and laugh at myself when i think that i actually would breath you in for a day. Who needs wind in the trees when i dare to never go outside again. I run in my flip-flops with my shiny nail polish shimmering in the sun, you have already done the undone. You know what, fuck you in your yeah yeah yeah attitude, im better than you and im now in a better mood.  Drive Thru Please..........  Cingular must come up with some better ringtones for us, eesh. Right now i have Bitter Sweet Symphony on my cell, but would love "london calling" "Dido". Isobel plays with a sock on the bed and Mika has a lowered head. Frankie will get his night time light on and a dose of meal worms. I will get a sigh as to why and the day will end and my eventfull dreams will begin. I need to paint again, yup i miss that. Housewarmig party this Saturday? 7:30 maybe.  Had lunch with my sis and mom today. The waiter hit on me, quite cute and he was as well. Left empty handed by choice, like usual. Sis has a cheating hubby? Let me catch his ass. Speaking of catching someone, STEVEN still owes me my twenty bucks, guess what, im going to his job and im not nice this weekend, wanna join me? Its only been about 3 months for 20 bucks. Its not the money its the principal.  PLAYING RIGHT NOW: Peter Shilling (Major Tom)  Nose ring is doing good, now i just need someone to suck it,k or pet it, ha. Foot is still blue, like my thoughts.       urlLink

      The pictures of all the vehicles below happen to be cars that I am really into right now. Saturday I went from lot to lot with a camera, yeah I got some looks, but I got some pics too! All the of the vehicle (in case you didn't know) are highly badass machines. The S2000 is my fav. of course. Post and tell me your fav. right now!  Friday night Tiff and I were bringing in the pallets of dog food. Tiff cant pull the pallets herself, so helped her get them in. On the first pallet we get it inside and she releases the lever on the pallet jack, right on my foot! (never yelling) I ask her to please get the pallet off my foot. I finally had to pull my foot out from underneath. Knowing that I still had a job to do I helped her bring in the other pallets. Walking out to my car, got in, and noticed that it happened to be my driving foot, shit. I sat there in the silence staring at a empty parking lot, eventually I just bucked it up and drove home. Jason thought I should go to the emergency room, after pulling off my shoe and seeing a nice blue color and blood. I have a high tolerance for pain, I just get pissed at pain cause it bothers me. Went to get Xrays and had good news that nothing was broke, he said that I was lucky. The pallet did smush my foot down to the bone. I went home after that and got some sleep, after all I needed to be at work at 8am in the morning. I did, I went to work for 6 hours the next day without a break and worked again today.

      Holy Shit  Last night was a night, I must admit. I was asked to be someone's wife. Oh yeah, I had a marriage proposal. This was not a drunk man in the corner bragging about my rack and how he would like to pull on my long hair. This was a guy that a year ago I was in a 3 year relationship with, a THREE year relationship. Ken and I went thru everything you could imagine and we had some tough times. I loved him then, and I still love him now. He said that now he had learned a few things since I had left, and he has grown quite a bit. He learned that he would have not done half the things he did, now. He told me that he knows in his heart that I am the only women that he wants to spend the rest of his life with. I am the only women that has made him happy. That he would be broke and living on the streets, it wouldn't matter if he had me. He would move anywhere I wanted and travel with me everywhere, as long as I was with him. He misses my hair all over, my dogs hair all over and my clothes all over the place. *he started to cry* I loved ken then and I love ken now, there has been no change in feelings towards him, I had just needed to get out at the time. Here is the twist, I am also in love with someone else. holy crap, fuck fuck fuck. I have never met anyone like this second one, god he is odd but very loavable, what do i do? They are diffrent from each other, so i have both sides to choose from, but damn if it does not make it harder. I am crazy.  I was a little upset that Thomas and Robert didnt come, or call! But i guess i just have to start expecting that from people. I never get what i give out, its how life is, blah blah whatever.  AM I WIFE MATERIAL?
