      Woohhh...drip..drip...kaya flowing down from this jar and buttered smooth bread...and then  My saliva drips with satisfaction ....ahhh....  Early morning i went to UQ to check out what the ah beng and ah nian who have studies have been talking about and lo and behold it is as described . Beautiful  and nice view with sceneries and carefully structured campus.  Beautiful people and nice view from the top.. (meaning groups of people )  There are tons of people sitting on the grass of the campus, basking in the sun and enjoying the fellowship of many people and indeed there are varities of people .  Out in the field, is OPen market, where huge amount of students pitched the tents up and market their clubs, societies and guild of the university ranging from political, religious, adventure and even sports. I tried a sumo wrestling which involves wearing a heavy suit u know like the one showed in the charlie angels and wow ....lot s of  fun.  Met also Fats and her gang....called her fats is because she want to be called that way...her name is Fayette.so in short everyone in YF called her Fats, there is also sam, michael, alvin, williard...this guys are YF members who are studying in UQ except Fats have graduated and is now working in UQ part time as well as Michael who is studying Arts in Griffith Uni.  While i was sitting under the tree to meditate and enjoy the view, two person by the name of Steven and ummm...forgot the name of the other guy.(he looks like Malay except that he is from Brunei ). We introduced ourselves and later we talk on the things. I knew that each time time people come to talk to you in University is to get you into the club and they are from Campus Christian Movement CCM one of the many christian movement ...actually it is 1/3 christian movement in UQ,  What differientiates it is  Evangelical Students is a CF under the supervision of FES and OCF (Overseas CHristian Fellowship) is well Christian fellowship .  CCM is one christian fellowship which is linked to my old church which is Hope OF God Brisbane,  I come from that church in KL and when i told them, they were shocked and they didn't expect talking to a innocent cool guy under the tree , to be coming from the same church movement. But now i told them i am attending SIB, the boy from Brunei had a sparkle in their eyes and nodding knowlingly of SIB>  We had a great time and man i thank God for the great time i have and thinkking of going back to explore the rest of UQ. I mean it is bigger than UKM and UPM combined..and i have to get a bus to get around.  Come to think of it, it is almost 1 months i have been in Aussie and i have gone used to it the life which is kinda laidback and much nicer with the quality of life improving day by day. When i look back to malaysia , i prayed that we will reached that stage and i also prayed for the politics of the country .  I mean it is high time....that we forget our differences between our skin tones and the special rights and start to strive hard for the countries interest .  Opps doesn't sounds like me...  Another thing worth mentioning is that all families i have visitted in Aussie , is that God became the center of their family lives and these families have become strong because of the presence of the Lord. Their lives are made stronger everyday by God and testimonies that flowed out are normal . They really encouraged to strive forward for and with the Lord and prayed for my parents as well. This family here, serve the Lord as a family , though not in the same church, they still serve the Lord fervently and i believe God have a major purpose for this family.  This family here are also bonded by funnily sports, especially footie which is american football with OZ rules. Nice beats soccer anytime..man..go broncos.  Buttered smooth bread always taste so much better with kaya....kaya... ahhhh.....cannot tahan the temptations already gotta come back ......ahhhh.....Not enjoying myself here.  It is nice to know that most of the time i dreamt of time basking in the sun and not feel cold , i woke up and can really do that and  i am continue to enjoy it no matter what wai nyan says...he miss me a lot..u see.

That day i charged up my phone and guess who called...James chew and woohhh...the scolding i got ...okay okay not a scolding but the plain penangese talk and hurried invitation to come back to malaysia to practise for the talent time...  so much for the dream...ahhhh,,,,,  no more money all spend on christian DVDs...books...by the way Koorong,...the big christian bookstore here is not enourmous...but the things that u can get is huge....huge discounts...and some discounts will bring the cannaanland and gladsound down if they are here in malaysia.  i mean 15 percent of every item in the store and then later another 15  percent discount on the entire purchase...where can u get them? okay okay never mind the exchange rate....even then it is so much....  but the food....malaysia, rojak, cha kauy teow ......cellgroup... oh..yeah attended my cousins church for their YF , simply crazy reminds me of the younger days....ahhh....

      hmm...to think that someone challenged me a chicken to come back is utterly nonsense but then again...it is juz wai ngan..i mean he have a tough time missing me... Brisbane and Perth have so much to offer a tarzan like me...i mean this is the first and probably the last time i visit another country overseas and be able to go there is like heaven. The people , the sceneries and even the countries...is so different to what i am used to.  With my aunties and uncles taking me places, marketing australlia like a product convinces me even further that it  is a blessed nation and a great place to settle and even my heart have set its place on Perth..wonderful place with wonderful people.  Of course, the pasture on the other side always looks greener and indeed the people , the leaders and the country have poured a lot of blood and sweat to form what i described as a haven for a greeny like me. Back home, the pleasure of what am i experiencing is non existent and things like the laidback live , the nature and fresh air is taken for granted and polluted.  I am even attracted to the churches that just started in UWA  and i would like to serve with the mat salleh to find out what drives them and to even potray the fruit of the spirit.  But the people, the culture and yes the food of MALAYSIA, is what kept me back standing firmly on the grounds of Malaysia. But i am definitely applying for PR there to raise my family unless God tells me otherwise.  I pray that i will be able to secure a job here to even raise some money so that i can continue studying post graduate in Perth and meanwhile serving the Lord as fervent as possible . In the process, thinking of dating a girl would n't be too far...either.  Of course, let tommorrow worries itself as the current times matters the most.   Life from my point of views is abundant , like a glob of kaya on bread, always taste good and will go on forever.  JOshua "Chicken" Tan

      Woohhh....the days here in Perth are pretty cool with so many activities, especially when u have a syndicate full of unco - operative people , until the activity of a Faerie Tale. People from the usual group , suddenly their brains have lubrication and their creative juices flows, what with the stories, sceneries, clothes and makeup.  Yes Makeup , u guys , should see the amount of makeup, clothes makeup from towels and balloons for breast , wow should see the pictures. Met a girl Poh Lee her name is , which is kinda cute because i got attached to her quick as in our interest are common and the fact she is a devout Christian increases my interest in her.  I went out with her to the city several times and got to know her more even in her family and her beliefs. Friends around the seminar was making fun of us of going out or courting period... I don't know but probably i should get to know her as a friend first , cause She made a good friend.  hey enough said about girls...especially when she decided to attend our cell...wai ngan,,,hold your tongue , can't have Erin sniffing around like that.  Later....who knows....still praying to God about it....can't say much...cause my heart says Go for it.  I hope that after getting her to SIB and help her contact a cell and everything else. still praying ...i mean u know, this whole 2 weeks, after going out with her, yes , really people thought we were dating but we are not.  I really am be able to go for it but somehow my conscience says to wait for it...cause the financial stability haven't be achieved.

      hooh...i am in Perth now....thanks to the Capt Ramlan who landed the plane in the land of Down Under in a "special way" Firstly the plane did a shake from left to right and right to left....with the inflight food which sucks and forced to smile flight attendants. The plane bounced 3 times before settling down on the ground . News later came by Capt Ramlan saying the latest strain of SARS  by WHO and they sprayed the plane with disinfectant everywhere. SIok chye looks suspiciously contagious with his ever sneezes which draws unnecssary attention from the flight attendants.  Went to the University of WA , WOW - it was fanstastic, the weather is 12 degrees celcius and the University College was good, Life here it seems slow paced with fantastic sceneries and street floor so clean u can lick off it....Shops closed on 5.00 pm and the city is closed at 9.00 including the service stores.  I am glad the day before i went and bought a digital camera 3.2 Megapixel with 16 RAM for RM 800 where i bargained non stop with the guy for 20 minutes. Took lots of photos around 60 of them with sun rise on Maltida Bay , the ppl and friends.  On Sunday i went to a church nearby....i met this girl Poh Lee ...who incidentally attending DUMC who is joining SIB soon./ Both of us met up and really had a good time together....hint hint./....  We went to UWA on that Sunday morning...looking for the OCF or the church. On the day i was praying for wisdom to look for the right church as all churches here are mainstream Anglican and Catholic churches. I can't get used to it so i prayed God specifically for Spirit Powered Bible Based Ready to Serve church and lo and behold  The Lord lead us to this nice church planted by the City Christian Church...who incidentally the same mother church produced the  Prophesy Album...it was planted recently in UWA and it is known as the Crawley Christian Church...pastored by Ps Darren ..the youth Pastor...the same church who produced Walk On Water Album,  I praised God for even leading us both to the right church...that day Ps Darren's dad who is the Oral Robertson 's professor gave an AWESOME sermon. He talked about why most churches ordained pastors and send them to the worker's field and not the politician, business man or even students/ He have preached this to many churches as have ordained and annointed businessmen, students, politicians and even beggars with the power of the Holy Spirit and even on the day , lives were changed almost immediately . There was this beggar who came to church looking for food. and Darren's dad prayed for Him prophesying to the beggars the plans of God in his life. The beggar later received food and clothing, and then worked for the church and gain himself an education and now he owned one of the largest business in US giving almost half a million dollars for tithes each month and spreading the gospel like wildfire.  We had a great time praising the Lord and even then the church moves into temporary place every Sunday which happens to be the restaurant byt Maltida Bay.  I got to go...more great news...and  PS : Bought a discman , clothes, chocolates and souvernirs.

Come  back to Malaysia and have to endure another few trips with a new false tooth....imagine the odds of getting a false tooth when u are in the age of Joshua. haaahhhhh.....Argggg.....................................

      hmm..Starbucks with the aroma of coffee floating in and out of the store tempting the next coffee freak to come in and savour and subdue their strong will....and of course what tempts me to come in is not the usual thing but the wifi aroma that lures my poor computer to join in the bandwidth feast and download things.  And where do i end up in Amcorp Mall where i am handing up my last document for the graduate training scheme and hopefully i can get it.  I went and get myself a paper and guess what ...the newspaper vendor cheated me of my RM1.20 of my Intech my favourite pullout and usually the rest of the paper doesn't matter.  downloading the latest album and my heart and spirit longs for the Passion : Sacred Revolution album that is coming ....ahh well,. tonight's prayer meeting and leader's meeting will continue to satisfy my inner hunger to worship the Lord .

      brrrr....brr...cold..i....don don don't know what to write in the cold environment set by Help Institute to stimulate the cold weather for the students who are studying local and could be experienced the coldness in foreign countries and for those foreign students who comes to Malaysia to study and enjoy warmness of our countries ...well too bad for them.  Help Institute is a bomb shelter that forces a lot of refugees to type their email and blog in a much colder environment.  Well this wasn't a bad day ,,,,i have a bit of conflict with the dungeon master, my landlord about my accomodation, but i thank God everything have been settled and now i can focus on my studies.  Yeah i am returning as a student after 3 complete failure in the interviews but i choose to reeducate myself and be strong for the Lord is with me and He will never leave me nor forsake me...I have the power to overcome my life and i even claimed that promise in Acts 1: 8  Yeah baby...i am made strong in my weakness and Oh yeah...studies...I am applying to study in a professional paper full time and i get paid while studying...a meager allowance of RM 500.00. per month... and then 2 months of internship training.  I will once in a while drop in CF , to talk to new people and continue to serve the Lord in bringing people to church and to cell. To all those students who are from outstation, i will commit my life to the Lord to serve them.  Hehehe...of course with the usual humour..ehehehe

I wish that HR would just ban that rule of waiting the entire 2 weeks for employing someone,..i have gone to 3 interviews and still no reply or answer.  But God have a greater purpose i am sure...so i would choose to stand strong and even pS.Tony Armstrong shared yesterday. Do not quit for God's promises and Words will prevail.

      Haalleluyah...i haven't got a job yet..Praise God for i am not going for the camp. Tommorrow got this job interview with TMNet.. yes i kinda signed up for a company i have no choice over. Tomorrow is the big day and i am like don't know where the place is  Jalan Semarak..Wisma TMTOuch.   In the whole course of thinking and mulling over the issue of joining this job or not, I thought about my time as a student is more liberal...now hey i have to secure a job and then probably negotiate so that either Sunday or Saturday , that i can have a free day. Yes ideally everybody who is holy....say amen... says don't go for the job ..That is God's day...but for a recent graduate who have been jobless for months like me,, i can't afford to say no.. Everyone says ideally but when i asked them ...have u face any circumstances like this before and most of them shook their heads....so much for principles...because if you put into my shoes ...i guess everyone else will do the same.     Furthermore the job recruitment firms says so and the job is a contract based. therefore no chance to breach the contract. It is a one year commitment to the company. So I pray tomorrow , i can't market myself in the interview and the attitude which i bring must be christlike. Not that my attitude hasn't been that way. These few days and months , i really felt the presence of God and the plan of His unveiling everyday. I pray that even by securing a job , i would not compromise His standards..because I have seen a lot of my friends who have turned away from Him and friends because he have secure a high paying job..  I guess my blogging quality hasn't been entertaining...yes it have been a trying time and i pray that my blog will carry that jars of clay that God have hidden in the field..and that those who found the jars of clay..will buy over the whole field...and owned it.  For those who have found it, man ...that is the real joy..to laugh and thankful and continually praising God regardless of situations. I have found that by praising God in the bad times is what real joy is ...and that is where God comes in because if you want God to be faithful to you ,....you also must be faithful to God.  until next blog....

      Haaah...(intimidation), I have rejection ..from a girl...for a position in Jobstreet.com.my// This must be one of those days ...rejection which is very common in the jobseeker's world. In my plans, if i don't get a job in another 2 weeks time, i will strive even now to get a part time job in a cyber cafe and start going for my MCSE classes to further improve my technical skills.  Not that rejection hits me very hard, because hey i have receive rejection many times before and well i have grown stronger. Wonder the email Jobstreet sends me , they says my experience and qualifications as outstanding really outstanding.  Hmm...got to work on my interview skills better. I have put a lot of effort into it and it is not working very well.Gotta do more research , i guess.   Now gotta do research on where to get my MCSE training and to get a car and accomodation...hmmm...gotta put more effort. Anyone reading this...gotta pray for me...i am really desperate ..

      They are new every morning ….new every morning…great is thy faithfulness . And so sings the song, such songs are sung not only in church but also recently in my life.  Today , 2nd of august 2003, have an important impact and insight into God’s miracle. Today I touched down in Malaysia KL  airport at 6 am and I took the KLIA express train home and on the way home , I found out that I have dropped my wallet somewhere.  In KL Sentral , I have no money except some Aussie money but no Malaysian currency. I reported that matter with KLIA express but it seems all hope is lost . I have to get 30 cents from there to make a call to make trip back to my house.  I discovered not many friends in KL can I rely on when I needed help and not even cell leaders in church. Suprisingly enough , I found the friends especially Siok Chye , my former project partner , is more reliable than other people.  I phone him to get me and later while I was waiting, I am surprised my even the calmness and peace that I have in dealing with this matter. For the first time, I have not panic but took the time and effort to search and resolve the matter and for this I must give glory back to God.  I prayed to God during the time of waiting and I said to God, yes Lord, this is the problem I have and I prayed for calmness., peace and wisdom in handling this matter. I told God, that even such matters comes and I am not going to be swayed by this or disappointed  but truly I will be strengthened by God in this. I am going to stand firm and praise God for what happened. I knew that God have a purpose in allowing things to happen and I prayed for the wisdom to know what is the underlying reason on why God allowed this to happen.  I sang praises to God while waiting and I prayed . And really the peace of God is so real that it surpasses understanding and logic and I knew that God have secured my wallet for me. I told God , that even the start of this matter, now is the time of excitement , I expected already that God is going to do something exciting which I why I prayed for the wisdom to know what it is.  The miracle is that God ‘s answer doesn’t come immediately and no , God have it planned according to His own timing. I lost my wallet and like everybody who loses their wallet, you would know all hope in finding the things is lost. But I chose to stand strong and continue to praise God no matter what happens. And I knew God is still in control because of the peace He have poured upon me.  Siew Ching later phoned me and asked whether have I lost my wallet and I am surprised as I have told no one and it just recently happened. She told me that a woman have found my wallet in KLIA but have took  her trip back to Tawau. She told me that to phone her and arrange that matter. The woman, Madam Liew , is also a christian and it seems she saw the exist card in the wallet and prompted to phone Siew Ching. She attends SIB as well back in Tawau.  I mean God’s great and He is faithful to you and me. His mercy are new every morning and I prayed that I will continuously  be faithful to Him and to run to Him everyday.

      Yes , quite chun title this time,...took me a few nano seconds to think about it ...kinda like a newspaper headline and that is what is gonna happen if we all lift up our saggy butts and move outside beyond our comfortable mindset.  I am charged up even with the challenge to go and make an impact to our China bros and sis . My challenge is even given by God is to make an impression of Jesus and change their mindset of what a Christian is to them , before i moved out of my house.  Indeed Ker Ching( I tink this is the spelling, well it sound like this) , a simple underground family preacher called by God to preach the good news to the people of China. What impresses me is that this preacher is called to preach the Word by her villagers , simply because she is a bit more educated  and can read the scriptures better than the elders of the villagers.  China, as she revealed , have indeed open the doors to the world and not just that China have open the doors to revivals...yes with a s. Ker Ching is the product of the second wave of revival sweeping through the northern China , where not one individual or family have not known Jesus . In fact few villages have come to know Jesus and accepted Him as their Lord and Saviour. Even as she shared the testimonies ...there are miracles . Signs and wonders are the footsteps of Jesus ...in His Ministry and so is this time...where the Spirit go, miracles follows.  There was the time when every villagers in the whole village accepted Jesus saved one, the chief. He was a true non Christian and even tried to block his wive and child from knowing Jesus. So the village prayed for his salvation and they fasted for it. That certain day, his child have gone sick . The hospital was very far away from the village, and so he travelled that far , worried sick and trying to get a doctor to heal his son. Incidentally or God-planned, the doctor of the hospital happens to be a revivalist and he knew of the chief. The doctor told the chief that no medicine here nor treatment would heal His Son.  The doctor told the chief to repent of His Sins, and go to the church of his village and ask them for healing. So desperately and for the sake of his love for his son, he took his son back home and then he went to the church to accept Christ and later asked them to heal his son. The pastor of the church told the chief, to go back to his house and see his son, for his son have been healed at the very moment. When he went back, he is suprised to see his son completely healed.  Now is that familiar to you, found in the book of Acts, is indeed happening in China. Ker Ching told us that when they read the signs and wonders in the bible, they are not suprised because these things are happening in China, in their village street and homes.  Ps Samuel Lai 's team from Hong Kong and China can easily attest to that. Most mission pastors i have figured out are uneducated  young and willing people that God have pulled to service. Ker Ching , family underground pastor who is a miracle itself when she is called to come to Malaysia . Because of her background, with her work in the underground churches, her name is blacklisted and therfore cannot get a passport to go to anywhere.Such is her influence.  Her testimonies goes like this , she prayed that if God have really meant for her to come to Malaysia, she believed that God  will provide her the way and the passport to come to Malaysia. She asked a sister in christ on the way to get a passport because she is poorly uneducated and therefore do not know how to get her documentation necessary to get to Malaysia. That sister said that with her background that there is no way for her to get a passport . The politicians know of her name but have yet to  know her face..The sister suggested that she can register under someone 's name. But Ker CHing thought , she is going to apply a passport for five years and she can't bear to use someone'else name and which is why she decided to pray that prayer.  So when she got her documentation, she asked that same sister to accompany her to the police station to get her passport. The sister said that she would not , that if Ke Ching is caught by the police to be interrogated because of her work with the people. that sister is there to save her.  So Ke  Ching  decided to go to police station alone with all her pastoral team sending her off and standing at the edge of  the street leading to the police station.The mood is so filled with tension, as many of her co worker and parents including her mom and brother have usually been caught and been interrogated for hours because of her work with the Lord. But she is determined and she walked by faith. When she went to the police station , she met up with the same policeman who have caught and interrogated  her pastor last month. Undeterred she continue with her registration of the passport. Tension continue to mount as she is asked whether her name is Ke Ching and she said yes and this continue another time. She is then asked that her documentation have been prepared and written in English as she is explained that the Immigration department in Malaysia can't understand  Chinese so It should be prepared in English. She said that she have prepared it. She is then told , that everything plus her passport will be send to her place in a week 's time.  The minute she walk out of the police station unharmed, she called the sister who was supposed to rescue her, and told her the miracle,. The fact that she is able to come to Malaysia is a miracle.   Ker Chin's testimonies of what background she comes from reveals even a bigger clue to what happens to China. There is a major revival happening in the northen china where not one individual or family have not known Jesus as their saviour . Ker Chin is the second generation Christian in the family and she accepted Christ during this wave of revival. Each time when they read the books of Acts and the bible which states the miracles and wonders that happens, they are not even suprised because all this happens right in front of their doorsteps and people in the street fell on their knees and repent and accepted Christ.  Some of her testimonies are like this reffering to the blind sees and the lame walks. Even in the time of baptising the people , miracles happens. In the usual time of baptisizing people in the northen China,   no matter how sacred it is , it have to be a secret from the government. The best times to baptize people is usually winter because the police and the government do not go out and restrict people. Because also the number of people they are baptisizing  involves thousand of people , they have to do this baptism out in the mountain during the winter.  Before they get baptisized in the lake , the co worker of the pastoral team have to crush the frozen lake and melt the ice to form a pool of water to baptisize. That is how cold it is. Most of the people especially the pastors are uneducated and never got theological training as well as the proper training to baptize people. Later i will tell you how most pastors came about. So the pastoral team would baptisize people , each 3 times of immersion , each in the name of the Father, then in the name of The and the last time  in the Holy Spirit.  It was during the time of baptism, one of the candidates requested to be baptized. He was 73 years old and have asthma. The pastoral team  would be hesistant to baptisize this old man in fear he would die on the spot because of his ashmatic condition. But the old man persisted and insisted that if he were to die on the spot, he would just go home to His Father faster. So at last the pastoral team  baptisizes this person and lo and behold, the moment he came from the pool of cold water drenched in the cold winter, his asthma have been completely healed. There are people who are blind who came to see and the lame walk during this baptism.  The calling of the pastors are also a miracle from God proving God have prepared and chose the most unlikely people to serve  Him especially in the pastoral team. Ker Chin was called as a pastor because she is the only one in her village who is educated  and can read scriptures fluently. One day as the pastor read the scriptures and ask Ker Ching to read it and she did it so  beautifully that the people of God requested her to read the scriptures. At that time she is only 19.She argued that she doesn't  know how to expound the scriptures and she have no training but the elders agreed that she can start by reading the scriptures. Even then a lot of the elders can draw meaning from the reading. Slowly God's Holy Spirit begin to empower the moment she steps  to pulpit to read God's word. God slowly reveal to her and gave her the wisdom to understand and expound the scriptures.  Today she pastors churches and training new pastors for the underground church. For one with no theological training , God have  empowered her to lead many churches and people to Christ.God slowly also give her the burden to reach out the people in the  central city of Chinas.    The revival is so major that anyone who knows how to read regardless whether they know Christ or not are being pulled by the congregation. For instance in this village, everyone have acceped Christ, there was this one young boy who have not accepted Christ and he is being invited to come to church . Everyone who is as usual from the agriculture background with not much or no education at all, can t read properly. So they ask this young boy to come to church specially just to read the scriptures because he is educated. Later on, because the reading of the scriptures have an effect on this young boy, he repented and now that He have become a pastor of one of the  underground churches.  Ker Ching mentioned the land or the harvest is so plentiful that it seems God is on the Throne in heaven and He starts to pick  His workers randomly in order to care for His people.   God is indeed Good and His name is glorified every second in China and all around the world

       I have a desire to make this blog to one that Chill. C.H.I.L.L incidentally the Christian FellowShip from Help Institute's theme for this year..which stands for  Changing Hearts Impacting Life..lah..  Indeed we are living in the times where prophecies from the bible are coming to life and God have been working to see it come to pass and most importantly with the saints of the earth and angels and even God himself have been obeying the commandment that God have set Himself to make diciples of all nations.  For those who are reading the blog, do not take your own sweet time to reach out to our friends. Already grab a friend who have not known Jesus and start to spend time with a friend allowing them to know you and your lifestyle and most important the God that you serve.  Last Nite, indeed there were the times of refreshing ...with Ps Samuel Lai from Sheperd Community Fuk Lam Church in Hong Kong's temple street. Where Hung Hing or other gangster which made their due in some of hong kong's most violent movies lives . Ps Samuel Lai or Uncle Sam which they , the occupants of Temple Street most affectionately call, have been the most influential person in that area where he have held countless street sermons, goes out in the street ministries where he care for the homeless with acts like washing their hair and giving out food. He , desires to give back and pay back for the sins he have committed, when he was in the police force and as a gangster. He was in Jail for 13 years and finally came out . He was touched by God and now a man of God . Recently a Hong Kong show met up with Ps Sam and gave him an interview as he shares his ministeries and the people he have met including his family .   Really touched by the revelation that God have revealed upon his life . Whatever relationship we perceive on earth with our earthly father reflects our relationship with our Heavenly Father...U want to know more...get the tapes at SIBKL.hehehe

      hey good morning people or whatever time you guys are reading this. I am just thinking with so much that are happening now....I just reconsider my what mom said about doing something for the coming month since my internship is forwarded to the next month which gives me time to move and revising my stuff.  My mom told me to wake up, do something and I asked what..to do ...? She said...well if your church gott some program to do ...go and do instead of sitting down and grow fungus . And I thought WOW ! Cool!/  When i 1st accepted Christ , my parents were against it totally , persecution would come up as often as you eat your meals. Furs would fly each time i said a prayer, or read the bible or mentioned anything to do with Christ. I served with Hope of God that time in my college years in Inti College Malaysia and with the fact I am serving agressively in the area of cell, evangelism, misssion and stuff, i got distracted from my studies and therefore not showing a good example which leads to extra admonishing , persecutions and the whole works.   Friends would start to notice the very socialble person who would go the extra miles for friends suddenly changed to a fanatic..Jesus Freak . That is so cool back then and being a young Christian, I am all the more excited with everything that has to do with Christ.  But when i started my serving in SIBKL, the idea of serving God have taken a different turn and show a different side , Ps Chew mentioned that serving is not an act, a holy missions but a lifestyle very much like worship...In fact serving and worship comes hand in hand...with you doing currently what you are doing except with extra fervour and Christlike attitude. That came to me as a revelation and even as I actively do what i do , i noticed that studying is no longer hard...in fact i have learned to enjoy it with the ocassional stressing moments....   In fact i have seen serving is not another part of my walk with God ...it is my walk with God...it is an opportunity for Christ to work in me and I in Him, to do all things. Apart from it , I can do nothing. What really matters is that because serving in SIBKL , have been very encouraging, my friends and family have taken a different attitude towards serving and being a Christian. It have reinforced my principles and the way i act around them.   Just recently my project partner Lee SIok Chye, have accepted the Lord and on the way to become baptised and it never ceases to amaze me. I have prayed to God to touch him even as we started to become good friends as we started our 10 month project. Since then he have come to accept the fact most of the time i have given is to God. But it wasn't my lifestyle.... In fact God have touched SIok CHye is a totally different way far from what i have expected.  During a trip to our graduate training seminar in Perth , SIok Chye have visited his uncle's church in Perth. His uncle, a fervour christian, gave him a bible as well as share Christ by showing him scriptures, the people , and things . As a farewell gift, his uncle gave him a set of tapes from Hong Kong pastors. During this sessions, different pastors from Hong kong would stress on different part of life and the trials that they go through and throughout the entire time...it have been loadful of anecdotes and jokes made.  It was at this time, God have slowly planted the seed and slowly with the people God have called to service from the KL Baptist Church, they took him through cell, services and sharing that eventually lead him to Christ.  So from my view, it is not I , that made the impact on SIok Chye, it is God who have lead him to God. God , even from the Word didn't just showed His example on earth but also from His Throne. And I am truly awed even at the miraculous ways He have in His Sleeves ...to reach to His People.  I am now even more challenged to share God with other people and to lead them to Christ,  Even God is doing the command that He have left and indeed He is God over His words.....SO i challenge you today.,,if God is doing His own Commandments,,,,what the heck are we doing here reading my blog?  Go therefore and make diciples of all nations, baptisizing them in the name of the Father, the son and the Holy Spirit , in Judea, Simeria and the to the ends of the Earth  Amen.

      Maginificent ..Holy Father...I stand in awe of everything i see....and so crooned ..the song Offerings : All I have to give... And even in Amcorp Starbucks...I am truly in awe of the things..situation...people...and everything God have planned for me...and everyone else...I mean even He endowed with all His Power to me like Bruce Almighty....I would not have the wisdom to arrange all this and words cannot truly ....express it...  Everything that i have laid down, my life, my careers, my accomodation...at the cross and really believe it by faith...I claim that promise everyday that God is going to do with my life...I just have to sit back and really pray about it... And suddenly....there is that peace, quietness and calmness in that heart that everything works out for the good for those who loved Him. He will lead us to quiet waters and green pastures...only if we let Him.  Accomodation recommended by Auntie Cecillia( for those who doesn't know Wai Nyan 's mom) (Ps: Hope i got the spelling correct....) , Graduate training scheme approved , along with several job offers that i have to turn down....all coming down like manna from Heaven...and what do i do ?  All i can do is just reach out my hand to heaven, and start praising God and worship Him...to me...it is not just the blessings but the response from God lifts up my faith...  SO want to encourage you guys,,,if your plans are not going well, it might be that your plans are not right before God and you are not right before God...so take your time...to spend time with Him and offer your plans before Him...   I was reading God in the Lord of the Rings that day where Tolkien's and C.S Lewis 's translation of the Lord Of The Rings and what message is Tolkien trying to bring in the Lord Of the Rings is truly amazing.. Even in the coming Return Of The  Kings....signify the return of the King that will redeem everyone...and restore the ruins that the evil one have done , to its former glory , even more magnificent than the former. It speaks of Jesus, coming back to redeems Us vanquishing the Ring... The Ring is sin, which all of us are bound by it , deceived and seduced to possess it by whatever means we have.... The Act of Frodo trying to bear the ring's burden, consumed by its evil....but still take it to Mount Doom to destroy it speaks of sacrifice...speaks of Jesus...  Frodo brought the ring's evil upon himself ..suffered through and well....i shall not reveal the ending of LOTR : Return of the King to you...or i shall get stoned later.

      Boringness have crept into my life this one day...in ipoh...kinda reminds me why i liked KL better , with friends and family... But of course nowhere except Oz can have the same quality of drinking water and air as it is in here ipoh....  Of course food alway taste better in Ipoh ...at home or at the town of Ipoh. Awaiting my dentures and my glasses have extended my stay in Ipoh plus the enjoyment of time talking to my folks in a relaxed manner is nothing to be bargained for. God have been truly good to me ....He have provided approval for the PSMB thingy as well as job interviews...but i have to reject them for the first time because i have to go through the PSMB scheme....  Yeah advertisement time....if anyone knew anyone looking for roomates and knew someone have a room to let in SS2 please let me know cause i have to shift to a more conducive environment to study..yes to study .. My preference is a single room with a budget of RM250 - 300 . negotiable.   Yeah boringness and continue desire to blog is unbelievable....ohh...welll that is anotehr blog

      PSMB or the acronym is Pembangunan Sumber Manusia Berhad....which is translated to Human resource Development Corp, is what i applied for ever since i have run out of subjects to study ....especially i have just perfected my studying techniques...but then for me, it have been a long time and bout time i started to come out of studying ,,,,,,,  I was wrong after surveying the outside jobs and found that even after years of toiling for a degree, it is just not enough to have a degree. Other things that counts especially to pursue a technical career, and...well what a long story but then it is Joshua 's time to make the long story shorter....  One of those days while i parousing for jobs in the jobstreet.com.my and the advert caught my eye literally and I applied for it... As had happened to my past job searching applications, it got rejected because they have unclear details on certifying the documents...i have sent it twice before it have been approved.  I am studying again thanks to this and i am starting this Monday...similar to Wai Nyan, starting a new chapter of life in another college except this college have not a CF. Hey now i see an opportunity...hmmm....president of Info-Trek Christian Fellowship....ITCF ...that is nice....  But then i am not the president material, i tink i shall stick to serving in college ministry....  For now i am still stuck in Ipoh preparing my car...yes i am getting my car in the next few weeks....preparing my false teeth following a few hours stuck in the torture chamber (dental Clinic) that strikes fear each time i brushed my teeth and the sound of the drill still haunts me at night. Can you believe it ? I asked my mom certain questions pertaining to what if i get a girl and there starts the occassional never ending bombardment of questions about the girl instead of the usual questions of career.  I can't wait to get back to KL and have my cell meeting and meeting all the strange people again.  Come to think of it, cell ,haahh...now that is home but all good things must come to an end...with so many members going off next year and even my cell intern and cell leader.....What is left is just Wai Nyan and me....ahh But then this is not concrete whether Daniel will leave us....  5 of us will still lead Simply Utd, with me , Wai Nyan, The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit. Imagine a cell of 5 , we can do so much. I mean we can do it any time....hehehe......If not enough we can ask the angels to join in too....  Think that i am crazy....no just having fun time ,,,,]  Hey God always in control...and God will provide the cell for us and a plan ....probably a bigger plan for us But we have not seen it yet. Ohhh welll....   Just want to praise God for all the God things He have brought to us...an approval for me to study and hey even a bigger news.  Siok chye my project partner and best friend have accepted Christ or so I think ...because he have invited me to his Baptism. Heheh God is good alrite

      Finally ...Starbucks Wireless System is back on and Joshua the FreeLoader is back online ...well i can download stuff in Starbucks rather on College Wireless System.  Battling through the forest of coffee aroma and the people sharing the same network and when all things have pass,  well i am all alone in the downloading stuff in the starbucks while waiting for my time in Cell..  Ha ...doing cell ice breakers....there is a lot of things that worried me and well after talking to Lee Fern and having her testimonies of even seeking for a job....blessed me a lot and i owed it all to Jesus...the keyword for me is obiedience and believe.  Even as Ps Au Yong...yes the older wan , preaching about the fear of the Lord, i believe that i need to regain that fear of the Lord by learning to trust Him and obey Him...even in prayer i must learn to pray like a dog and stop being a cat....confused? well that is another long story....  First i must get rid of the fear of men and insecurities that binds my life currently particularly the job and a place to stay... I must get right with God and some of you may suffer from me...endless talking and rough jokes is,  that i tends to be more of this way when i have stress....instead of sharing it out, i becomes more than i can be,...  So i want to ask forgiveness from all of you whom i have robbed the attention from you and hope that you will forgive me. I have gone through a lot particularly from the housemates, job seeking and the landlord.  So pray for me as i learned to pray for you guys as well...but hey I am still me ....Simply Me..

      One of my major fear ...not in conjunction with Fear Factor in Church.....is that yesterday i received a phone call from Jobstreet.com.my and it was a phone interview ...so i parked my car to the side of the road and begin talking to the fella....  All of a sudden , the phone died lacking of any power....i panicked and i droved my car like you see in Bad Boys II weaving in and out of the road courtesy to the training i received when i play Need For Speed.IV., rushing in time back to my house and to pop the phone into the charger..but the guy never called again...  I mean the interview was great ...although it lasted for 2 minutes and he was asking question pertaining to the job and well ...i could have that job...now it seems bleak...cause Jobstreet.com.my have a private number which is not identifiable with the caller ID in my phone..  But the whole day wasn't brought down by this incident , i have a great time in LoudRoom (SIB College Leader Meet) and we contributed our thoughts together and well....later mamak time was a blast.  Haaahh...it's back with the old sighing of a jobseeker's future and current times....it is both an enjoyable time and a sanfu time ...especially the waiting for the call for an interview..

      What a wonderful week ,...although this is the middle of the week, to start with, my training have a bit of problem with funding and therefore suspended for the moment, which forces me to start job seeking again to regain some opportunities in securing a job. Then i have to learn that the girl that i kinda like , is seeing someone else. Man does that bite.  Boy am i glad that..i started off with her as a friend...but still it bites pretty hard...but then having done nothing that is considered pursuing ...is short of anything.  But there are some small joy, in seeing some of the mailing i did , that is to the Star got published and hopefully it will get some attention. And then i just send a mail to the Chief Executive of the Human Resource Development ministry and i pray that will spark a reply.   This whole week, i can see God really providing me things at a time when i am broke literally in terms of finance. When i needed a game , He (God) provided me the funds from friends. When i needed a drink, He sent Melissa my way and Gavin, his uneaten chicken. God is really awesome in every sense and what amazes me is that friends are not just gifts from God ....they are manifestation of God....meaning they showed the characteristics of God. God is a friend who does not mind what background you come from and take into mind the situation you are going through and be with you .  I attended cell last nite and lo and behold, food is poured on the tables rite in front of me...Incidentally it is the combined cell for pot bless and a farewell party for Karen Lim ( Emillia and Daniel) eldest sister. I have come to cell on the intention to look for young adult cell and i come with the thought that i know no one and vice versa but in fact most of the young adult knows me quite well.   Have fun in that cell and that lifts up my spirit and the energy to just go on with life...God strips away bit by bit , the things , the comfort and wonderful things i hold dear....in order to prepare me for the wonderful things that He Have prepared for me. Look at Job, Joseph, Paul...the heroes of faith...most of them are stripped of the things that they hold dear ...but when God uses them and blesses them, the blessing a hundred fold....  Knowing that , lifts up my spirit and encouraged me to pray and prepare myself for God's usage...A lot of people came and critisize the way i trusted things to work...and suggested ways to get out of the situation.But it is not i trust the way thing to work but i trusted God to make things work.  So i challenge you to pray with me not for my situation but also for your situation , pray that God will not move you out of the situation you are in , but pray that God will help you to overcome that situation. Consider it pure Joy to really walk with God just like God walked with Adam in the Garden of Eden. To talk with Him and fellowship with God without any shame and guilt with ever boldness and faith,.

      Apa Khabar? Okay lah...fine...good...cool...was the reply mostly ...i mean where's the life that God have poured upon our lives.. A word have been given during worship on Sunday ...that is change coming , and we must learned to receive it with joy and that change might change the way we do things and our situations.  Well, it came sooner than i thought, I mean a cross over to the area of promises ..to me i am not sure...but i chose to hang on like always knowing by faith God have something exciting prepared for me. I know there will be criticism , there will be jokes or even persecution for the things that happened to me, but when i looked back, i chose Jesus to hang on to.  My training have been left hanging as a result of the Human Resource Development Corp 's inefficiency in handling the matter and now i am left by myself to look for a job as soon as possible to cover up the time i have lost. A backup plan have been drawn and i prayed God will annoint that plan and help me to rise up.  So I plead with the rest of reading this blog to pray for me to have strength to face the promises and challenge that God have in store for me....to walk by faith and in obedience to His Words.... My carreer path lies in God's hands....  Other than that hey, it is not a time to moan about it but it is something to be done about it....

      Had a pretty bad start for the week, especially in the area of finance and boredom. For the beginning of the week, i have spend an enourmous amount of money to buy stuff for my room, with the once in a blue moon trip down to Ikea.I have to rebuy some toiletries and well send my clothes to the Dobi, cause well in these past few years, in the house i have been spoiled with having a washing machine, semi-automatic one but still. What with graduation convocation coming, all the more must save my money. Which is why i must slowly stop eating so much , little by little, to prepare for a fasting .   Me, i am very noticable in my physique, if i get thin, well you can see the difference and when i am fat , which is all the time, you can see it too.. So well , i am comfortable with who i am and how i look, but there is a burning desire to improve myself so that i can do all things i can't previously do before. I must exercise both my faith and physique.  Ragnarok Online was one of the past time, that i have played , to keep me entertained with something to do.  Hmm..prayer meeting is tonite, i must go there....just to immerse myself in the atmosphere of faith urand corporate prayer....about the encouragement...well cannot think of a title...so  well Let's pray and fast for the loves ones who have not known Christ. Pray for those who have resisted the gospel and for those who are your enemy. After the lesson God taught me about Siok Chye, i have not begin to doubt what God can do....a lot of my christian friends who always thought that Siok Chye 's fate of not becoming a christian, is predestined. Well to hell with predestination or some theology arguments about this and that...It stops us from doing the real work...

      Oh yeah...come into His Presence and lift up our voices, hands, hearts to Him for He is the King over all all the earth. Dance Dance ...Danc before the King, I give you everything.  Oh yeah ...When i get my hands on a dreamweaver, i am gonna insert music into this blog and we can have praise and worship rite in this blog. Ohh..For the time being , well i am going to focus on how to improve cell , especially in the worship part. I seriously hope i can ask Jamie and wai nyan to help out cause we need to rise up , we are no longer just attending a cell, we are leading people to enter into the presence of God, It is an important event for the priest during David's time and now we can have the privelege of doing it . Still the attitude of doing and the reverence must not be compromised.  Well rite now with 11 days to go for my internship training, i have nothing to do than to go to college, and play Ragnarok and yam cha with my Okios. Praise God, A girl called Elena have sold a lot of raffle tickets to them and come for the family day in Praise Assembly. Which means their response to the gospel is quite good.

      Truly God is in the midst of us...and even as u have imagined what is like when David and His people worship the Lord in the temples or when the disciples is sharing the Word of God..., it is very real to us./...  And in the E03 conference i have begin to experience God in a fresh way beginning even with empowerment. That is one thing that have subsided in my life which leads to a dull, lost and no purpose life. Even as each time challenges come, it is by the grace of God that i am here.

      Yeah 2003 is ending in a matter of 2 days time and truly it is God's grace that I can be here enjoying the life and freedom that Jesus died for me 2000 years ago.  A year of Cross-over , crossing the River Jordan which marks the end of the era of Moses and move unto the Joshua Era. A year of moving from studenthood to professionalhood. So many things have happened, so many challenges, so many hurts and so many things that requires 1 thing. Surrenderring . Surrenderring my entire life..the things that i hold dear..my careers, my studies my plans..my dreams..my..umm..life partner to the Lord. Yeah I still remember doing things with  own strengths, the amount of worrying and insecurities...and it seems so easy when you are delighting in the Lord..no worries...no strings attached. The hardest things to do was to confess and to surrender every bit of my life...  There was a few life changing points of my life..particularly when i returned to Malaysia from Aussie..I stepped off the plane and straight into ERL. When i arrived in KL Sentral , i realized that i have dropped my wallet and have no way to go home ..And it was my burning bush experience..i mean God have caught my attention...the peace of God was so strong that it surpasses understanding.  After i made a report, I went and sat down in KL Sentral . I look up to God, expecting something great to happened that day...I told God..Okay ..something have happened...I am not going to do anything more...I am gonna fold my hands and I am gonna wait to see what You have in Store for me. ..What do you want to teach me from all this... God says be still and know that I am God..God doesn't just mean literally..God meant that i stopped my actions...physically,..emotionally..close my eyes and begin to worship Him there and then...so i did..I sing in the spirit, I prayed in the spirit...I practically have praise and worship in KL Sentral.. ...My fren came and pick me up...to my house. Later on, a lot of people asked me what happened later...Siew Ching..(angel in disguise) ..phoned to tell me that this lady found my wallet and was very suprised that I am so calm and not excited about it..as if I have been expecting it all along and yeah i did...There was a lady that found it was on the way back to Sabah, a member from SIBKL....a christian and saw my cards in there...and decided to phone Siew Ching and well I 've got my wallet back. One of the many testimonies in my life in 2003...How I 've got my job was another...I've beeen trying attending all the interviews and decided to get the job i wanted thru my own strength.with my own abilities and skills i thought i could get a job...I was cocky ...and although i prayed...i was very confident ..self confident. But after 5 months of doubts, hurts, rejection ,pressure,,....i gave it all to the Lord...i prayed everyday and believed that God is preparing me all this months...allowing me to contact every old friends that i have developing that humility,..that willing attitude...I continued to serve the Lord even when i am doubting God,.not sure of what lies ahead...My parents(suprisingly) asked when i have spare time....work with the church...my parents are not even Christians...and yet..God really knows how to plan someone's life.  I gave it all to the Lord...I clearly states that I am a fervant Christian...that i served in the Lord and that i am new to all this working life...but i believe God have a purpose and I willing to learned and starts from the bottom. This is part of the answer when i was interviewed for the last time...actually last 3 times...3 interviews for the job. God gave me that job when i was encouraging one great brother to let go of his laptop and  his working time to be prayed for ...Kevin Tai. That was when i was offered a job..  Of course there are also difficult challenges,...and definitely failure in 2003...but faithfulness of God prevails all.... I 've learned one major thing in 2003 ...and that is God is always in Control...  So Cross Over ...Join the Joshua Generation and run forward to the promised land in 2004  Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan

      Okay I am watching this Christian Channel in Malaysia for a few days . Yes you did not see wrong , a christian channel ...that is mostly targeted at youth and i found a lot of sermons and programs as well as MTV are very inspiring and God focused... For those with StreamyX , this is for you ..I highly recommended it , and I thank God for allowing me to watch it during my work time and i thank God for a wonderful company. The channel is called JCTV (Jesus Christian TV) , found at http://www.jc-tv.net . It have relevant sermons for the youth today. There was this cool show which is called bombshelter.org(which is a real website) , where young people (Christian and non christian ) talked openly about their situtation. Let say today was about forgiveness, the youth will be talkking about their situations, their problem and the youth who have went thru will encourage the person...There is no scripts prepared because this is a very spontaneous.  Before i thought my job was boring ...and there is nothing to do except monitor the servers and fix up computers....but when i found this channel,,this channel actually runs side by side with my company computer...so i 'll found new enthuasiasm to go to work because i am very inspired even while working. Because of this , I am able to send encouragement emails to everyone ..hehehe  So remember to click on watch now at www.jc-tv.net and watch it, Remember you gotta have StreamyX to be able to watch it....so Wai Nyan ...remember to get StreamyX... it is also 24 hours a day...if u can get yourself to a WIFi hotspot...well ..it is that good.

      Had a good Christmas with the church , cellgroup(s) and Wai Nyan's family. 3 days before that I had to go around Ikea to find my gifts for Christmas for my cell members ...incidentally Siew Ching was there on the same time...what a coincidence (not) ...(eyes looking up) buying presents. Somehow i found out that she had the same idea on how to get Christmas presents for everyone. Actually we talked about it before...  Back to the story...on Christmas...I have given out most of my presents to everyone and receives presents from those i have not given presents to...how ironic huh? oh well Praise God for cell leader(s) from both cell Pure JOy and Simply United.  Then later had lunch with an effort to join the Pure JOy cell. My intentions was to introduce the Pure Joy members to Simply United...one of the first step to get Pure Joy to adopt the Simply United people. i mean the members needed someone to look up to and get advices from. Yes Simply United was once adopted by the family cell...but so far nothing have happened. and because i know Pure jOy quite well...so... It was a great time makaning in banana leaf with the cells...but of course...a bit dissapointed..Simply United moved away from Pure jOy and makan with Sheep United...BTW...these names are cell name ..  Later in the evening, Had a good time makaning(again)  in Wai Nyan's house...since i am regular there...i treat it just like my own home and yeah the family is the closest to my heart. Having dinner with Jacob's ladder 's pot luck was a great blessing ...cause coming from a non christian family ...having a dinner like this is like a prophecy of sorts....that soon i can have the same dinner experience with my family. We makan pasta, chicken , ice cream and tempoyak...(fermented durian which i missed out while i was charging for ice-cream) . ...stayed there with the intention of staying overnight but did not work out cause too sleepy.  I started work the next morning...and since my training is almost over., i 've found out that my job is quite relaxing , monitoring critical servers, an important job, a boring job cause of its repetitiveness...but overall you get to learn something everyday. Since the internet connection is kinda strong , i get to connect my trusty laptop in there and watched broadband tv all around the world...  Currently i am watching 3 ABN ( 3 Angels Broadcast Network) ,. a christian channel network ....currently showing a seminar of Revelation which is quite good and solid...that is interdenominational.... opps got to focus...gotta get my bible....hehe  :)

But then ...i have a family here in KL....friends ...that seems like family...probably i could conduct my own visitation ...hmm...whats more with Wai Nyan most probably moving into his new house...i can probably volunteer.. Me heret typing angrily over something i must get over with it as soon as possible. Haaa....(sigh) ...i have to leave it to Jesus...Praise God i have free day off at Christmas and New Year,...but the hope of getting leave for Chinese NEw year is dashed...especially with the company excuse of probation....is ridiculous..

      I though of revamping the entire look for this blog so i have started embarking on a visual quest and have started in kayanbutter.tblog.com.  I thought of also exporting this to Flash and Dreamweaver and tried to insert some flash modules which i will later develop to improve interactivity,,,but this is also a pipe dream judging by the amount of time i have perday.  So  continue to check on these 2 sites...and well...gtg nnow

      For now, my blog would be a place where  I will put insipiration from the email i have received...and i hope i will be able to put a forum like wai nyan did to discuss these inspirational stories...and hopefully like a cell, we would be able to grow on the revelation superhighway.  Here my vision statement is to CONNECT, RELATE and RESONATE the FAITH OF JESUS CHRIST.  THE ROOM  >  >17 year old Brian Moore was asked to write something about Heaven in school.  >It was his best essay; it literally stunned his class. But sadly, it was  >also his last. He was killed in a car accident on May 27, 1997.  >  >His parents pinned this essay in the living room. "I think God used him to  >make a point. I think we were meant to find it and make something out of it,  >" Mrs. Moore said of the essay. She and her husband want to share their  >son's vision of life after death. "I'm happy for Brian. I know he's in  >heaven. I know I'll see him.  >  >Brian's Essay: The Room...  >  >In that place between wakefulness and dreams, I found myself in the room.  >There were no distinguishing features except for the one wall covered with  >small index card files. They were like the ones in libraries that list  >titles by author or subject in alphabetical order. But these files, which  >stretched from floor to ceiling and seemingly endless in either direction,  >had very different headings. As I drew near the wall of files, the first to  >catch my attention was one that read "Girls I have liked." I opened it and  >began flipping through the cards. I quickly shut it, shocked to realize that  >I recognized the names written on each one. And then without being told, I  >knew exactly where I was.  >  >This lifeless room with its small files was a crude catalog system for my  >life. Here were written the actions of my every moment, big and small, in a  >detail my memory couldn't match. A sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled  >with horror, stirred within me as I began randomly opening files and  >exploring their content. Some brought joy and sweet memories; others a sense  >of shame and regret so intense that I would look over my shoulder to see if  >anyone was watching.  >  >A file named "Friends" was next to one marked "Friends I have betrayed." The  >titles ranged from the mundane to the outright weird. "Books I Have Read,"  >"Lies I Have Told", "Comfort I have Given", "Jokes I Have Laughed at." Some  >were almost hilarious in their exactness: "Things I've yelled at my  >brothers." Others I couldn't laugh at: "Things I Have Done in My Anger",  >"Things I Have Muttered Under My Breath at My Parents." I never ceased to be  >surprised by the contents.  >  >Often there were many more cards than I expected. Sometimes fewer than I  >hoped. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the life I had lived. Could  >it be possible that I had the time in my years to fill each of these  >thousands or even millions of cards? But each card confirmed this truth.  >Each was written in my own handwriting. Each signed with my signature.  >  >When I pulled out the file marked "TV Shows I have watched", I realized the  >files grew to contain their contents. The cards were packed tightly, and yet  >after two or three yards, I hadn't found the end of the file. I shut it,  >shamed, not so much by the quality of shows but more by the vast time I knew  >that file represented.  >  >When I came to a file marked "Lustful Thoughts," I felt a chill run through  >my body. I pulled the file out only an inch, not willing to test its size,  >and drew out a card. I shuddered at its detailed content. I felt sick to  >think that such a moment had been recorded. An almost animal rage broke on  >me. One thought dominated my mind: No one must ever see these cards! No one  >must ever see this room! I have to destroy them!" In insane frenzy I yanked  >the file out.  >  >Its size didn't matter now. I had to empty it and burn the cards. But as I  >took it at one end and began pounding it on the floor, I could not dislodge  >a single card. I became desperate and pulled out a card, only to find it as  >strong as steel when I tried to tear it.  >  >Defeated and utterly helpless, I returned the file to its slot. Leaning my  >forehead against the wall, I let out a long, self-pitying sigh.  >  >And then I saw it.. The title bore "People I Have Shared the Gospel With."  >The handle was brighter than those around it, newer, almost unused. I pulled  >on its handle and a small box not more than three inches long fell into my  >hands. I could count the cards it contained on one hand.  >  >And then the tears came. I began to weep. Sobs so deep that they hurt. They  >started in my stomach and shook through me. I fell on my knees and cried. I  >cried out of shame, from the overwhelming shame of it all. The rows of file  >shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes.  >  >No one must ever, ever know of this room. I must lock it up and hide the  >key. But then as I pushed away the tears, I saw Him.  >  >No, please not Him. Not here. Oh, anyone but Jesus. I watched helplessly as  >He began to open the files and read the cards.

He seemed to intuitively go to the worst boxes.  >Why did He have to read every one? Finally He turned and looked at me from  >across the room. He looked at me with pity in His eyes. But this was a pity  >that didn't anger me. I dropped my head, covered my face with my hands and  >began to cry again. He walked over and put His arm around me. He could have  >said so many things. But He didn't say a word. He just cried with me.  >  >Then He got up and walked back to the wall of files.

      Got this from jian yee 's blog....fabulous answer and question   PLS READ THE WHOLE  THING....IT'S REALLY GOOD, how u can answer ur lecturers!!!!  "Let me explain the problem science has with Jesus Christ." The atheist professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of his new students to stand.  "You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"  "Yes sir," the student says.  "So you believe in God?"  "Absolutely."  "Is God good?"  "Sure! God's good." "Is God all-powerful? Can God do anything?"  "Yes."  "Are you good or evil?"  "The Bible says I'm evil." The professor grins knowingly. "Aha! The Bible!" He considers for a moment.  "Here's one for you. Let's say there's a sick person over here and you can cure him. You can do it. Would you help him? Would you try?" "Yes sir, I would." "So you're good...!" "I wouldn't say that."  "But why not say that? You'd help a sick and maimed person if you could. Most of us would if we could. But God doesn't." The student does not answer, so the professor continues.  "He doesn't, does he? My brother was a Christian who died of cancer, even though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good? Hmmm? Can you answer that one?" The student remains silent. "No, you can't, can you?" the professor says. He takes a sip of water from the glass on his desk to give the student time to relax. "Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?" "Er...yes," the student says. "Is Satan good?" The student doesn't hesitate on this one. "No." "Then where does Satan come from?" The student falters. "From...God..." "That's right. God made Satan, didn't he? Tell me, son. Is there evil in this world?" "Yes, sir." "Evil's everywhere, isn't it? And God did make everything, correct?" "Yes." "So who created evil?" Again, the student has no answer. "Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Uglin! ess? All these terrible things, do they exist in this world?"  The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."  "So who created them?" The student does not answer again, so the professor repeats his question. "Who created them?" There is still no answer. Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom. The class is mesmerized. "Tell me," he continues. "Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?" The student's voice betrays him and cracks. "Yes, professor. I do." The old man stops pacing. "Science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen Jesus?"  "No sir. I've never seen Him."  "Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"  "No, sir. I have not."  "Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your Jesus? Have you ever had any sensory perception of Jesus Christ, or God for that matter."  "No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."  "Yet you still believe in him?"  "Yes." "According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your God doesn't exist. What do you say to that, son?"  "Nothing," the student replies. "I only have my faith."  "Yes, faith," the professor repeats. "And that is the problem science has with God. There is no evidence, only faith."  The student stands quietly for a moment, before asking a question of His own.  "Professor, is there such thing as heat?"  "Yes," the professor replies. "There's heat."  "And is there such a thing as cold?"  "Yes, son, there's cold too."  "No sir, there isn't." The professor turns to face the student, obviously interested. The room suddenly becomes very quiet. The student begins to explain.  "You can have lots of heat, even more heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat, but we don't have anything called 'cold'. We can hit 458 degrees below zero, which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold; otherwise we would be able to go colder than -458 degrees. You see, sir, cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot >measure cold  Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it." Silence across the room. A pen drops somewhere in the classroom, sounding like a hammer. "What about darkness, professor. Is there such a thing as darkness?"  "Yes," the professor replies without hesitation. "What is night if it isn't darkness?"  "You're wrong again, sir. Darkness is not something; it is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light...but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? That's the meaning we use to define the word. In reality, darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?" The professor begins to smile at the student in front of him. This will be a good semester. "So what point are you making, young man?"  "Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed."  The professor's face cannot hide his surprise this time. "Flawed? Can you explain how?"  "You are working on the premise of duality," the student explains.  "You argue that there is life and then there's death; a good God and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as substantive thing. Death is not the opposite of life, just the absence of it." "Now tell me, professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from monkeys?"  "If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man, yes, of course I do."  "Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, >sir?"  The professor begins to shake his head, still smiling, as he realizes where the argument is going. A very good semester indeed. "Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavour, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a preacher?" The class is in uproar. The student remains silent until the commotion has subsided.  "To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student, let me give you an example of what I mean." The student looks around the room. "Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professor's brain?"  The class breaks out into laughter. "Is there anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain, felt the professor's brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical, stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain, with all due respect, sir. So if science says you have no brain, how can we trust your lectures, sir?"  Now the room is silent. The professor just stares at the student, his face unreadable.  Finally, after what seems an eternity, the old man answers. "I guess you'll have to take them on faith."

      In my previous failure stories, I have mentioned how many people God have sent to bless me and vice versa.,.yeah i mentioned Wai Nyan, Melissa Lim, James Chew, Daniel Lim and tjer-hann and whole lots of name that have starred in my life and have made a huge impact changing the history and the direction on Joshua Tan's life. There are few people whom i cherished and during the years of studying, we have given a part of our lives to each other...sharing wonderful moments in God and in life. These people are as follows; 1) Jessie Teh wan Sin , one sister whom i cherished very much , whom have given me sound advice when needed to and have brighten the days of JOshua Tan. This young , beautiful spunky girl have given her best when it comes to friends in terms of a listening ear as well as good advice and good friendship.  I miss her very much. Currently working in Citibank in JB.  2) Keith Tay Wen Chang , my former sheperd whose life have spoken so much into my life, speaking on life and Christ. One who also have given his best to serve God and in everything he does and say , comes to pass. Currently a great man of God serving with Pastor Kevin Loo planting the church, City Harvest Outreach Malaysia.  3) Bernard Janz , Tan Hung Teong and Warren Wong - best housemates you could ever hope for , who supports you morally and in everything else best friends.....  Hung Teong accepted the Lord after graduation and now he attends Eagles Point Covenant Fellowship. Bernard Janz used to be my Christian Fellowship president who happens to one of the most annointed tambourine dancer .   4) Chang Le Churn - One of the best friends that God have blessed me with. Started out together as classmates and then roomates in the college hostel, then housemates and also best friends. He Accepted the Lord in his second year at Inti College Malaysia. Happens to be one of the coolest guy in college with most of his friends which happens to be of the opposite sex. Currently stay  5) Last but not least Lum Tjer-hann - one of the hansem guys around who also happens to be my life buddies besides Hung Teong and Le Churn. Tjer-hann grows up with me spiritually and mentally,..one of those best friends given the right to rebuke me whenever i stepped out of line. Tjer-hann and me served Christian Fellowship with Jessie Teh and Keith Tay Wen Chang , as pioneers of CHristian Fellowship in Inti College Malaysia Nilai. He is now seeking employment in Penang.

      It's been a while...i have started blogging again..particularly now that my life have been turned around Praise God .  It's been A God Factor month...where the whole month....I have not stop thinking about God...i see God in everything that i do and yeah...and not just on God's blessing...but the annointing He have poured over our live and also His Power. The same power that flowed within Jesus when He Arose from the Dead ....flows now within us ...enabling us to serve Him with the gifts endowned to us and to live a life of breakthroughs.  I thank God for all the successes and even failures in my life and if you asked me what is my greatest achievement in life? i would tell you 2 things....that is I get to know JEsus...and guess the second one...  I have failed in every aspect of my life...from studies...all the way to life itself....and in that Failure ..God chooses to bring the best out of me...making God the author of my life.. really..serious... Every aspect of my life, if not the grace of God...i would not have tasted success...joy and happiness..  God have brought friends into my life....good lifelong friends...like Andrew Yeow, James Chew, Wai Nyan, tjer-hann , Melissa Lim and good cell group like SImply United and Pure Joy ....good church ...SIBKL.... and I can't name them all...but it's okay...cause i know at the end of my life...i get to see them anyway in a huge concert that goes for eternity....in Heaven.  E03 , a life changing , a turning point in my life....that have refreshens me, taught me and enabled me to use the gifts that God have promised to bring life to others.....God have to come so that i may have life and life abundantly...  Oh yeah...for those who have not known...i have been blessed with a job in EA Consultancy Asia Pacific as a HelpDesk and Network Specialist, one of the more pretigious company in the SAP industry...an enterprise software ....not through the interviews i attended, not through Jobstreet....yes those that i have mentioned have contributed a part of it...but ultimately it is in the hands of God that decide whether i get the job.  So i want to encourage those who are waiting for a job....don't start waiting for God to do the impossible... you have to take the first step in looking for a job, start enquiring about it from your friends, do some homework about the company u are applying....of course start it out with a prayer...ask God specifically on what type of job u wanted...shift based or office hours...things like that... Start to score an interview by taking the time to write out a resume and reading on materials pertaining to attend an interview... Remember ...write an impressive resume...but also be honest about it ...when interview...bring a good working attitude..like humility and willingness to learn ... It is not your qualification that will earn you the job...it is the attitude that will help you secure that job,  Don't be ashamed of telling your future employer that you are a christian. The fact you have a strong belief system concretes your attitude and character. that you have integrity in what you are doing..if given the chance...telll your future employer what did you do in church.   All in All...God is in Control! Praise God

      30 hamz...opps forgot to take cards...60 hamz ...99 hamz...opps no more cards...aiyak die alredi  Okay just learn a new card game from Pure Joy people as we went and visit Winnie and Jeevan , our cell leader and when we arrived there, it was already raining ..Just before we had Taman Tun 's famous Lo Shu Fan. Fanstastic meal with equally fanstastic people...  When we arrived in Subang Jaya, well we found out that Jeevan and Winnie had a fight and he left home...leaving his poor pregnant , wife alone...our cell leader...So irresponsible..... or is he being a good husband?  Actually in his office before the few days, someone caught measles and therefore he called Winnie to tell her , that he is spending some days from them to avoid her and the unborn baby from getting measles. So Winnie dutifully drops his packed clothes in front of the house and went to the back of the house, while Jeevan collects his clothes...but at the same time ..try to peek thru the house to see his beautiful wife and tried to catch her eyes.  Before the cell came, Winnie was informed by Jeevan to tell the cell that they had a fight and therefore could not stay together any longer. So when we came, she pulled a straight face and told us Jeevan have left her becoz they fought. The rest of us stopped what we are doing and some of our hearts sank...can see so many of our faces dropped...stared at her....but she could not keep her secret long...so she told us about the measles...then we like ...sigh loudly...of relieve.  Had a nice time phoning Jeevan, firstly all of us scolding, rebuking and pleading with him to come back to his wife ...pretending all this time...we have not known about the measles...Jeevan thought that we are really angry with him until later when Jenniffer Tan could not contain her laughter ..and Emillia could not lie so yeah.....hehehehhee  Had a good time chatting with one another and playing a new game introduced by Huay Phing which is called Humz...one day we shall play at Simply United...hehehe  Okay got job training soon, so i'll have to go now...Blog u guys later   Joshua Tan

      I woke up early this morning at 6.00 and made up my mind to go jogging. I pushed my body to do it cause i don't feel like doing it. And i made up my mind that certain habits needed to be removed or certain habits needed to be cultivated to culture .   So i drove to Bukit Kiara this morning , put on my Discman and have decided to do 5 full rounds this morning. and i did,..during the 3rd round,..i can feel my body feeling much better with all the sweats and of course being able to breath fresh air in Pj is a miracle. As i was walking , i have time to meditate on several things ..Godly Things mind you...The verse The spirit is willing but the flesh is not...and i just thought ,..good verse in encouraging people to take up sports ..i mean sports allows u to push your body to the limits or sometimes beyond it . It trains the mind to be stronger than the flesh...and if you take the time to jog or doing sports except for swimming, u can actually sing in the spirit as you along,,speak in tongues,..pray or just meditate on Project Romans's memory verse ..you are actually training both your mind and your spirit to push your flesh to do the things that it don't wants to do. Get it so far.?  With the spirit and minds being stronger...therefore things like quiet time...spending time with God in solitude and silence would have no more hitches..as your mind and spirit will instruct the body to do so. And u can enjoy the fresh air and build up your body....Exercise gives u more endorphin ...a right hormone to make u happy naturally...  I , therefore would like to make a short term commitment to go exercise and really implements all of this...and well cultivate it long enough for it to become a habit...so if anyone wanted to do this with me...feel free to contact me...transport would be no problem. So no excuses for me not do Project Romans as well.  All these revelation is not new...as i only find out during exericse...it gives u so much time to ponder and think .  There is also gonna be 7 creeds to my life for this year that i will obey and hold unto ..which is listed under the seven nevers...which i haven't had time yet to publish it ...maybe by tomorrow.  Yeah for Pure JOy people, there 's gonna be house visitation to Winnie and Jeevan's house ..so meet up in Emillia's place at 8  For Simply United ppl, there's gonna be a mini concert Make Your Mark this friday...I will send u guys soon an email about it.  That's all for now...ohh..there's a backup coming soon... so gtg now  Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan

      4th day and no angpow coming to my way. :(  yet...but it is still good coming back to KL and definitely to church and met up with old frens from Melbourne and of course, who can stand long to be away from SIBKL people...they simply emanates the sweet presence of God everywhere they go.  Had lunch before going to work..(yes working on SUndays as well) with Pure Joy people...can't see any Simply United ppl to have lunch with except well Siew Ching ,,but she 's not free for lunch so took a raincheck... Had a good time with Pure Joy ppl and yes more angpows coming my way soon as me and Pure jOy gang go visit my cell leader's house..yes it Jeevan And Winnie.hehehe  For Simply United ppl, hmm,...awesome work on the GRafitti Board..must say i am indeed impressed and proud of it...what with a comical additional KenPunya..logo there courteosy of Ken Hiew's advertisement. and of COurse Sheep United's seven sheep bowing before the star with their butt right into our face.  Yeah if u guys have come back from your hometown, well i guess we could have a meal together and we (wai nyan and me..if possibly Jamie) can take u to a serene, quiet..tropical place where you have a small pond with waterfall and quiet breeze.., where you can really CHILL or just chill with us and bonds.  For Wan Phing and Erin, well 2 bad..you gotta go soon..but we will make time to send u off.  For my new hobby, going to forums and just pointing out my view...very evident with a wide range of Chickens nicck in Issues , Issues, in Wai Nyan 's Life Legalities.

      Okay i shall soon stop blogging about how each and everyone of us holds a missing link to each other and therefore able to form a bigger picture that God have painted for us.  Previously i talked about Ken, well suprisingly I thought about it and hey this is what i experienced so far. 1) Ken holds the missing links where he will enabled me to get in touch wif my best frens in ministry and school. Andrew Yeow, Kevin Goh.    Some of my cell members like Jenniffer Lee and church mate Andrea also links to this community. 2) David Tan Whay Hun, enables me to know James Chew and his Fellow Penangnites,..like Kenny, Clinton, Sabrina, Angela . 3) Wai Nyan enables me to get in touch with Jonathan Chua..erm..Ps.. 4) Janice Chin, currently a youth worker with Basel KK, gets me to know back Tjer-hann,  5) Le Churn with Michelle, Jessie Teh, Bernard Janz, Hung Teong and Warren Wong. and etc..etc..  Yeah it just shows that God is indeed one that plans your plans...  I got to get in touch with another friend who have shapped my live . This fren is my best fren from primary all the way to college...being the influencing factor in me accepthing Christ...who taught me guitar...who helped me to serve in CF in Nilai...joining church together... After 5 years...of not seeing one another...when i heard of his name, i longed to see this dear fren of mine and to find out whether is he still on fire for the Lord.  A lot of frens that have been on fire with me , have their fires extinguished because work, life problems, their own needs, their integrity got in their way and dismissed their passion in Christ Jesus. I have this desire to get to know them again, encouraged them with my live , with God's word and wanted so much to see them light the fire again and do great things for God.,  My passion is this...Btw, Passion OF Christ, a film that is both funded and directed by Mel Gibson, the most controversial movie movie that chooses to deny the modern teachings of Catholics and Jewish, but chooses to get the source directly from the Bible have been released.  Hopefully can get a pirated copy here in Malaysia, cause there is no way it can come to Malaysia uncensored .or censored.

      Few minutes ago, God's presence just arose and fell unto the Dinner table...and His Healing Hands is just upon us. I am gonna share this experience now...with u guys.  It was at the table...when my mom talks about our past failures...and how each and everyone have learned our mistakes...and when the finger starts pointing...around...and later it was pointed at me...blames, hurts , condemnation, persecution on my own life. I am the eldest in the family and therefore how i live my life have been the main example where my bros and sis would follow. I was on the way back ...from KL to Ipoh and I borrowed RM10 from my bro to pay the toll..cause i spend quite a lot of money on petrol and car maintainence. My bro took it differently as me charging him for the trip. Another fren was there but i choose not to charge him...cause well a cell member and a good fren, i am willing to pay for him.  My mom pressured me the whole day about it and condemn me .for charging the bro and not the fren..you should not charge your brother about anything. I said that i would give back soon. Then at the dinner table...I was again pressured and persecuted...but this time by my bros and sis about the company i am hanging out , majority the cell members,, churchmates and frens. I have over the last few postings...saying that God have really provided me frens of integrity and of good attitudes. Then they start banging on you all about their integrity and that 's where argument ensued... In the end all of the blame falls back on me...even my bros and sis bad attitudes,,the failures..., I am as a big bro have to take full responsibility and I have to take full blame.  I just stood there...receiving with the full grace...knowing all this God's plan is to built me up. I told my mom..let's bygone be bygone....That time..i settled every debts emotional and monetary with my bros and sis ...and yet my mom is nagging about and dwelling about it ...the whole time.  I calmly , told my mom, that yes i have went thru some of the biggest mistakes, failures and hardships, but I believe God have provided each and everyone of us a second chance...a hope....Then Christianity topics was condemned and stepped upon. This whole incident, I don't blame them..I knows a lot of it are my own mistakes..and I humbly accepted it all ...cause i deserved it.But when Jesus was stepped upon and how every Christian is condemned because of several bad eggs...that i cannot stand...I rebuke them straight that they can talk and blame me..persecuted.but they cannot blame or talk bad about Jesus .  I told my family that because of several bad eggs, you can't blame God...on all this...Instead don't dwell on the mistakes of others...don't dwell on our own either...but learn from...and move on. I quoted Forgetting What Lies Behind but Strive for what is in front. I rebuke them straight on with full fury ,,that my live i can be persecuted..or condemned or blamed..but not God..  The minute i finished, i broke down in tears in front of them and explaining that everyone God have us a second chance...not just me ...but everyone in the family. Instead of blaming one another, we should forgive our past sins...and move on...God's presence is so strong that time..i broke in tears...and yet i am comforted and assured..that healing is taking place in my family.  I confessed my past mistakes and have taken full responsibilities and have said sorry to each family member...and yet warning them not to curse on God...because God is the one who have taken my past failures,mistakes and hurts in life to change me to who i am today...not perfect...but close..  At that time, everyone grew silent and nothing was said...and everyone started to calm down....  I believe God 's presence and His healing hand is upon my family and even as i am amazed at How God enabled me to speak His Words  thru my life and thru who i am today...In the family I am  viewed as a fanatic..but I seen myself as just a vessel for God to work ..nothing more..  I will continue to be persistent to share God's principles that i have instilled in my own life and share with it.  So Praise God for all that's happen and truly the Work have been prepared ...God is just watching the results come to pass...  So if ur family have the same situation in this CNY, Start the year rite...ask your family for forgiveness and share God's principles...and His Spirit with everyone in ur family...and believe it God is already here and Miracles, healings and Whole lot more will take place. if only you take your first step.

      Indeed that proves the point made earlier in the posting, that I have taken a peek at what God have in store . Everything is not a coincidence...just a set of plans God have planned that have fall into place...  I have come back to Ipoh to realize that several people i met today have got to know the Lord....yeah a family that is very close to my dad's heart....aka Mr Foong..and family. I guess my joy came when i met one of the family member whom i have known as Jennifer...and her husband...mr foong junior...well have come to know the Lord and have been baptisized...The thing is that Ken Hiew, one of Pure Joy cell members who also have come from Ipoh, knows this family quite well .  Usual Chinese New year to this family is quite bored but most of the time, the motivating factor is that good and "exotic" food is there. But this time around Jesus became the main topic among us "Christians" which makes a good time for the Lord...Wherever you are Praise the Lord ...clap and say Praise God.  Certainly another couple come to know the Lord coz families in Ipoh are usually very bounded to old tradition, feng sui, supernatural stuff....and that is not wrong...they are just barking up the wrong tree..Most of them displayed a hunger for God's presence in their lives.  So people , even as u are in ur respective hometown, start praying for the ppl u met...share ur testimonies...how u deal with life...more importantly how you allowed God to deal with ur life...and what are the results... you don't have to show much scriptures...show your life...just like John 1:1  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.  Live your life according to the word...and ur life will show God...  remember this to Connect, Relate and Resonate The Faith of Jesus Christ  Joshua Tan Fellow Jesus Freaks.

      Definitely one of my best title for a blog in this year.  The Boyz of Simply United...Me, Wai Nyan and Jamie and of Course God, The Father and the Holy Spirit had a nite out yesterday just having dinner and really had a good discussion on controversial topics or someone say taboo subjects. We hanged out in Damansara Utama , havin Steven Western Food Corner where one of the best chicken chop around.  Indeed God is in the midst of us, as we catch up on each other's lives..talks about our blog and it was good. In one of the discussion wai nyan talked about the ppl in his college and there was this girl that Erin introduced to him that was also from ATC Kemanyan , was attending Hope of God KL...which is my old church and yet another guy,,..that Wai Nyan met who he highly regarded as big taiko. JOnathan Chua was his name and he attends Hope of God KL too.  That name strucks back memories and struck a chord in my heart. One of my heart desire since i left Hope Nilai and went to KL for studies in Help Institute would be able to meet up with everyone from Hope church hoping to encourage them and get to know how they are.   Jonathan Chua is currently Wai Nyan's taiko, one of the nicest guy that Wai Nyan met up with , when he entered into this college. Jonathan Chua to me is Ps Jonathan Chua, cause he used to be my pastor in Hope Serdang, one of the most influencial man God have placed him into my life to build strong foundations and attitudes towards God . Ps Jonathan is actually my grand sheperd along with sheep mate is Keith Tay Wen Chang, another sheep who have rub off the annointing that Jonathan Chua have, currently serving in City Harvest Outreach Malaysia with Ps Kevin Loo. Keith Tay founded the church with Ps Kevin Loo , which church grew to about 200 over people in less than 2 years time.  Jonathan Chua, if u reading this blog...i truly Praise God that God have decided the time for us to meet again. I just want to praise God for you...for all that happens. To let u know that I am now serving in the  COUZ (College United Zone) in SIBKL for almost 3 years. The foundations and attitude is built strongly upon your teachings and the attitudes shown by God thru you all this time.  Indeed God is in Control and God Unites ...everyone I have met seems to hold a missing link to meet someone i knew and I believe God 's awesome power and might. Truly He is God over all our lives.  This year church 's theme is Influencing The Nation and it comes from the vision statement of the church Inspired By God, Influencing Nations , Impacting Generations.  and even in this posting I have touched on Influencing the Nations,....and on a more personal level, who have influenced you in your lives,...Who have God have planned and sent that person to influence you to who you are...it can be your pastor, your mentor, your dad...it also can mean a lot of people.  But whoever it is , start to thank them and if u have hurts or unforgiveness...let it go ... Ask God for the influencing factor so that you can be the person that God will sent to influence to your frens and family.  Connect , Relate , Resonate The Faith of Jesus Christ.

      It 's time to get back upon focus..after much "distractions" in life ..to really know that God is in control and  well this year is truly all about Jesus .  Last nite Ps Chew talks about silence and solitude..a powerful message which talks about quiet time with the Lord. Most of us are born into a world of noise and in this time of age, after work ..some of us would use noise as a comforter and assurance .   Quiet Time is indeed a time where you spend time with God...Many a times we spend time alone in silence but not with God but to contemplate our problems and our wishes...alone....  Loneliness does not equate with solitude..Solitude means spending time alone ..with God. To focus on Him , to deny ourself and give our rightful energy, love and focus unto God...praising, worshipping and thanking Him for who He is ...the I am.  I just get back into focus...even as I have chose to distract myself away from God and the end result, I am more confused , lost and am clueless on what steps to take .... Indeed spending with God is not easy to start of with and of course must be made in to habit and a culture to really make it happen. But God's presence is worth all the effort i will make ...  I have plans now to spend time with God in solitude but not in silence due to the nature of my working place. I have decided to use my "extra" time in office with God...thought i cannot praise and worship God in a more personal way but i guess it is a good way to really bring His presence to the office.   Right now i am redoing Experiencing God study in my workplace and yeah for my personal study  i am also doing Purpose Driven Life..  I am not just commiting myself only to the reading of God's word but also to prayer...which i am planning to attend prayer meeting as well to seek after God's presence and to learn more about prayer. So if u guys reading this wants to go ..it is on tuesday 8.00pm..Wai Nyan, Jamie and the rest , if u want to come , please do not be hesistant to call me...if i am not working...i will come and fetch u guys.   Today i have learned about God Centeredness and self-centeredness...which makes me realize that all this time have been blogging about myself...personally..and not about God ... Truly my life is to worship Him and to enjoy Him...as my friend , Father and God.   Accountability Partners..u know of my needs and truly in turn i will pray for 2 of u guys/gals...and truly i hope both of you  will join me as well in this road.

Continue to dream and pray in faith that all thing works for good for those who loved Him. ..  God have indeed brought me a long way and more than i could hope for or dream of...a good job with good career advancement ...with good employers and fanstastic teammates...good cell (Pure JOy and Simply united) , best of the best frens, self adopted families..(wai nyan's and pastor chew) , fanstastic leaders  and most of all awesome church to serve in .  Simply Put it ...Just Jesus.    Ok...put thing on the right track...just previously i have posted a guide for the bloggers of malaysia...I hope u will capture what and who our blogs can capture the attention and impact because our blogs are open to the people,...  OK for now..i'll blog later.  Regards from Fellow JesusFreaks Joshua Tan Connect, Relate and Resonate JOshua Tan

      Today just want to let u guys who doesn't blog and bloggers alike, what is the blogger scene in Malaysia.? Many of you guys  thought that blogging is just for some people who have lots of time and nothing to do or yeah the US people are really doing the blogging.  Some of the well known bloggers of malaysia are 1) Mum-Mum.blogspot.com / www.mum-mum.com/blog , a Kuching women, whose blogs is similar to a MakanSutra. Food reviewers of sorts. 2) JeffOoi.com , his well visited photoblogs and screenshots...issues which happens in Malaysia.  A Patriot's blog. 3) www.petalingstreet.org = a site which compiles blogs from people from all walks of life in Malaysia. 4) nizamzakaria.diaryland.com  Blogging have become more than a trend . In fact blogging have taken a whole different meaning and that means influence . Some of the blogs which i eventually will add in links have influence people in a lot aspects of life and Below i have included a well known blogger in the blogger scene in Malaysia whose blogs are visited by millions of Malaysians local and abroad... Jeffooi.com. Jeff Ooi 's blogs have several aspects which are i-witness...which have blogs in the IT scene as well as Screenshots...the popular blogs where each forum have almost 100 replies...that touches on the latest issues in Malaysia political and non political.  Screenshots is affiliated with MalaysiaKini...a site which is the opposition party site famous for controversial issues in the political arena.   am a big fan of Screenshots. Now, that's a blog I just couldn't miss. It's constantly updated to a point that it looks different every time I click into it. Jeff Ooi is the creator of Screenshots, one of the most visited blog in Malaysia.    For any of you who are not familiar with screenshots, chances are, you are probably not familiar with Malaysiakini.com, an online news portal where Screenshots is affiliated.    One of the reasons why I find Screenshots very fascinating is Jeff's stand on issues that he believes in. It can be rather idiosyncratic at times, but isn't that what blogging is all about?    It is indeed a pleasure for me to read Screenshots, for it saves my time rummaging through a myriad of news portal available out there. What Jeff does almost every day is to consolidate articles/news from all over the net and include a commentary and also not forgetting the links to the article/news original source. This, I believe is the right way to blog. I know there will be folks out there who'll disagree with me, but I still hold on to the believe that a good blog should include: 'commentary + links + extracts' (this is a blogging formula I took from Oon Yeoh's interview  Here's Jeff's e-mail interview. I hope that this interview will be a guide to all of you here who hopes to create a blog of your own:     NZ: Jeff, please introduce yourself to our readers. Like, you can start by telling us where you were born and you alma mater perhaps...    Jeff: I was born and raised in Kedah, then the family migrated to Butterworth after I finished my secondary school education. I have a BA Hons from USM, with major subject in comparative literature and minor in political science. My MBA is from RMIT University Melbourne, specializing in International Management.   I have worked as an advertising copywriter, Later, I moved on to the Client side, in sales and marketing for a US-American pharmaceutical group.    I began to dabble in IT-enabled businesses since 1995 and made a career switch to e-business solutions in 1997.   That was about the time I burnt my fingers in the share market. Pure greed was it.    NZ: In your opinion, what is a Weblog?    Jeff: From the "Form" standpoint, it's a medium for self-publishing on the web. Not much different from the Class-of-94 GeoCities personal websites. Just that the evolving technologies in nano-publishing has made it idiot-proof. Anybody can do a blog now. It has become more or less a DIY.    But if we take note of the fact that Internet has changed drastically in the last 10 years, then blog, as a new form of web publishing has to project its difference.    For example. In 2000, VeriSign was only handling about 600 million domain name enquiries per day. It now handles 9 billion enquiries per day. Three years ago, Google was handling about 100 million searches per day. It has since doubled.   So, the Internet eco-system has bloated, activities have increased manifolds.    The e-space is bigger now, so is the capacity to experiment with new things and experiences.   So, for a weblog to be meaningful and taken seriously, it has to project a difference in "Substance". This substance lies in the requisite that a blog must have embedded links, The bloated Internet eco-system had made embedded links so much easier with a bounty of URLs to link to. It joins the little, little blogs together for cross-referencing. Our knowledge is enriched.   So, in a nutshell, I agree fully with what Aizuddin, Najah and Oon Yeoh has repeatedly said: A blog should be an online content site managed by an individuals, or a group of individuals, that has a niche of focus, or multiple focuses, that target a specific audience. It has to be updated daily, and there must be interactive mechanisms like TrackBack, commentary/forum to bridge the transmitter and its recipients.   I admire Dan Gillmor for saying that a good blogger must have the capacity to put context to issues and events, and trigger some nuances if needs be.    I always consider life as a Rashomon (that Akutagawa short-story filmed by Akira Kurosawa) that depicts many layers of truth and untruth in life. By putting context and nuances to our blog topics is a means to jolt the readers' mind that, "Hey look! Watch my lips, don't just believe what you hear!"   That makes the difference in "Substance". I call that "pushing the envelope further" in the e-space.    In my case, I normally tend to give a signature attitude to my blog entries. Very idiosyncratic I must say.    NZ: What do you see the trend amongst Malaysian bloggers, if any?   Jeff: Aizuddin and the gang have taken the lead to aggregate the fragments of blogs in Malaysia onto a common interface that each can now see, and each can now learn from one another.    I think, we are experimenting with blogs right now, trying from various and different approaches in content creation. If this growth is organically sustained, we will create a critical mass of nano-publishers.    Soon, if we can move a step further by elevating ourselves in terms of "readability" by way of very engaging content, oh man… the envelope will be pushed even further.   NZ: Can you list a few notable Malaysian bloggers that you might find interesting? And please explain why you like their blogs so much.    Jeff: I like blogs that focus on media, public governance, IT and esoteric stuff that appeal to me smacked-on-my-face.   For media-centric blogs, I tend to look for bloggers who dare to make himself/herself visible. Stand out and be counted. This is an issue of ethics and credibility.    Talking about credibility for weblogs, the ideal position is for the blogger to make known his identity. AFAIK, there's only Salam Pax who is anonymous and yet readers trust him. Being a gay in a land called Iraq, he is a high-risk target if he didn't mask himself with the pseudonym. But that's more an exception than the norm. When we are open and identifiable, we bloggers will command respect and credibility for what we say.    If you were to give your two sen's worth on an issue or a particular topic, or take a strong position against a personality's opinion, you must be prepared to stand up there, ready to be challenged intellectually.    You can't just baling batu, sembunyi tangan. That lacks courage.   If you are out-argued, then own up and eat humble pie. Let the better argument win the day. Whether one is right or wrong in taking a stand is not important to me. But the quality of argument, the passion to articulate one's ideas and perspective must be allowed to thrive.    On that basis, I admire Oon Yeoh, my sparring partner on current issues, offline. He stood up for being Pro-US during the Iraqi Invasion. He argued very well facing the crowd in his chosen space, never behind masks and nicks so common in Internet.   I also admire Aisehman. People criticized him for hiding behind a pseudo-name, but I can bear with that, as I understand the kind of "circumstantial burden" and professional hazards he has to bear to give us good blogs like his.   I also admire Najah Nasseri for her passion and depth of thoughts in every of her blogs. She writes good English. She has a blogger personality that spells poise and finesse.    The same thing I must say about Nik Nadzmi Nik Ahmad who is London-based. He has a strong attitude that girdles all his postings. His worldview is quite different from ours. We need more people like Najah and Nik.   For esoteric, I like Odds and Ends' photoblog. It's so cleverly done, using pictures to convey one's observation about things. Along the same line, I also like sixthseal's blog for being against-the-grain. It seems to me that he tries to send out some kind of messages beneath his visual-texts, which are rather engaging.   NZ: Can you estimate how many Malaysian bloggers we have out there? Do you think we are a bunch of avid bloggers?    Jeff: I can't really figure out how many we have now. I think we will just let it grow organically. Some will come, some will fade away.    Aiz, your Petaling Street Project is critical to making this growth exponential.   NZ: Are there differences around the world in the way people Blog?    Jeff: Yes, it's blogs that focus on the dynamics of knowledge and information society that gain recognition and following. Things happen at a break-neck speed, they arouse swift responses across the world.    There are also other layers above blogs where communities become interlaced and interfaced. The US invasion of Iraq, for example, has allowed blogs to mutate into warblogs. The whole world is forced into a conflict of ethics and morality.   We in Malaysia tend to lepak a little with our purpose of life. Internet links people, and yet we are so detached in what we blog.   I talk like a Zen sifu, don't I? (PR sikit, nanti kena sembelih, susah…)   NZ: Do you think in general Bloggers are dying for lots of people to read their content, or are they just finding an outlet for themselves only?    Jeff: Yes, a good blogger must first have this passion of "syiok sendiri syndrome". That drives him/her to blog everyday. It's perfectly OK, if they intended their blogs as just personal diaries.    But, sooner or later, they need to start interacting and interfacing with an audience. Or else they will burn out.   I just wonder, is there a need and purpose to expose your personal diary if you don't intend to have an audience?   NZ: To you, what is the definition of a good blog?    Jeff: Oh, must I repeat? A blogger defines a good blog. Choose a focus, or multi-focuses, have an audience in mind, update daily, have embedded links, have interactive mechanism to engage your audience on what your blog, always give a context to the Rashomon in life, arouse nuances and conflicts if you need, lace your blog with your signature attitude.   But try to have an open mind. I know this is hard even for many of us, including myself. But ideas are like parachute. It only works when it's open.   NZ: Would you agree that Weblogs have increased the masses of content out there? But there are so many contents out there, so how does one differentiate between relevant contents and the ones that shouldn't be published in the first place?    Jeff: I think a blogger's chosen genre will determine this. You need to decide the purpose of blogging in the first place. It takes up your time; you have to reply to emails and argumentative overtures. It zaps your energy.   If there's no sense of purpose in blogging, you are averse to the bothersome question of what content to blog. Having relevant content simply doesn't arise if we don't have a purpose.   Generally, I think weblogs are still early days in Malaysia as far as leaving lingering impact on Malaysians' psyche is concerned.   NZ: In your opinion, what sorts of folks normally start up blog projects?    Jeff: Two extremes. One, those who want to be seen. Two, those who want to be heard.   NZ: What are the advantages of communicating by blog?    Jeff: It's addictive to the blogger, it's contagious to the readers. And the cycles go. Do this incessantly, and you will move mountains as far as influencing public opinion is concerned.   NZ: Can you tell us how you got started with your own blog project?    Jeff: I learned about weblog as a self-publishing tool in 2001 from Oon Yeoh's column in The Sun. He was toying with the idea of having blogs for his SunCities project. But the project was abandoned, overtaken by events.   I started two blogs in 2002. One was to co-blog with a family member who is studying in Melbourne, to keep in close touch as we miss her so much. The other is using Blogger.com to archive my research materials as URLs expire all too soon.   I decided to go public with another blog, Screenshots that focus on governance issues in the local media, international policies, IT and local politics. You know how fed up I have been with those idiots monkeying around in the press, in the government, in the so-called national pinnacles in IT policy development.    More importantly, I wish to see a tidal wave of bloggers to come out taking on these monkeys. We can't let them fool us around if K-generation were to mean anything at all. No point talking about it. Do it!   NZ: What is your blog's mission?    Jeff: To produce more bloggers. More Oon Yeohs. More Dinesh Nairs. More Aizuddins. More bloggers.   NZ: Your seem to be enjoying your writing your blog. Your blog, Screenshots, are filled with so much information sometimes I wonder where you find the time to scour all the information listed in your blog. It can't be money, because they are all written for free. So, what motivates you to work on your blog?    Jeff: I wish I could make money out of blogging.    No, it's more a crusade to produce more bloggers. Lone voices don't get heard. We need to aggregate our voice in a loud thunder. Rebecca Blood says, let the thousand flowers bloom.   Probably the always-on Broadband environment at home and at work does help. I read a lot in between meetings, travels, and meals. I am practically a news junkie. And I write fast.   And one more luxury is that there are many readers who emailed me pointers and blog ideas. They include senior editors, government officers and the nameless whose stories can be verified. They are great collaborators.   NZ: Have Screenshots developed in the way you expected? Did you allow yourselves any expectations?    Jeff: I do not know for sure. But through this blog, I managed to know many people who care to share their observations in private. Many of us are seriously concerned with the fact that Malaysia has every opportunity to be a great country.    But we just screwed it up in so many things. Again and again. That really sucks. It's frustrating.   NZ: What is the most challenging aspect of managing Screenshots?    Jeff: Time wasted on people who attack the Messenger, rather than tackling the issues presented in the blogs. At first, I tried to engage them with a rational approach. But I have become wiser. I let my attitude take charge. That I will be fair, but I will be firm in my stand on things I detest.   That, however, zaps away my free time EVERY DAY!   NZ: What was your most embarrassing blog moment?    Jeff: I loud-mouthed by making claims like "Thinking Allowed, Thinking Aloud". Then, I had to eat my words, close the Comment feature, reopened it, then moderate it.   I don't enjoy it at all. I just want to blog.   NZ: I have this feeling that you have thousands of visitors per day, especially when your blog is linked with Malaysiakini.com. So tell me, how many hits do you have so far... how many hits do you have per day? Can you give us some indication of the growth of user numbers over time?    Jeff: I rely on Sitemeter free service for the time being. On weekdays, I have a steady count of 850 visitors and about 1,300 page views. It dropped to 450 visitors and 750 page views on Saturdays and Sundays.   Major referral sites are from Malaysiakini and USJ.com.my, and Google. Traffic from Malaysia accounts for about 53%, while US, Australia and UK take up about 35% in total. The rest are "dan lain-lain".    I haven't have time to run my server log to Webtrend the data.   NZ: Honestly Jeff, had any negative experiences because of your blog?    Jeff: I received many hate mails and virus mailbombs.   NZ: Weblogs are considered as - 'Journalism's New Life Forms' by some. Do you think that Weblogs represent a new model of journalism that threatens to render many journalists obsolete?    Jeff: It will complement mainstream journalism, but I doubt it can ever replace it. Mainstream media runs news that are verified and authenticated. Bloggers can run away with murder by simply rant and rant.   This is where I try to experiment. I don't and have never worked in media. So, if I put media folks to critical examination, how much can I push the envelope to get a good Press?   But I don't think local media have the guts to start a blog in their official news pages like what MSNBC, BBC and Guardian did.   NZ: Should there be any comparison made to traditional media at all?    Jeff: Yes, blogs win hands down in speed and cross-linking. It's viral and contagious. There is serious latency in the dead-tree version.   NZ: Do you think that Weblogs are just fads... that it will fade and die out one day?   Jeff: Yes, blog will go away, to be replaced by a newer form of online content.   To me, weblog is not the final discovery in Internet.

      The Fellowship of the Blogs , an idea concocted by several lame bloggers which include me and wai nyan ...while chomping away at E03 appreciation dinner...on a lamb chop bathing in the mint sauces.. Because we were talking about how most Simply United Cell members except for Yun Hann, Siew Ching and Erin and of course Daniel.., have their blogs ..why not united these blogs together under one Blog. Simply United's blog aka Lord of the Blogs...and under it the Fellowship of the Blogs..which happens to be us. Yeah i know the name is lame...but it is kinda cool looking at it...the idea itself.  Siew Ching, of course a frequent visitor of our blogs , should of course..start her own blogs and of course Erin as well cause she got so much to share ...  The point of it all is that we have a unique culture in Simply United which is very different from the rest of the cells found in Simply United...the most unique of all have alredi been highlighted. Simply United have an online community where we all can find out about one another and encourage one another thru our blogs as well as the frequent readers.   So Keep it up..

      Truly these pictures which i have compiled from the previous shootings that i did in E03 bring memories of how God have used E03 to impact hundreds of lives that are now empowered for God. and in my previous posting...E05 is not too far away..so those who have not been there ...well it is time to save up time and money for the life changing moment.  For those who have been there...well u are also welcome but not as delegate but as facilitator...I challenged to those who have been empowered to Connect, Relate and Resonate..Opps my personal vision statement.. to those who have not truly experienced God's power and promises for them.  The Community project needed more facilitator as they expands the area they are reaching more to the community around Klang valley...So guys , those E03 delegates prepare yourself this year, as you go out and touch the community around you and blessing your pastors in your home churches.  The pictures are found in the  Kayanbutter photo collection viewer. Take patience as some of these picture which involves lots of people takes time to load...also i have retained some of the pictures resolution so that you can print these pictures out.  Truly after you have seen the photos...you will soon realize that God is at work...kinda like the first Realities of Experiencing God...  Regards From Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan

      Yes it is by Bilbo Baggins...but juz my posting .  E03 dinner appreciation have been fanstastic to hear so much good news from team leaders and even a small role player like me ...well encouraged.. The huge amount of food that is available..and yeah Ice Kacang..so much Ice Kacang...and of course the video ...of what have happened particularly the champion of the week and the funny advertisement by Chee Siong...SIB homegrown Austin Power...with his funny antics of a Kit Kat and Snicker's advertisement as well as advertisement to Ps Nick Resce 's church...thrown us off the table laughing... Really the reports of E03 of how God have used this to start a generation that will will really impact this generation. There is a bunch of delegates from Teluk Intan who came for E03 aged around teens, went back to their hometown and started their own mini concerts featuring the Power album...and start to minister to people. A lot of pastors and ministry leaders reports of how their youth have been deeply impacted as they went back into their own churches and really blesses their pastors. Truly the planning committee have started to build upon what God have instilled in their hearts and that is backed by popular demands...E05...yes E05 is gonna come back with a bigger bang than before...  Jayne Wong, one of our creative art facilitator challenged us , that those who have went for E03 will come back to E05 as a facilitator...not just the ministry leaders but the participants from E03 themselves...since they are empowered so..they are gonna go back to E05 to impact others...  This year is a year of preparation for the collegezone to move forward as a Joshua Generation to start conquering and start claiming God promises not just on our own lives but lives that will be impact this year...as well..a call to disciple other people....  A year of victory and a year of impact...so exciting..  Regards from Fellow JesusFreak Joshua Tan

      Indeed just had a good time with Daniel, planning for Simply United ..even i found out that hey this title is  our current College's vision...how prophetic can that be... Indeed all the time we have been living with the deliverer mentality and living our lives like that but it is time to go to the enemy's camp and take back what is ours. It is time for us to live lives that are of victorious mindset. With that , we can start to IMPACT THE NATIONS...SIBKL 's vision for this year. Oh yeah if you guys read this tonite, well we are the greeters for SIBKL second service tomorrow at 8.00am ..which by the ways means ...i have to go to church just after work...so if u see me yawning , don't ask why..heheh  Right , if u guys that are reading this but not attending the cell, well my invitation to you with open arms to come attend cell. BTW , we are not going to have cell this friday but i am sort of thinking something out so that we will have something to keep us occupied. See u in church then.

      Simply United, what a wonderful name, ain't no passing craze.  The new year have come again and it is time to start the year right with the Lord as it is a new year for new beginnings , a year to glorify the Lord.  For those people who are leaving soon , I pray that they will carry that passion to serve the Lord in their respective destination and they will carry that same spirit of champions to their places...to really bless the pastor and the Lord in every way possible.  For those who have feets still firmly planted on Malaysian soil, well we can do better...we pray that people will continue to flood the cell and we are able to rise up to impact the nations. ..This year start right by equipping yourself with the Word...so that you can stand strong with the words and not fall for the world. This year , allow your actions to speak louder than your words...to testify the goodness of the Lord... and if possible use words..  For the leadership of the Simply United, pray for them and support them in every way possible by even start asking your friends to come for cell...start by serving in the cell..if you have an idea for the cell to serve more effectively...bring it out with them. Learn to appreciate them with words and hugs.  I believe God have great plans for Simply United...and i believe God is preparing it already ..so don't be suprised when you heard God calling you to be there to serve..God is always in control  Fellow JesusFreaks

      Today have been a productive public holiday ever but have been strenous on the temple of the Holy Spirit.  Woke up at 6 am to jog with the Au Yong bro as usual except that i have not been doing this for the past few days and this routine have to be initiated again .Just as we are retiring saw this huge group of CLC people having family day in Bukit Kiara and later met Angela and James... they (Sheep United) are having a time of their own to jog albeit late a bit cause they jog at 8 where today is a public holiday so Bukit Kiara is congested with not the usual people.  Then at 11.30am , I joined the Pure Joy people(Ken , Mel and Kyron) to meet up with Ps Lindy and 1800 united and John Chew to go for wall climbing which is awesome because I for the first time have to take a basic course on how to scale the wall and how to belayer someone. It was a really a sport that i can managed quite well...very intensive on the physical and mentally because it challenged ur mind to think when you are tired to chart our route along the handgrips and footholds..to get to the top.  Had a really good time hanging out kyron and well Melissa Wong...get to know her just a little closer and found out how good she is at this as well. Ken Hiew as usual provides the pure joy and of course made the whole outing today fun. To see the whole thing works out with other cell as well, i am challenged to bring SImply United to have fun in cells especially in the area of wall climbing . To hear from Wai Ping my cell leader Daniel so cham staying back at his house unaware of the whole outing trips tickles me a little...cause Daniel have been voting each year for Simply United to go wall climbing but each time was voted out. To think that this year , his cell member would have gone with other cell for wall climbing and not invite him , is quite a big dissapointment.   Sorry i don't have pictures cause i did not bring my digi cam there...if not the pics there would be fanstastic. but of course this whole outing guarantees me a second trip to further improve myself in all this.and really strengthen my body for all this...I just hope that i can remember the knots and the process of belaying someone.  Opps gtg now...i have my current work to do and i am really sleepy cause i did not rest and i went straight to work ...until the next morning 7.00am.

      The first time she came to know us ....she is already at full speed with her enthuasiam , sharing her heart out and really mixing around with people. Furthermore she is encouraged by Case Chong , her childhood fren that brought her to Simply United. She came from a Christian family that doesn't think christianity as very important and a lot of other cultures are practised such as tarot cards , fortune telling and a lot of new age stuff mixed into it and u get Erin. But besides that her enthuasiasm, her faithfulness to friends and the change that God have brought to her life have impacted me in a huge way.  Looking at this pics will tell u what joy and honour to know this sis of ours..(Simply United) .       She is now tonite going off to Queensland where she will be studying in University of Queensland to complete her degree in Business and her departure marks another closing of chapter in KL and a new Book to write in OZ..   As her stay here in KL, she have been radically changed girl with God setting her free from her bondage to new age stuff, cleansed her and changed her into a JesusFreak for God...who never compromises anything for God, is determined to do her quiet time no matter what happens. She is joyful, honest and direct with everyone she meets . Isn't afraid to confront any issues that bothers her. In Short she is the friend you would always wished will be there and honest with you..Real Genuine friendship.  Her change for the better, I think have shocked and impacted a lot of people, especially her closest friends and family. She also now provides counselling to people and isn't afraid to put God into the picture and explain to people from the blibical point of view.  I believe God have prepared this woman of God well, have prepared her for the incoming journey of serving God and blessing the people there in OZ...really now to think of it...God is sending off all the wonderful people there to bless the OZ people. In the 70, 80 and 90s, OZ people have  been sending their missionaries and prayer for Malaysia to impact the people there and i think it's high time that we are sending our best people there beginning with Erin and Wan Phing.   So Erin is leaving tonite at 7.30pm  and will be in the airport at 5.pm She currently needed prayer for the journey mercy but most of all she needed prayer in helping her find accomodation cause her potential roomate have rejected her offer and now she have to find a new place for the accomodation. She is currently Praise God staying in her dad's fren's house but I believe God is coming out with a miracle....so Erin if u are reading this...start Praising God and worship Him, Cause your answer is already on its way. Hang on to Him and Have Faith.  Let's pray people for Erin Wong .

                                 Watched an impacting and moving movie, that will strike every chords of my heart and make every Christian values comes alive in this movie...inspired by true story.  I will not tell u guys who is in the cast ..but allow the pics to do it for me.  This is another true story of the values that revolves around football..Yes i like to watch movies that have strong values and it is all instilled in football movies except for the infamous Waterboy which is a crap show.  Remember the Titans, Replacement Players, ..follows the same line as this movie.   This story revolves around a passionate football coach who have started to train and move the town's team into victory and targeting the state finals....Radio, a slow and retarded youth who often pushed his trolley into the town and around the field where Coach Jones is training his boys..Coach befriended James which later is dubbed Radio, simply because James had a passion for radios, which he carries everywherer he goes. Coach Jones helps Radio by allowing him to help out in the football team and later when the season ends, he helps in the basketball team.in school... Through the  years, we get to see how Coach Jones develops a strong relationship with Radio and how Coach Jones fought for him and helped him... The true spirit of discipling is often seen here and Radio exhibits a very kind and forgiving heart that treats everybody the same no matter what they do to him.   A Very Recommended Movie besides Passion.

       Definitely The Movie that I have to get no matter what 's the cost and if malaysians in general get their hands on it by whatever means...i pray that God will impact these people to realize the truth that will set them free .          I believe this year will be a year for the largest group of people in Malaysia to really know the truth and be set free. Church all over Malaysia have to rise up and be ready to receive the influx of people that is gonna come and seek counselling of who Jesus Christ is. So will be my prayer for the entire year of 2004.

      Avalon songs in the background ...reminds me of Everyday is a new day ...a new day , a second chance at how are u gonna live your live and a new way to live it loud.   I have been sort of dried of the Word Of God, partly because Couz Camp arrangements, Young Adults and of course work confirmations. Prepared the entire week just for 5 minutes on the phone with Darlene Kiola..aka Big Mama...of EA Consulting US. But Praise God, by His mercy and grace, I am saved and yeah got thru and confirmed for work. I mean I get a raise not by much and able to take leave...enjoy the benefits of a full time staff...  Yesterday was great, as I am serving together with Pure Joy which gives me satisfaction and rekindle the passion to serve in church as a cell. I am driven by that inner passion to arrange Simply United to serve in the same way ...not just once in a while but to serve consistently. Because faith must come with actions. It was great cause I really learned a lot from Pure Joy...the people with genuine passion with real struggles but equally real desire to please God. Then we had an all guys nite out simply because they are a few girls that turned our offer down..one going to Sydney today and another tired out from work...oh well ..God 's plan.  Then we hanged out in a truly truly awesome place where solitude, silence and serenity with a gentle breeze that blows by just enhanced the moment we share as all guys time...discussing our struggles with BGR...hehehe  But truly I believe that the ultimate love that we hunger for is not just the love of our future spouse..but really to experience more depths in the love of God. God 's love is patient, it is kind. it never boast, it ....as in 1 Corinthian 13. In fact it is uncompromising and it is unconditional.   This morning as i waked up, a new day, a new time, a new purpose and a new way to live out the day for Jesus. I viewed my work as not just work ...but a time to point Jesus to my collegues..a time to serve God and live my life according to His word. There are times when we fall, particularly when i drive can sometimes stumble other...cause i cursed or get even by cornering people  and it does not do justice to the Christian Stickers on my car . Pray for me. Don't get me wrong i am a careful driver and does not speed ..but there are times.occassionally....out of frustration with the traffic or just late for work.  Pray for me as I am currently rising up to God's challenge to coordinate prayer for COUZ camp and i am not your usual holy ..mighty prayer warrior...I am just believing to God for that...and will take my first few step by faith.  Reviews of Joshua Harris will come as i look into the second chapter by next week.

      An impressive impression she made on me when i first met her, she is like an angel of God, with her innocent attitude with a very fast speaking tongue that will zip thru any conversation and left the listener confused and tired ears , trying to capture every syllable and words that she spoke with great efficiency and skills honed from years of speaking with the same way. A girl that is bursting with joy that she can't wait to share with everyone she met or introduced to. Despite her age, she time and time , have shown wisdom that she gathered from her relationship with our Father in heaven.    She never showed any grumpy face , or angry face or anything negative . She serves God in every way possible in AYA ,or campus city or in church with great spunkiness, grace and definitely loads and loads of enthuasiasm that heaven can spare. She is humble to learn everything yet she have the authority to take charge whenever leadership is needed.   In the years i have known her, she have left a great impact in every lifes that she bonded with and yes lives and attitudes changed once i met with her.   She is a wonderful and genuine song writer who writes songs under the impression of the Holy Spirit and have great desire to lead and point people to Jesus. A great friend and a wonderful sister in Christ.  (Her Song : SImply United **playing in the background**)  May I present to you gals and guys, the only nominee in the category of a wonderful friend and sister in christ.   (Drums Rolling)  Ms Tan Wan Phing., the owner of http://www.xanga.com/survigal who is bound for Sydney this Sunday.  You are one the David's mighty women of Simply United and we pray that not only you find new friends and place in Sydney...but you will continue to serve God with that fiery passion of yours and bless the people of Oz there.

      Pagi pagi, ku bukak mataku and terus merujuk kepada telefon bimbit untuk masa and terkejut aku , bila masa yg tertera pada skrin telefon bimbitku = 5.30 pagi... ku terus berlari ke tandas aku untuk menukar pakaianku dlm sekelip mata. ku melintang ke keretaku and terus berlumba ke kediaman saudara Wai Nyan dan Dewgem yg sedang menunggu di awal awal pagi. Selepas tu saya pula bawa kereta dengan selamba menuju ke TTDI Bukit Kiara. Dlm perjalanan, Dewgem, seperti di pagi yang lain , sentiasa bersenyap and cuba seupayanya untuk menutup matanya seketika untuk mengambil masa yg dihilangkan semasa menungguku......  account from Kayanbutter while driving.  As we arrived at that place, we proceeded unto stretching ourselves...with the monkeys by the same common name of AuYong Wai - **** , proceeded to the strecthing pole as well as the monkey bar . Dewgem, seems to be in her standby mode strolled along the path and tried to sleep while standing .  Me? I am just stretching out with no hard effort and accept the reality that i am just overweight and no little stretching would do much good.  But we had a good time with AuYongs leaving me and Dewgem in the dust ..running along the path as though there is a chun chick up for grabs....and me ..well just strolling with a consistent pace , a common technique called walking but improved with faster pace...  Dewgem and I talked a lot on Christian stuff and schools..ministry...speaking in tongues...and did not realize that we have walked 2 rounds...and then we literally bumped into James and suprisingly Angela.. As we waited for Auyong monkeys to come back after their 3 round, we hang out near the lake where terrapins and fishes swam in that murky water which we can hardly see.  It is good to know that our influence in blogs as well as this healthy culture start to spread to particular penangites. to see them in the morning is a miracle and indeed their fellowship are a blessing to our group.  We had breakfast later....and of course..hopefully James would come back and join us in our quest to a healthy lifestyle....  On the next blog, watch out for the review of the 2nd chapter of Not Even A Hint : Ps Joshua Harris. by me  In the meantime go to www.joshharris.com and His Blog as well : joshharris.blogspot.com for more info on the book.  My first impression is "Look no further, Wait no more,..the answer to our common struggle is here"  Lust , masturbation, sexual immorality, pornography, recent rape cases, sexual temptation, homosexuality, sodomy ...you name it all...it is covered in here...  Know your enemy, Identify and relate with it .....Break Free and be victorious over it with Jesus.

      Force myself out of bed by 5.30am MST (malaysian time) and prepare to fetch wai nyan and of course ...our distinguished guest  Dewgem and as well a newcomer in the college united zone, Au Yong Wai Phing in our quest of a more slimmer and more attractive physique as well as irrrestible strength in the Word of God. Fetched them and arrived in Bukit Kiara around 6.05am and went around 3 rounds today.Not bad , as i managed to sweat quite a bit and had a good time with wai phing and dewgem.  When i went back after dropping wai nyan and gang at his new house, i found that there is a package for me from Covenant Life Church from US and i thought what on earth have i done till there is a package for me from US. When i opened the package, and then the book Not Even A Hint from Ps Joshua Harris dropped out . I was thanking God and overjoyed..cause i never thought he would response to my email and yet be able to send that package to me in a few days time....  I have read the first chapter and was hungry for more as profound truth and facts are revealed to me.  This is an answer from God from which i have been expecting for the past 1 year plus as I am struggling with the whole area of Lust along with its companion ..masturbation. There i said it , I have been struggling with that alll these while.. Each time i did that, i begin to set a higher standard and poured in my willpower to resist the next urge to masturbate...to relieve myself from the pressure and temptation. Many a times this issue /battle have been confronted with talks, confessions, accountability groups, prayer, and etc...yet it goes again in a cycle. I am becoming more ashamed to come back to God to asked for his forgiveness for breaking thru his standards...but i chose to hang on.  In his book Future Grace, John Piper said we must fight fire with fire. The fire of the lust's pleasures must be fought with the fire of God 's pleasures. If we fight the fire of lust with prohibitions and threats alone - even the terrible warnings of Jesus - we will fail. We must fight it with the massive promise of superior happiness . We must swallow up the flickers of lust's pleasures in the conflagration of holy satisfaction.  Excerpts from the Not even a hint.  To expect victory over lust , we must believe with our whole heart that God is against our lust not because He is opposed to pleasure but He is so committed to it.  He invented pleasure and intimacy of sexual desire but he doesn't want lust to taint all of this and perverts it .  I would continue to immerse myself with the word of God, spending every moment with Him and coming to Him in prayers even i have masturbated.  I would come to Him by faith and not by guilt or feelings..but to believe that He can deliver all of this away.  Right , this are some of the things i have found out from chapter 1 of Not Even A Hint from Joshua Harris.  So Come Back next time to expect more reviews about the chapters in this book.  Joshua Tan

      A fellow blogger of the Fellowship of the Blogs, once quoted that   "I remember reading in a book about another reason for keeping fit. And I guess this applies to anyone who's praying for a life partner. You know how sometimes we ask God for a partner who loves God and well, attracts you (there should always be that chemistry to start with), the same deals with us because somewhere out there someone is asking God that we be attractive. At least, in their eyes. " Excerpts from Wainyan.mediahulk.com   Well my reasons for running in the early morning have something close to it but yet it is so far from it. I have recently attracted to a girl whose faith is the attractive point...of her...and I am encouraged to even build up that faith will attract people to God. I have and desire to continue to pursue that strengths in the Word and pursue God 's presence by running everyday morning or afternoon.  Early last year, i thanked God for being able to go to OZ for my graduate training and in the process being able to go to Kooroong , one of the mega Christian Bookstore in OZ. Being able to buy a Spirit Filled Bible with cover at equalivency of RM currency of RM 60.00 So i used to the max the bible in helping me to understand ROmans...and for every bible verses that strikes me, i wrote it down in cards and make a point to recite it loudly.  So early in the morning as i go jogging with Wai Nyan , as i run or jog or just walk , sweating..i will recite bible verses that is written earlier on. Even as i do that, i get to proclaim the Word , memorize it and let not the word of God depart from my lips and heart so that i can meditate on it day and nite. so that i might be prosperous.  It was great being able to kill 3 birds with one stone,...able to worship God in exercising physically and spiritually. Run, Pray and Worship.  I will open this invitation to SImply United members, as well fellow bloggers to come and join us. I will continue to cultivate this into my life that it will become an influencing culture and factor . I hope even as we choose to do this..we die to ourselves each day and be able to become the empty vessel for God 's annointing to do its work in us so that we can preach the gospel both to believers and unbelievers.  For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ to Salvation to those who believes, first to the Jews and then to the Greeks. For in the righteousness of God, Christ is revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written , The Just shall live by faith.

      The yawns..the laying back..the eyes closed only but a moment...the dizzying effect...all the symptons are showing it and yet i am living in self denial. Fighting back yawns, eyes squinting to see the text and numbers , that are symbols of companies , transaction and stuff.  Yeah the dreaded night shift , graveyard shift. i am working today and tomorrow night. No matter how long i slept during the day , i have not been able to combat the long hours of non sleep.  Thankfully my partner in this graveyard shift have given me the permission to sleep as he knows and he saw the my swollen eye bags. But even then , i am quite hesistant to sleep during my work and will try every way to stay awake. Every now and then the software reminder of our daily task list , emits a police siren signaling the beginning of a new task....rings and echoes in my ears and my mind , waking me up from a blissful sleep to reality    I am somehow reminded of how hard is it for the disciples to stay awake and pray in the middle of the night before Christ is crucified... The night that they were supposed to be watchful , alert and in prayer. I guess it signifies our attitude even in the end days, that we are watchful for God's return in prayer and aletness.  What's with now..is that this monday...Addressing this to Melissa, Wai Nyan , Siew Ching, Yunn Hann and anyone else in Simply ,. are u guys free on 8pm for dinner together and then later talk .,,,juz talk...  If you are , please email me quick and i will again remind u guys in church tomorrow.

                                                      Currently Reading                  A Practical , Fanstastic Book that you can apply the moment you read up on steps to help ease ur struggle with sexual temptation/   Thankfully enough i am not distracted by other women ..cause I am made to be faithful to one ...though i have someone in mind but then  ...at least it is a good thought to hold unto.  It's been a week plus since i have last blogged and indeed there is something that have happenned that hindered me from blogging. I have from my last entry ..been very dry spiritually and from there that is  where the time of backsliding begins. To many people, backsliding seems like a process that you simply go away from God. But to me...that is also true but most of the time , it is a choice . So from my dry relationship with God , slowly i started to withdraw from people , from God , started to give up my dreams, my passion . It is very easy to do it and later the standards and whatever principles that have been shaping my life, I also have easily let it go and even welcome some of them . Particularly temptations.  I thank God for His continous faithfulness and saw chances / opportunities to work in  instead of seeing me a rebellious and good for nothing sheep that does not requires His Grace which He have died for. I really want to appreciate God for His Holy SPirit continues to prompt me that He have come for the sick and not the healthy . His Grace is forever sufficient for every need and hurt. God's presence continues to linger even when I have sinned and it is like a perfume that will never go away.  Like i Said, I recently had an accident which involves my front section of the car literally smashed by another car . After that my dentures broke and furthermore , my handphone refuses to call or receive call from anyone. and in all this  I have to put off my savings for the guitar and I have to spend all these money to procure. I always encourage people that nothing that happened is a coincidence and God is always in control.  Well guess what , i figured that God is using "His Burning Bush" in modern context to gain my attention to what is important...not the challenges that He have allowed but more importantly my time and relationship with God. So one day i decided to wake myself up from this condemn life that i was leading .  And I decided to turn back towards God one fine day and am willing to face God and my consequences of my actions simply because God's presence in my life is worth fighting for and worth it all to go thru. Though sooner or later , I knew that I have to face my consequences and what the heck ../? But I hold unto to the belief,...yes i will face my consequences , but I also believe God will help me to overcome it all and the overall results a refreshing touch and a new relationship with total dependance will be established.  After even writing this blog , I stood up close my bedroom door, slowly starting to pray in the spirit ...started to pray in strong tongues...and then i started to kneel and really just cried out to God ....and the rest is an experience that words can seems to express..SO i challenged you guys going thru the same things that i went thru just a few days ago , have u decided yet...ultimately it is ur choice that will determine and not allow circumstances to change you.

      In case you are wondering what is the title>? I have just recently read ChristFreek urlLink    's blog and have stumbled on this site which have a list of really funny phrases in Aramaic which is the language of Jesus 's time.  Most of these phrases directly are the feedbacks received when watching Passion Of Christ movie  urlLink      The title meant this: Brilliant! I can't wait for the sequel (second coming)  Some of the comedic feedbacks which are incidentally translated into Aramaic to relate with the movie's language and theme. For those who have watched Passion of Christ, will be able to relate with it and yeah hope it tickles your heart. heheheh  Some of the brilliant ones are as follows  Baseem, ellaa saabar naa d-etstebeeth yateer b-Lebeh d-Gabaaraa!  Not bad, but I think I preferred Braveheart  Aykaa beyt tadkeetha? Zaadeq lee d-asheeg eeday men perdey devshaanaayey haaleyn!  Where is the loo? I need to wash my hands of this popcorn.   Demketh! Udamaa lemath mtaynan b-tash'eetha d-khashey?  I fell asleep! What station of the cross are we up to?   Ktaabaa taab hwaa  meneyh.  It's not as good as the book  Puuee men Preeshey, puuee!  Boo, Pharisees! Boo!   D-tetbuun deyn men yameen u-men semaal, la hwaat deel l-metal, ellaa l-ayleyn da-mtaybaa. To sit at my right or my left is not for me to grant; it is for those to whom it has already been assigned  Eeth lee 'ayney, ellaa layt lee d-ekhzey la-kteebaataa takhtaayaataa. Neqruuv leh?  I have eyes but I cannot see the subtitles. Can we sit closer?   Laa, haw Shem'uun Qooreenaayaa eethaw! Ezdar!  No, that's Simon of Cyrene! Pay attention!   Waay! Haw 'aalmeenaayaa hwaa!  Well, that was eternal  In case there someone out there accuses the movie as Anti Semitism, here is one feedback that will revert it all.  Enaa mqatreg naa l-Ruumaayey. I blame the Romans  Een, Yuudaayaa naa, ellaa b-haw yawmaa laa hweeth ba-mdeetaa.  Yes, I'm Jewish, but I wasn't there that day    We kept some of the best for the last which deserves our best awards to these feedbacks.  Etheeth l-khubeh 'almeenaayaa d-Maaran Yeshu Msheekhaa, ella faasheth metool Moneeqaa Belluushee!  I came for the everlasting love of our Lord Jesus Christ, but I stayed for Monica Bellucci.   Ayleyn enuun Oorqey? Which ones are the Orcs?   Lebba deel daaleq, ellaa teezaa deel daamek. My heart is on fire, but my bum is asleep.   Note: that all this is in the name of fun and pokes fun at the movie and not at the message of the movie or the characters..

      Call upon the name of the Lord and be Saved....  Truly life only start to begin when you called upon the name of Jesus and shall u experience life to the abundance .  Early morning woken up for morning jogs and boy there was huge group of us and then bathed and then go for COLT(CLIT) Core Leader Intern Training in which i have attended for the 5th time and still i can't get enough of it . Of course hanging out with new upcoming leaders of Simply United is a joy ...rather than just hanging out with Siew Ching and Dan all the time...not that i am complaining especially with Siew Ching. Then went to SIB PJ for the 1st time to witness Ivan and Weng Onn for baptism. ANd then went back to church to prepare the team for the launching of   COUZ Camp : Leaving your skins behind ...............with our humongous booth with trees , lights and lots of decoration. Pictures of it i shall add to this blog later cause the pics from this booth rite to the application form is unique ...Incidentally the Application form is also the T-Shirt Design. For RM99 , you get 4 days 3 night in Jungle Lodge which is very cool. T- Shirt as well. We are going to print more T-Shirts as the design is so cool that ppl who planning not to attend also would want to buy one.  For some the question of life does not come to them ...instead the question of sacredness of marriage comes into mind ..as evidenced in Wan Phing 's blog...  urlLink Wan Phing  and the culture sets in OZ, australlia thru a conversation with an old SIB Youth Dinosaur ...who is SIR7  urlLink  SIr7  who actually comes out with interesting stats.  I just received an old frens ' resume to pass on to my company and boy she have an interesting and impressive resume.Imagine at 23 years old, she have a master degree in SOftware Engineering and yeah she is super cool girl....and chun too...hehe./  ahh..the gift of life from God is simply wonderful and the upcoming challenges that is coming...i am both excited and bewildered because i wonder what lesson can i get from all this...

      Passion..what Drives Jesus to die on the cross for us all ?        And when the whole movie ended....with no credits whatsoever ..juz Jesus walking out of the cave with his still nail pierced hands...the audience i was watching with ...went speechless..there was a long moment of silence..as tear ran down my face with me still holding on my hands as though i was the thief that acknowledged Jesus crucified next to Him...  Every time a whip lashed across the body . my heart and spirits cried out in anguish..and pain knowingly that that is for my sins ..whom i sometimes i committed it knowingly and yet in that moment...my spirit shouted out in anguish and in pain. When the scourge was upon Jesus, ripping away pieces of Jesus Body...i truly felt the pain and yet i forced myself to watch it ..because it was the truth... my tears was flowing down ....and whatever Jesus felt , i felt because of my spirit man.  Truly a Deep Impacting because Mel Gibson revealed what was truly on the mind of Jesus referring to the bible when He chose to give Himself away to fulfill His Destiny . The actor truly showed true expression which suggested that Jim ..the actor have fasted for days and prayed so that he can potray Jesus in the most real way.  Rudy said to us all ...when we left the house, Today ..Praise God..There are gonna be 10 changed lives right this very moment..and I , if God willing, would like to changed ppl's lives just by inviting them to watch the movie.  And for all Christian out there, a movie that is not mourning about Jesus's death, but a movie celebrating Jesus's death and His victory over sin ...not any other movie..but a movie that will change lives..the moment you watched it.  It would be ideal , if you guys can get an original DVD but in a country like this, pirated one will also do according to your own standing and conscience...don't watch it like you watch other movie...with potato crisp and lot of talking...but just experience the movie as though you are there with silence..and though there are grusome and violence , force yourself to watch it....because it was our sin that Jesus bore thru sufferring and it was also the same cross He bore that save us all...from death and condemnation.        Pray as a group even with non Christians before watching it...worship before hand ..if you like...and watch it .and at the end ...start a discussion over mamak or in cell...because i believe watching the movie alone is not enough ...you need to respond to it..especially non Christians...take the time and effort to challenge them in the faith.  Cell leader...take your time to watch with your cell members , don't watch it alone..because this is something you have to share with your cell members..        Take the Bread as my body and the wine as my blood that I have shed for you...Do this in remembrance of me....

      Strange title huh? But let the pics says it all, One of the teambuilding games found in COUZ where leaders from College United Zone actually played..and it involves a listening ear, teamwork in planning, building and executing.         Team A with their masterpiece          Team B with their Ark build with wisdom given by God...(why more canggih commentary?) Cause it is my team ...that is why.. Note: That this team have no engineers from any fields...no scouts...just passionate JesusFreakers.   Wanna see that our arks works or not..whether we can truly walk on water?  The goal is to build a raft that can fit all of us ...with standard materials...like bamboos, canisters and ropes..and rowed across the pond to grab a purplish flower and everyone gets down to push the raft back , bring it shore and dissassembled it asap.  The Race is on....        In the end of the race, my team actually won but all glory be to God because the prize is that we have learned what is the core lesson to be learned...it is not about great leadership or great design or anything like that...  It is the listening ears of everyone , taking note of their opinions and trying them out one by one...  One of the Chunnest Games that is the ideas of people in Borga Campsite..and really though our body aches and hurts..with my deep cut finger bleeding nonstop ...., our hearts burn passionately to work as a team.

      Okay today i went out and bought the things that i needed to buy, fix and even cook...yes you did not heard me wrong. I cook okay...good cook as well ...Trained by my mom...hehe..  I did one cold spagghetti salad...very healthy with low fat mayonaise and while preparing the food...i have felt like Jamie, The Naked Chef in UK...with me slicing the salad leaves reallly professionally, mixing in the tunas , lime , cold spagghetti , some black pepper ....and wishing more stuff could be added... Oh well i made enough to serve one whole family...Now it is just sitting in my fridge ..cool and healthy and juicy..hmm...made my saliva drip again..  I was thinking of adding some bacon bits, tomatoes...and some salsa sauce...arrrgghh..another trip to Tesco is needed.  Perfecting the recipe is needed  and most probably i can replicate the recipe again next time . Probably try it out again on the Au Yong family and proved to some ppl like Amkayell and Jamie Neoh..that Joshua Tan can really cook and not just blabbering away like usual.. that i am a well trained house - husband...hehee..hehe.. just one of my wacky ambitions...  Have to stay off blogging as lotsa work is piling up what with work , emailing , and even preparing prayer list for the COUZ camp committee..  Pictures for COUZ Leader Retreat will come soon as i am gonna download from Millia's digicam ..which suprisingly shared the same XD slots...and have to resized to post it unto the blog.  so soon i will add pics to this posting to show my final work on the cold spagghetti salad.hehehe  :P Joshua Tan

      Ahh...back home to civilization where coke and chips rule here, where the sun will always be blocked by the ever present cloud of pollution.  Just came back from the COUZ(College United Zone) Leader's retreat in Borga..a very ulu town in Kajang ...a very hot campsite own by Grace PJ. Sigh...the things that reminded me of camp still haunts me till today ..what with body aches and cramps from all over my body and what's with the aroma and odour from Sate Kajang last nite...  The flashing flashbacks of teambuilding games, the worship encounter with God and the workshops held by Ps Lindy and Ps Lee Choo...that have been instilled in us ...remains a comforts knowing whatever we have learned still remains even today...albeit the retreat was just yesterday...even in 2 days times, it felt like a 4 day full camp conference.and really That place have been saturated with the glory of God so much so that when you breathed in ....God was everywhere.  I am gonna blog about it more as there's a lot of stuff i would like to share with Dewgem cause i believed not only the teachings taught here is to bless the COUZ here in SIBKL but i believed it applied to every College Ministry in everywhere. Borga Campsite is fanstastic for small group retreats and the games there is fanstastic...and really as i compiled pictures from everyone ...i will slowly post some pics to show u what is all about...  In the mean time use your imagination....hehehe  JOshua Tan

      Your Loves Amazes me ....Your Love , It amazes me....so croons Osbert in the praise and worship session in SIB Sunday Service..and truly as the same Spirit that inspired Ps Chris O Brien from Christian City Church to write that song , is the same spirit that brought my mom to church.  Prayers, tears and even the courage to stand each year and everytime an altar call is made to stand in the gap for my parents have been heard and even planned for this day , this moment. Truly His loves continues to amazed me even more and more. The night before in previous posting,my car have runned its last miles on the same battery for the past 2 years...and God have blessed me in the middle of my working hour with mechanic which take care of the job in less than 15 minutes.  The next morning, I went to UH to pick up my mom for church and i still dazed over the fact that my mom wanted to go to church like it is the most natural thing for her to do. My mom came to KL because my bro needed an operation on the leg to repair back the muscle tear . And really i just can't believe it and continues to even praise God for his amazing love when she came to church without any objections.  She came to church and really she just stood there hearing a message in worship and the sermon which is properly planned by the Holy Spirit about the reverance we have for the cross..John 3:16 was preached time and time again during that time. My mom was really touched when i introduced to Ps Lee Choo whom she prayed for my mom and my bro.  Another good thing is that she is staying for another week for my bro's physio and really it is by God's grace and mercy that she is staying. Easter Healing Service is just around the corner, and yeah Wow..she is coming. I just want to request from you guys to pray for her salvation ...cause I have been praying for hers for so many years.   Another miracle just happened today.My tyre got punctured today in the middle of Damansara Perdana in the hot sun where no cars stopped by to help. I called everyone as usual but to no avail. I was in the middle of changing the tyre with me muttering a prayer that someone would be sent by God to help me.  The moment i stopped a moment to rest, there stood a girl coming down from a car ....which happens to be Lin, a girl who used to be studying in the School of Photography and now working  and attends my cell Simply United and church SIBKL), she recognized me and her friend directed me to a nearby tyre repair shop and got someone to help me change the tyre.  Really God 's love amazes me...with miracles happening after even such a small simple prayer that i have grown to just have God-Dependency ....,

             I was going to , u know talk about power generation to really spread Passion of Christ around..but hey my car just now have no juice to speak of... can't start although the alarm was blaring away...  I wanna say thank you to all the people that I have phoned..Jamie Neoh, Daniel and everyone else...who gives good advice . But God have already have a solution even before the problems arises and therefore the Holy Spirit inspired an answer and there i go tapping numbers into the new phone bought a few hours ago and called up the mechanic who fixes my car before..  Tons of minutes later my car is fixed with a new battery and the cost is RM 150 ..including the service of him coming down here from SS3 ..somewhere nearby Life Legallities 's author's old house.   Just wanna say that I had a good time besides the previous posting incident . In every storm, there 's a silver lining and this does not make an exception. I have enjoyed the company of both cute chicks in my bedroom..okay cute sisters in christ , getting an update of what happenned within the 2 - 3 years we have not met up. Stop gawking or exclaiming.Let me explain.  My fren Michelle Lai , came down to KL for an interview in my company which i helped arrange. Therefore i hosted her and my other friend Claudia Pang in my house to stay over for the night. We had a good time getting an update of what have transpired within the 2 years we have not met. I am totally taken by shock when i realized another former church member that we know very closely is getting married. And she is 23. I got her invitation for her dinner in next month's time. What a shock and a wake up call for me , that i am old ...but i believe in serving God's interest first above mine...so come to think of it...nahh..  Also because this 2 JesusFreak used to be churchmates of Hope Of God. We were glad that we left that church and I am glad God have answered my prayers of even reuniting back with my past core leaders and I learned a great deal about their lives. One things for sure...the "investment" of time made in their lives  have not gone to waste ...and they still have that passion to run to God and For God.

      This early morning, have been one of my worst mistakes in life which nearly ends my 4 month old career , my company's main lines connection have dropped therefore some of the servers i monitored could not be monitored thru the TCP/IP lines . When the company's data center and ISP which are Sprint and WorldCom finishes it work and restored the lines, i found out that there was a server down. But because my position at night was to observe the whole monitoring work ...because my US counterpart collegues was actually doing the actual monitoring job, I have missed out a server which is down for quite some time due to a malfunctioned router .  My boss discovered this out of the mail of the clients complaining to him because unable to access the SAP servers...and i was screwed for it and nearly  got sacked for not reporting the incident in time.  I was quite dazed and really i was so worked up ..over the connection that i did not give a heck to my monitoring work.  Now my probation have been extended and therefore my appraisal have been given a miss. So now i am even more determined to commit more hours than i should , showing more intiatives to win my employer's heart and prove to them that the decision to hire me is not wrong. I , however gave up  a lot of my responsibilties in church and even some in life in order to focus on the priorities. I want to glorify God in my work and if my work performance gives a wrong impression on how a christian should work and his attitudes, I would like to change that by even pushing myself even further by reading up on all procedures and doing my work harder than before.  SO pray with me and for me, that God will be with me to overcome all this and really to give the best that i have got to my employers and really show to them that Christian employees are the assets of the companies.

       urlLink    Jamie Neoh of Simply United taking an oath of a member to a church. A small prayer to keep them on their toes while serving God.. Notice his utmost expression while placing his hands on the heart . &nbsp; urlLink     Uhh..Jamie Neoh..the beginning of his journey in SIBKL of serving the Lord , immersing himself in God's presence and SIBKL wonderful culture of encouragement and hospitality and of course the key word Passion.  Jamie's coming even to SIBKL is a miracle itself cause he took the intiative to even ask me to invite him to Simply United, one of the original college cell in Pastor's house. From there he started that journey of discovering how to channel his youthful exuberance and energy to serving God , discovering His wonderful grace and Power. He felt the same calling that have been revealed to him in the earlier days as a potential leader ...and he have felt the burden to serve God ...in  a very powerful way...   need i say more...? Comment on What do ya think about Jamie Neoh?   Keep all encouragement notes here and leave the negatives notes on someone' else blog not here...@!

       urlLink    Sisters..guess who's older? New members Of SIBKL ..also installed in tandem..One of them is also in Pure Joy. Melissa Wong ..my cell mate&nbsp; urlLink     This marks the happiest moments of SIB KL ,a milestones , a mark that is marked on everyone's staff ..to mark for many a new journey to serve and contribute to the Lord in a dynamic , culturally rich church where people's heart are encouraged to be passionate about the Lord. The growth of a church are not calculated in growth number of members but is a tangible unit to show how much the church have grown.  A fren of mine... urlLink Ireneq  blogs of how her journey of searching for a church ends back in her home church. She was of course have been absent for quite some time from her home church and was shocked to find her church's goals for 2004  urlLink   was stated in numbers.  But of course ppl like  urlLink BOB  gives her some reassurance  He thinks it is understandable for the church leadership to set quantifiable goals. "These days, people have problems interpreting the abstract. There's less independent and creative thought; most people are unable to think out of the box. Information is doled out in point form. They can't picture abstract ideas," he said, adding, "Think about it: which is easier to understand: 'Therefore go and make disciples of all nations' (from here), or 'Get 300 salvations'?" See his points.  Many people who are not in the church and does not understand the church's direction have lots to say about a church ..and was very quick to judge but caution is often given to people is that if u don't understand the church intenttion then don't be so quick to judge.   Churches like SIBKL, DUMC ..have always gives me the passions to serve in an environment where people still retains the culture of encouragement as though they are in small church. They are still faithfull to small little things which enables God to continue to pour His blessings upon them and help them expand their capacities for the new blessing God decides to pour upon them.  I am like in 3rd year of serving in SIBKL and i 'll have never got tired of it ..in fact i am much like warming up ...for what God have in store for us...and for God himself.  Any Comments from those from other churches about what they thought?

       urlLink    WorkOut I&nbsp; urlLink      Was tempted to go to sign up at Fitness Network to commit myself to physical remoulding ever since I took up a health supplement to boost the metabolism rate. But this title defers far from that.  Men never plans to fail but fail to plan most of the time.And well for me..I have fail to plan. Now more and more I have to buy that PDA to help me organize my work, plans and the time for everything. SO much things to do and yet I did the most idiotic things that a guy could do ... Let me give u background details about it ..In the midst of work, i received the last minute preparation of that day's WORD sharing. Ps Lindy have some emergencies to attend to which explain the lateness of the sharing. But also because we (SIMPLY UNITED) , among the college zone cells , have started a week in advance in the Purpose Driven Life Study.  But then we had a good time in cell....me ...facilitating the whole cell...No probs..in that...God was there witnesssing and teaching us What am I on Earth for ? Part II      FOUNDATION OF PURPOSE DRIVEN LIVING 1.	Life On Earth Is A Test •	Character is both developed and revealed by tests, and all of life is a test. •	When you understand that life is a test, you realize that nothing is insignificant in your life. Some test seem overwhelming, while others you don’t’ even notice.  But all of them have eternal implications. •	1 Cor 10:13, Jam 1:12 2.	Life On Earth Is A Trust •	We never really own anything during our brief stay on earth. •	How you manage your money (worldly wealth) determines how much God can trust you with spiritual blessings (true riches). •	Ps 24:1, 1 Cor 4:2, Luke 12:48b 3.	Life On Earth Is A Temporary Assignment •	Compared to eternity, life is extremely brief. •	Earth is only a temporary residence. •	You will never feel completely satisfied on earth, because you were made for more. •	Ps 119:19, 2 Cor 4:18  So Saturday Chaos starts with me missing the Early Dawn Prayer meeting that I have strongly urged my cell to go ...but me not going...because of what happen yesterday with me so tired from work the day before and to the addition of leading the cell. But praise God, I managed to make it for the Timothy Leadership Training.    urlLink    PDA of my Dreams.&nbsp; urlLink      Then later I went to Low Yat plaza to go PDA hunting that fits my budget. The Elusive Sony PEG TJ37 complete with Wifi and Palm OS. Sony have recently stop production of the SOny PDAs and now they are like Gold. Especially the TH55 ...the last product of SOny in the PDA market...which even if i have to makan bread for the next month, It was futile cause it is out of stock.  So Of course the Clie PEG TJ37 still have what i needed to organize my work and be more professional.  Okay enough about PDA and technology.  Managed to come back in time to bath and to prepare for Saturday Service preceeding before the NaNYang Night Run in Bukit Kiara.Church was half filled on that day with people wearing T-Shirts representing different camps of differing age and Districts.  Went for the walk rite after service ...a mad rush to Taman Tun ..and then managed to find Pure Joy ppl to walk with... Simply United have Siew Ching , Daphne , Wai Nyan , Jamie and Daniel Lim walking as a cell.  One word for the experience of the RUN ...is SYIOK Betul. Pure Joy ppl consisted of Javen, Darren, Melissa Wong, Chia Huey, Reena , Ken ...and of course we did the most unique thing in the entire run. We stopped before the entrance of the school when everyone else went out in a rampage..hmm..reminds me of the Spanish festival where the bull was released to chase after the ppl in town,  Pure JOy stopped near the 100plus stand to stock up drinks and walk slowly.  The walk with Pure Joy was fun, cause we share almost everything under the moon, while walking , sharing jokes..and even get to know everyone else from church.  Had a good time myself...and Melinda...Mel Wong' sis is so funny ...she walked and ran before us participating in the rampage mentioned before and when we completed the last leg of the run, she was walking like a crab...side to side in exhaustion. Mel Wong was even more funnier...her dad went like a rocket...and really in the fitness business..one have to be strong. Mel pulak is super exhausted when she completed the last leg of the "run", we actually walk.   We came back and went to makan in TTDI. And then exhausted went back home to prepare ourselves for next day...  The next day 's..I leave it as part II...to be continued.

       urlLink    TUHAN adalah terangku dan keselamatanku, kepada siapakah aku harus takut? TUHAN adalah benteng hidupku, terhadap siapakah aku harus gemetar?  Ketika penjahat-penjahat menyerang aku untuk memakan dagingku, yakni semua lawanku dan musuhku, mereka sendirilah yang tergelincir dan jatuh.  Sekalipun tentara berkemah mengepung aku, tidak takut hatiku; sekalipun timbul peperangan melawan aku, dalam hal itupun aku tetap percaya.  Satu hal telah kuminta kepada TUHAN, itulah yang kuingini: diam di rumah TUHAN seumur hidupku, menyaksikan kemurahan TUHAN dan menikmati bait-Nya.  Sebab Ia melindungi aku dalam pondok-Nya pada waktu bahaya; Ia menyembunyikan aku dalam persembunyian di kemah-Nya, Ia mengangkat aku ke atas gunung batu.  Maka sekarang tegaklah kepalaku, mengatasi musuhku sekeliling aku; dalam kemah-Nya aku mau mempersembahkan korban dengan sorak-sorai; aku mau menyanyi dan bermazmur bagi TUHAN.   &nbsp; urlLink      Yesterday, I had dinner with my cell celebrating Melissa Wong's birthday and in the end she was grilled over her life..sharing stuff that she won't even share to anyone else except her parents. and boy it is not easy to answer those question.  So when I put myself in her shoes, I myself have not been myself in the past few years. True many ppl saw me as a extrovert and a joker ...or childish guys who just seems never stop talking. But truly deep down I am not who I am ...This might be a bombshell for many of you.  For those who have served God with me throughout the years in Nilai knows who I am exactly because we have shared our lives openly, rebuking each other in love and transparency.  Mel's attitude to be open to her cell mates have struck a chord in me that I should too shared out my life ...to my cell members and readers of the blog.   I am actually very quiet guy with a need for peace and serene and would not mind doing things alone. I started out in school being the most quiet geeky guy you can think of , that pour himself over books of many types ranging from technical to fiction to non fiction.But i don't seems to develop that same passion for textbooks. In my entire school life, I have 2 friends..who one time or another have betrayed me or abandoned me. Books have been my companion throughout my entire life. I was also many times sidelined when it comes to team games and I would not mind being able to read another book. I was not a christian then but desired to become one.  I had that desire to make new friends but usually ppl often sidelined me because i babble in technical jargons...and topics is always books...which is not cool in school. In order to gain acceptance , I excelled myself in swimming representing the school in swimming competition but never won more than twice. I determined to read books of every topics and everything under the library in the hope that when i meet people, i will be able to talk to people and be intellectual about it. Sadly throughout my childhood leading to high school,...no friends..People often remebered me as quiet, confused and bookworm who never excelled in schools...obtaining a second grade in SPM.  So when i reached college, I decided to talk more and socialize..because we converse in English it was more easy. But i was still a bookworm but i excelled in my studies in IT because I have prepared myself well in those stuff even from secondary school. Then I accepted Christ one time and that is when God changed me little by little...allowing me to speak to ppl with confidence and with that joy of the Lord.  Because i was a loner, When i begin to speak with confidence ...I was so excited about having friends for the first time...I have not stop talking ever since....even until now.  But because I have not really enjoyed my childhood and my secondary school years...I have decided to wipe this part of memories from my mind ...and until now.I have not been able to retrieve it at all.  The reason of why I am so talkative is this..I am so thanksful God have blessed me with friends that I could not help it...But when I am back alone..I will be very quiet with my books.  I also used to have a murderous temper where it would flare to such a magnitude that several times I have been nearly send to Physiactric hospital. My temper would flare at times that I will hurt people physically and would not remember it at all...when i calmed down. I am glad God liberated me when I accepted the Lord and really it is His Will that I am here hanging out with u guys ,,with that peace that surpasses understanding no longer provoked ..unperturbed by anything else.  So there you have it ...my real me.

       urlLink    Firman Tuhan sentiasa menekankan and menyamakan pertemanan dengan isteri, keluarga dengan pertemanan antara Kami and Yesus Kristus&nbsp; urlLink     Even in times of missions, preparation is important and in the midst of preparing myself in BM, I came across this article.Read it and be inspired by the word of God.     Kotbah ini dirangkapkan dari einjil.com    Article diambil dari http://www.crosswalk.com Guest Column. Written by. Gordon McClellan, Ordained Presbyterian Minister  Berdasarkan Efesus 2:18-22      Kitab Suci mengatakan di Amsal 30 bahwa “semua firman Tuhan adalah murni.” Karena itu Tuhan ingin agar kita mendengarkan firmanNya dan mengubah kita menjadi baru dengannya. Seperti Yesus telah berfirman di Yohanes 3, “Aku berkata kepadamu, sesungguhnya jika seorang tidak dilahirkan kembali, ia tidak dapat melihat Kerajaan Allah." … yang berarti bahwa kerajaan Allah akan datang kepada siapa saja yang rohnya telah mendengar dan diperbarui oleh firman Tuhan. Firman firman ini dapat memperbarui kita. Pada pokoknya berarti: Melalui Yesus Kristus kita dapat datang kepada Tuhan… di dalam Yesus Kristus kita telah melihat kehendak Allah Maha Kuasa di dalam hidup kita, dan berkat Kristus kita tidak lagi asing terhadap Tuhan dan sesama.   Poin pokok yang kita harus dengar adalah bahwa tidak ada hubungan yang lebih penting, tidak ada segi kehidupan yang lebih penting, daripada untuk mengenal dan mempunyai hubungan dengan Tuhan. Inilah sebabnya Tuhan memberi kita Yesus Kristus.   Firman firman selanjutnya di Efesus terus menggaris bawahi poin ini. Dikatakan bahwa kita semua disatukan dalam Kristus, dan sama-sama dapat datang kepada Tuhan. Dan dikatakan bahwa didalam Kristus setiap dari kita, anda dan saya, dibangun bersama-sama mejadi dalam satu tubuh dimana Tuhan hidup. Itulah kita – satu tubuh yang sedang dibangun bersama-sama untuk bersatu menjadi satu keluarga dimana Tuhan hidup. Sekali waktu Yesus pernah ditanya dimanakah kerajaan Allah akan dibangun, dan Dia mejawab bahwa itu akan dibangun di dalam hati kita. Tetapi hati kita dapat mendengar dan mengetahui hanya melalui hubungan dengah Tuhan sendiri. Apakah di dalam hati anda rindu untuk mengenal dan untuk bersama dengan Tuhan? Apakah anda mempunyai suatu dorongan untuk melayani Tuhan? Semua orang diundang, tetapi semua orang harus menerima undangan. Dan undangan yang kita terima adalah jalan masuk menuju hubungan dengan Tuhan dimana Tuhan adalah pemandu kita yang harus kita percayai sepenuhnya, kepada siapa kita menggantungkan semua kebutuhan kita, dan dari siapa kita menerima panduan.   Mazmur 32 mengatakan “Aku hendak mengajar dan menunjukkan kepadamu jalan yang harus kautempuh…” Mazmur 48 mengatakan “Karena Allah inilah Allah kami kekal selama-lamanya, maka Ia juga akan memimpin kami sampai kepada mati.” Yesaya 42 ditulis sebagai perkataan dari Tuhan, “Aku mau memimpin orang-orang buta di jalan yang tidak mereka kenal… Aku mau membuat kegelapan yang di depan mereka menjadi terang dan tanah yang berkeluk-keluk menjadi tanah yang rata. Itulah hal-hal yang hendak Kulakukan kepada mereka, yang pasti akan Kulaksanakan…”   Jadi sekarang adalah waktunya untuk menjalin hubungan baik dengan Yesus Kristus. Tuhan akan memimpin dan telah mengundang setiap dari kita untuk menjalin hubungan denganNya…. Untuk dituntun dan dipimpin, dihibur dan diutuhkan…. Untuk menjadi bagian dari satu tubuh dimana Tuhan hidup. Tidak ada hubungan yang lebih baik daripada dengan Tuhan, yang mana kita dapat bertumbuh melalui doa yang rutin dan sungguh-sungguh. Inilah panggilan yang Kristus telah sebarkan ke setiap orang: Untuk menyerahkan diri kepadaNya. Untuk menghadapNya tiap tiap hari dan percaya sepenuhnya kepadaNya. Untuk menyerahkan masa depan hidup kita, masa depan gereja kita, pekerjaan kita, semuanya kedalam tangan Tuhan dan mengatakan “Tuhan, aku menyerahkan diri kepadaMu.”   Yesus telah menyerahkan diri kepada kita. Di Yohanes 10 Yesus mengingatkan kita bahwa Dialah “gembala yang baik. Gembala yang baik memberikan nyawanya bagi domba-dombanya …. Bapa mengasihi Aku, oleh karena Aku memberikan nyawa-Ku untuk menerimanya kembali. Tidak seorangpun mengambilnya dari pada-Ku, melainkan Aku memberikannya menurut kehendak-Ku sendiri." Dan kitab suci mengatakan bahwa kita harus “Serahkanlah hidupmu kepada TUHAN dan percayalah kepada-Nya.” Di Lukas 9 Yesus ingin setiap dari kita untuk “menyangkal dirinya (sendiri -red), memikul salibnya setiap hari dan mengikut Aku.” Semua hal harus kita bawa dihadapan Allah didalam doa, menyadari bahwa Tuhan adalah batu kita, sumber hidup kita, dan hubungan yang terpenting dalam hidup kita.

Lately I have not been patient and take things too fast rather than to wait for God's timing. I echoed and relate to the ramblings from  urlLink IreneQ  In her postings of Waiting...waiting...  For now ..I want to surrender  to God...and like someone in the blog said ...that you have to be completely surrendered to God...and it also echoed in the bible..to die to yourself, pick up the cross and follow Him.  For now I am contented to be in God's presence , slowly finding purposes in the places He have placed me. In Work, in Cell and in Church. In the company of friends...and in family . God have a wonderful plan for me in Malaysia..God also have a wonderful plan for Malaysia and to the rest of the world. But all of this gonna happen in His TIme.

       urlLink     A Prayer for Our Generation&nbsp; urlLink     Indeed as you see in times like this, more and more prayers is needed for the furtherance of God's kingdom. A wall have been built near the Holy of Holies and this shows that the end times is coming. But even that gives us the urgencies to even pray more and to share out God's love in this times.  Passion is one of the greatest movie to be filmed and shown with Passion is gonna be screened in Malaysia thanks to the DAP from Seputeh who fights for the right of Christians to see the movie. Don't know how the censorship is gonna censor it but I pray that the movie will not be censored to retain its full purpose in showing how our Savior died for us..How much love He have poured out to see that the sins of men are washed clean so that we can give our greatest adoration. How He longs to see us worship Him...with a clear conscious heart and a sweet spirit.  I pray that we would now even respond to God's love by even preparing your okios for the movie. So let's respond yea ...for the coming of Christ.  Let's pray for the Malays of Malaysia able to sneak a peek at what is in store for them in the Passion..to realize there is a true living God who defied death and truly lives . A God that loves them for He have created them with tender loving care and details.  Bapa di Syurga, kami ingin menyayangi Bapa dengan sepenuh hati kita, dengan minda kita , dengan sepenuh jiwa kita. kami ingin lihat kawan kita, saudara kita, keluarga kita datang ke dalam dakapan Tuhan. Anda Bapa ,betapa sayangnya and kasih kepada kita sehingga kamu menyerahkan anak KesayanganMu supaya dosa dosa kami dapat dilupuskan.   Dengan itu, kami ingin serahkan segala hidup kami dalam tanganMu supaya NamaMu dimuliakan untuk selama lamanya. Kami sembahMu kerana kami cinta Mu Yesus.  Dalam nama Yesus Kami Berdoa Amin
