						   I hope everyone had the Merriest of Christmases.  I had a good Christmas.  An even better Christmas Eve.  One biff: our relatives think we're too old for presents now.  When did Christmas become just a kids' holiday?  I also think since I haven't automatically taken over baby-sitting duties, I have fallen in less favor with some aunts and uncles.  Right now I'm kinda sick of family obligations and guilt-trips.  I'm happy to play with the kids, but I was getting tired of automatically having the kids just handed to me.  I've been doing that for so long.  Some of my cousins are old enough to take over.  If it's all about obligations and guilt-trips, then it's time they start paying their dues.  Sorry for getting bitter.  I'm sick with a cold and yesterday ended on a less-than-high note.

						   I used to love the rain.  Now I kinda see it as a nuisance.  But today I gave thanks for the rain.  I was driving back from church, around 2 pm, when I noticed that the hills by this one stretch of the freeway looked different.  I thought it was because I was seeing them in the daytime.  (This part has very little light, so I'm used to driving through it in the dark when coming back from visiting friends and seeing nothing but looming black  things .)  Anyway, I finally realized what it was.  The hills were   green.    There had been so little rain this past year that I was too used to them being brown and dead.  But everywhere I looked, there was a green covering on the hills, and the trees were greener, and the sky, though still a bit gray with storm-brewin' clouds, never looked more beautiful.  It looked like a scene from Oklahoma or some State around there.  It looked downright  Irish.   Speaking of emeralds (cuz... y'know, Emerald Isle... nickname of Ireland... yeah?  yeah?), I saw a really beautiful emeral necklace at a jewelry store at South Coast Plaza.  Sooo green.  Sooo pretty.

						   I am such a geek that I could ramble on and on about  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  but I won't.  Tolkien is on the "respectable" side of geekdom, but I have a feeling that the number of geeks now is probably around the same number as it always has been.  (Well, since the invention of geeks around the 1950's.)  But it's just that more people are "out of the closet."  For instance, it's hard to find people who  don't  like the Star Wars Trilogy (the original), and shows like  Star Trek  have come into the main stream.  And most people nowadays are impressed with people that know a lot about computers (and want to learn themselves).  I'm guessing it's because of the nature of youth society today, based on video games and collectible trading card games and television.  Yeah, we as a nation need to be more active.  But the side-effect of our laziness is that not only is the pasty-faced, weak-muscled, bespectacled kid accepted, it is the majority.  Except in low-income neighborhoods, of course.  And that's another topic....

						   During dinner tonight, my parents and I got to talking about some really interesting family history:  Somehow during the Japanese occupation, my grandfather (my dad's dad) learned english.  Not fluently, of course, but enough.  After WWII, he worked in a "gang" to catch "reds", i.e. Communists.  The way my dad describes it, they were killed, though I don't know if these gangs did the killing themselves.  If so, that's more violent than I would wish it was.  Anyway, this came about when I was asking my dad what Grandpa did for a living before he joined the army.  For about five years after WWII and before the Korean War, Soviet Communists were coming in and people, especially in the South, tried to resist and ferret them out.  So Grandpa was part of those toughs that would go around rooting up Communists and beating them up.  (What's really sad about this part is that it was Koreans vs. Koreans, which is essentially what the Korean War ended up doing.)  They were paid by the politicians of the newly setup post-occupation government.  Once the Korean War was declared (June 25th, or yook-ee-oh which means six-two-five) then the Communists in hiding started cropping up even more, and the whole gang was threatened.  So they packed up the families plus supplies (in a GMC truck) and moved south.  Later, my grandpa  walked  to join his family.  How scary is that?  So during the Korean War, the US Army needed translators and they were recruiting anybody who could do any sort of translating.  So thus began my grandpa's army career.  He was a lieutenent colonel when he left.  Then this led to a discussion about how my parents studied english in school, which I won't go into now, but it kinda brought up something.  I could make some major dough teaching english in Korea.  Even for just a short while.  Considering my jobless state, I am seriously tempted.

						    Happy Friday the 13th!     The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition  rocks!!!   I really love the new parts.  They deal mostly with character and not much with plot (it would have to be, otherwise Peter Jackson couldn't really cut them out to begin with) but they do so much to expand each character, especially the hobbits.  I'm such a fan-girl.  On other news, not much else.  Applied at yet another retail store.  We'll see if I actually get a call.  Would it be considered discrimination if you don't get hired cuz you're too educated?  Nowadays so many over-qualified people apply for all types of low-wage jobs.  I've heard of PhDs applying for lab assistant jobs.  Stuff usually reserved for undergrads.  I'll eventually put a link to this blog on my website.  I think a major overhaul is necessary.  The whole Flash journal gave me ideas.

						   Well, spent yet another night at the Art Center.  Didn't get anything done.  Watched the various videos on the official  urlLink "Lord of the Rings"  website.  Good stuff, though don't want to spoil the movie.  Don't think they will.  Such great details.  Can't wait to see Eowyn and Aragorn together.  Also checked out stuff on the  urlLink Firefly  website.  It's a great show.  I'm just sad at the low ratings.  It's going on hiatus in the spring.  I hope the show comes back.  It's so unique and well-done.  It's the anti-sci-fi show.  All character-driven, with really cool characters.  My character in the Greyhawk RPG campaign that my friend Robert was running (for only one session) was based off the character Inara, who is a whore, though in the show they're called "companions."  And not only is it a legal business, it's highly respected.  Like geishas.  And the mix of western and Asian styles gives the show such a cool look.  Not to mention all the cussing in Mandarin. :)  I remember gushing like a fangirl in front of Joss Whedon at Comicon 2001.  Well, "Firefly" would make me gush only further.  Though I would rather come off sophisticated and witty.  Ah well.

						   Ooga booga.  Must kill, kill,  KILL !!!  (Um, that's too much Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance talking.)  I'm sorta wondering how many people read this thing.  I mean, I read other people's blogs without posting on their guestbooks.  But occasionally, I do tell people when I see them in person that I enjoy their blogs.  So... well, I don't want to seem pushy, but go ahead and sign my guestbook.  I just would like to know if anyone's reading.   urlLink SAVE FARSCAPE !!!  Hey it's a good show!  Anybody out there have a remedy for eczema or really flaky skin?

						   Didja see this past Sunday's episode of  Alias ???  OMG!!!  I felt like they just did a complete 180!  And the opening shots of Sydney in lingerie were obviously meant to keep the football fans watching.  Anyway, I managed to watch most of the Super Bowl commercials, though I did tune out for an hour while I napped and also during  The Simpsons .  They were pretty good.  I cared less about the game, though I do know plenty of Raiders fans that are disappointed.  Yesterday was my friend Andrea's 24th birthday.   Happy Birthday!!!   I can't believe I've known her since fifth grade.  Now it's come to I've known her longer than not known her.

						   Kinda peckish, though I need to go to bed soon.  I like that  urlLink Pillar Bible Church  is early in the morning.  I mean, it sucks cuz it's so tough to wake-up in the morning (and out the door by 8:50 at the latest!) but it's also great cuz it gives me the whole day afterwards to do whatever it is I need to do.  Usually I drop by OfficeMax to see if there's anything free after rebate.  Then I spend read through the Sunday LA Times.  Worked some more on Dad's presentation.  It's now mostly adding a lot more pictures, though he wants to add a lot of corny animations and transitions.  As my video professor said, any transition other than cross-dissolve is pretty corny and outdated.  But then, that's video.  It's kinda funny that since George Lucas put those wipes and whatnots in the original Star Wars Trilogy, he now has to put them in the prequels.

						    urlLink Hilarius  and a bit gay.  I've been working on a PowerPoint presentation for my dad.  I realized that even though I get frustrated with my dad that he can't pick up on things as quick as I'd like him to, that's no excuse for the way I've been treating him.  I just need to somehow work out a "Not now Dad" that he won't get pissed at.  Dang, my sleep pattern is off...  AGAIN !!!

						   I saw  Star Trek: Nemesis  today.  That was... not a great movie.  The curse has been broken.  Well, it was much more enjoyable if you're a Trekkie.  Basically, I didn't get the motivations of the villain.  And the whole plot premise was... confusing.  Not that the plot was hard to understand.  It's just that they tried to do what  Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country  did, except that the story patted itself up to be more important than it was.  It was a dramatic ending, though.  I wish they had a bigger cameo for Janeway.  I wonder if they're further exploring in the novels what happened to the Voyager crew after they got home.  And I'm having trouble with my schedule at  urlLink SMC .  Gonna have to have a chat with the counselors.

						   Ok, so far it's 4-for-4  against  Brooks College.  Let this be a lesson: when schools have to advertise on TV to get students, then it's probably not a good school.  Actually, they seem pretty good for the really traditional design stuff: fashion design, fashion merchandising, and interior design.  I'm still waiting a response from another random person whose resume I found on the web.  (On a side note, a lot of these people were surprised that I got their e-mail addresses off the web.  I guess they don't realize how thorough those crawlers on  urlLink Google  is.)  The Flash version of my website is up, but it's so sparse that it's hardly worth perusing.

						    The Golden Globes ... eh.  No biggie this year.  Wish  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  won something.  Stuuuuupid flash.  Arg.  But on a side note, an all new all-flash site on the way!  Babies are cute.  Especially newborns.  Awwww.  Still don't want to take care of them.  Someone at church wanted me to take over her kindergarten Sunday school class.  Umm... I don't think I've got the patience for kindergarteners.  Heck, I barely had patience for 9-yr-olds.

						   Let this be a lesson to me: when trying to catch a movie at a certain time, make sure to leave early enough, especially if you don't know where the movie theater is and you have to drive around in circles trying to find it.  I've been having odd food cravings.  And no, I'm not pregnant.     I think I'm actually more of a subject of advertising and taste memories.  Dang, I gotta quell these or otherwise I'll end up really unhealthy.  Or maybe then I can sue McDonald's.  Tonight is Friday, and  Firefly  is still cancelled.  I've been watching the DVD of  Farscape  first season.  It's a pretty good show.  I was saying that it reminded me a lot of  Firefly , though  Farscape  came first.  Hey, I got no cable TV.  Let it be known that some of the best shows out there are the ones that are character-driven.  At least in sci-fi spaceship shows.  American Idol is starting up next week.  Do I watch or not?  The episodes of the open auditions are hilarious, once Simon gets his claws out.  But watching some previews, I think he's being nastier than usual.  I think the FOX execs told him to turn it up a notch.  How sad.  I totally agree in not coddling those that simply do not have the talent to make it in the business, but telling the truth is one thing.  Cruelty is another.  There goes that Jack-in-the-Box ad again.  Mmmm... 99¢ bacon cheeseburger.  Must... resist....

						   I went to a women's seminar today with some fellow Pillar Bible Church sisters.  It was really good.  It was called "Idols of the Heart -- Learning to Long for God Alone" and the speaker was Elyse Fitzpatrick, who has written several books.  It was eye-opening.  I didn't think I was being idolatrous with my desire for a career, but it was, since I desired it more than desiring to know God.  Is God's loving kindness worth more than life?  Well, if a gunman came up to you and said, "Deny Christ, or I will kill you."  Well, most Christians will refuse and die.  But rarely is temptation that obvious or drastic.  But when I'm facing my dwindling bank account, parental pressure (to get any job even if I don't like it as long as it makes a lot of money), and the general suckiness of being unemployed, can I say, "God's loving kindness is enough?"  Well, truthfully, no, I can't.  I wish I could, and I'm praying that I could, but at this moment, I don't think I can say it.  With that, I'm worried about the pending war with Iraq.  I really wish we don't have to go to war.  But I also know that Saddam Hussein needs to be deposed.  And I'm not sure how we're going to do that without war.  If called to go to war, could I do it?  I don't know.  I could say for a just war I could, but there's no such thing.  Feel free to drop me a line regarding these thoughts.  My e-mail addy is on the left.

						    urlLink My current desktop image.   Sorry it's a bit big.  I couldn't figure out how to link to the smaller picture.  I was reading some blogs of people that I used to know at KCPC.  And it got me thinking.  It wasn't until senior year of high school that I realized that I didn't care whether or not I was popular and involved in all the popular activities, as long as I was happy and had a handful of really good friends that I could count on.  Well, during college, at church I realized that I tried to do almost the same thing.  I wanted to be one of the "popular" kids, i.e. the ones that were highly visible.  The ones that got mentioned by Pastor Eugene by name during his messages at FiCB.  The ones that were part of the in-jokes during Senior Banquet.  But it's all pointless.  Yeah, KCPC wasn't the excruciating social experiment as high school, but invariably, in a large organization, you're going to have cliches.  And that means that you'll have popular kids.  And it kills me that even after learning that I didn't like playing the game during high school, that I unwittingly placed myself in the games during college.  But I'm not saying that I was complete social outcast.  I had my handfull of really good friends, and a bigger handfull of mildly-close friends.  And though I didn't stand out, I didn't fade out either.  But then, that's most people.  Smack dab in the middle.  I'm such a follower.  I really wish I had the courage and strength to march to my own drum and not be afraid to be different and not try so hard to fit-in to someone else's group and instead make my own group.  Like my friend Erica.  I have to admire her for that, cuz even though she's part of a gazillion social circles, she's not afraid to be herself and make friends with the people she wants to.  It's almost 4 am.  I should sleep.  Watching the rerun New Year's Eve episode of Conan O'Brien on TV right now.  He is so hilarious.  I remember thinking that he was sooo terrible when he first started.  But then he got his stride when he started his now-trademark humor: self-deprecating, i-can't-believe-he-just-did-that humor.  Makes me want to go to New York to see a taping.

						   Now and then, I think about all the things I've done in my life and cringe over mistakes I've made and the times I stuck my foot in my mouth.  I think I should stop doing that.  After all, the people I offended or slighted probably don't remember what happened.  Or else, they ceased to care.  But then, every now and then, I think about times other people have hurt me or offended me, and I do get a little mad again.  So... uh-oh.  I guess now I gotta think of it as... everybody makes mistakes.  Let it go.  Let it goooooo.  Cold symtoms update: a set of 2 coughs every 10 to 15 mins, less during meal times.

						   New Year's Eve was spent baby-sitting my 3-and-9-yr-old cousins.  The older one had friends over for a party while their parents went out for a party of their own.  It wasn't too bad.  Though I got rather sick of  Power Rangers: Wild Force , which my aunt has deemed better than WWF.  I guess.  He, thankfully, fell asleep at 9:30.  Also, thank the Lord, my grandparents were there, so I didn't have to deal with his stinky diapers.  I thought he'd be toilet-trained by now.  Also,  The Two Towers  on the IMAX screen =  majorly awesome .  And not in the 80's slang term, but its original meaning.  On a side note, last night there was some really heavy winds and a blackout for about three hours.  I hope my computer didn't suffer any problems.  (Hey, gotta know what's important!  j/k)

						   Y'know I don't get God.  I certainly don't expect life as a Christian to be full of happiness and no worries.  Yet, it seems like when something good happens, something bad accompanies it.  Or maybe it's the other way around.  Anyway, it's one of those mysteries of God that just blows my mind.

						   I just sat through 3.5 hrs of mind-numbing boredom.  It's the first day of an introductory computer class (for graphics) where he started with... (dum da da dah)  how to double-click.   I kid you not.  The way he was talking... I felt like I was trapped in a room full of 40-yr-old technophobes.  I should have gotten out during the break, but that's when I was still deciding whether or not I belong in that class, and I realized too late that I didn't.  Brain slowing dying....

						   Okay, I feel like whining so brace yourself.  My parents and a couple of friends wished me a happy birthday on or right before my birthday... and that's it.  Sure I don't expect friends that I haven't seen or talked to much to remember, but I would expect my own siblings, people that share my gene pool, to say something.  And then there's the matter of a couple of friends that have been my closest friends since childhood....  Believe me, I'm not bitter, just a bit disappointed.  I've taken two classes so far.  My schedule is still so screwy.  I'm not going to go into details just yet.  Today's class was action figure drawing, and the model was this really tall and slender woman with an absolutely flat stomach and not an ounce of cellulite.  Dang, that's all I can say.  The drive hasn't been bad so far, except I have to endure rush-hour traffic on Thursdays to make it from class to Bible study.  We started Crown Financial Bible study.  Everything's fascinating so far.  E-mail me if you want an elaboration.

						   Nooo... don't look at me... I'm  hideous ... I'm  revolting ... I'm...   OLD!!!!!!!    Heh heh.  I'm just kidding.  Turning 24 wasn't as traumatic as I thought.  I think because I was surrounded by other people that were older than me.  Of my peers, that is.  Big thanks to y'all that called.  A big phooey to y'all that didn't.  According to the chinese zodiac, this is  my  year.  Well, the year for all 24 yr olds.  And 12 yr olds.  And 36, 48, and 60 yr olds.  Whatever.  I'm currently at  urlLink SMC  waiting for class to start.  The drive wasn't too bad.  Mainly cuz all the congestion was going the other way.  Listening to Ryan Seacrest call Lisa Fox a slut on the radio made it more enjoyable.  So is a possible job prospect!  Wish me luck, and please pray for me!  Even if you're not Christian!

						   For the first time in a long time, Valentine's Day didn't make me bitter.  Well, I was never actually bitter before, but from the time I learned what Valentine's Day was 'til about two year's ago, I was never crazy about the day since it reminded me how... lacking my social life was.  Then, the last two V-Days (not this year's) I actually had a boyfriend.  And... it was nice.  But then I realized that it wasn't any more special than any other day of the year.  It just gave you an excuse to get mushy.  So this Valentine's Day, boyfriend-less, I just enjoyed the day like any other day, went to a church Valentine's fellowship, and at the end of it, I feel pretty good.  No sense of bitterness.  Not even subconsciously.  For the fellowship, we went to dinner theater and saw Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.  It was pretty good.  I mean, it's a real low-cost production.  The stage was small, the sets were minimal, and the cast was small.  The choreography was so-so, but then, none of them were really great dancers.  However, they all sang well, and it was an entertaining production.  Part of that is from the libretto, of course.  One highlight was that the guy who played Joseph was hot.  He had a niiiiice chest.  And he was a better singer than the others.  Or perhaps he was just better mic-ed.  Anyway, overall it was an enjoyable day.

						   My legs are  killing  me from all that jumping yesterday!!!  I used to think that blogs were a cheap excuse for people to not keep in touch with you, but I'm finding it has the opposite effect.  Mainly cuz I'm a lazy person and really bad about contacting people.  Anyway, I like to read blogs of people that I sorta know but are not that close to (and therefore a bit wary of contacting personally, though in a perfect world, we shouldn't fear doing that).  I hope that any of you out there that are reading this because you knew me from afar and just want to see what I'm up to w/o actually sending me an e-mail, well, that's okay cuz I do it too.  But drop me a line (or at least sign my guestbook) once in awhile and I promise I won't bite...  hard . ;-)  We had steak today for dinner.  Mmmmm.  I usually have two types of cravings: sweets and meat.  And by meat, I mean hamburgers and steaks.  I think I helped contribute to my ex's bad diet whenever I had these cravings.  We cooked them on broil in the toaster oven, and that took darn near forever.  It was a perfect medium, though.  Medium well in certain spots.  But the meat temperature never reached 150.  Which makes me think that we baked those steaks more than broiled them.  My parents and I were discussing the last time we had meat at home, and I remember buying filet mignon from Costco once, when they were on sale (and they were being served in the Costco buffet), but that was back in OC, more than 3.5 years ago.  What's sorta funny is that since they were so thick, we had cut them thick-wise to make thinner.  We didn't know that filet mignon was suppose to be cut that thick.

						   I'm sitting at my Uncle Sun's computer typing this, and his computer is  damn slow !!!  500 Mhz P3 chip with  64 megs  of RAM.  No wonder it's so slow.  The internet connection's also at 28.8.  Sooo ancient.  Anyway, I'm pooped.  I came over to my Aunt & Uncle's around 10 am to help make balloons and put up decorations.  The kids started arriving at 11.  Nothing like a buncha 3-6 yr-olds jumping around on those air jumpers to tire you out.  I figured out the secret to getting kids to like you: play with them.  *gasp!  No way!!!  Yep, it must be a surprise to all y'all, but that's the key.  And so my relatives keeps remarking on how the kids love me.  And it's for no other reason than,  I play with them.   Not just stand around and watch, mind you.  Actually get in that jumper and jump around with them.  Because of that, they love me.  So now, young grasshopper, you know the secret to baby-sitting.  Go out there in the world and make me proud.  Speaking of the jumper (y'know that I mean, those inflatable gyms that has air blowing through it, and the kids jump around on the inside), I think I re-twinged my back when I tried to do some flips and such.  As y'all know, I hurt my back doing hankido my senior year.  I think the combination of the flips and the fact that I've been sedentary for months, led to my current everything-hurts-when-I-move state.  Now I'm soooo tired, I'm not sure how I'll drive home.  On a different note, anybody see the Michael Jackson interview?  It was so disturbing.  That whole thing about his face and the kids sleeping over...  shudder.   I think I get his psyche, though.  Every teen goes through low self-image (which was made worse by his father) but not every teen has the money to go through plastic surgery.  And being in the public probably hasn't helped.  I see it like if you gave an anorexic a ton of money for plastic surgery.  Of course she will get lipo-ed up the wazoo until she's a freaky shadow of a person.  Well, I see that with Jacko's surgeries.  He doesn't have a normal self-image, yet he has the money to transform himself into what he thinks is normal, though it's freaky to everyone else.  Now, he's a great entertainer, I have to say.  Possibly one of the greatest.  And if he wants to spend money to look like that, then I say, who cares?  My concern is that he needed psychiatric counseling about this matter a looong time ago.  Another thing: I think this whole kids sleeping over thing is Jacko's denial that he is a grown man.  A grown  middle-aged  man.  I think his mind is still trapped in the mind of a pre-adolescent boy.  And to a 12-yr-old boy, having sleepovers with other 12-yr-old boys is no big deal.  I saw it when I saw him shopping.  He shops like a kid in a candy store.  What he wants, he gets.  Now, I'm not sure if he did molest any of those boys, but that may also have to deal with pre-adolescent sexual experimentation.  I worry that his kids are getting royally messed up right now.  (Anybody else think that Debbie Ro was a paid surrogate who were forced to marry when the news leaked out?)

						   I just hopped over to view my Guestbook, and well, it seems my little rant against Kaplan has gotten some responses.  Ooh!  To clarify, what had happened was that the center manager had sent out an e-mail with an Excel worksheet asking us to fill out the ones we wanted (with alternates).  Well, I sent it in (though I do have to say that it was a few hours late since that night as I was writing the e-mail the Santa Anas knocked the power out) and then a few days later I e-mailed the center manager asking him about my status.  Well, then another week later, he called me to schedule an appointment to discuss pay stuff (everybody had to do it) and then he informed me that he passed off the job of class scheduling to the associate manager.  Well, the next day I e-mailed  her  about my status.  And that's when she replied saying that classes are first come first serve, and that there were only two classes left.   Well.   I got pissed at that (though not to her) and made my little rant.  Basically, they  ignored  my requests.  Like they never even got that stupid Excel file.  So as of now, I only have one class that meets twice a week until the end of March.   And then I have no frickin' income... AGAIN.   There won't be more classes 'til  summer .  Yeah, I'm ticked.

						   What the heck am I doing with my life?  So far, I've just been escaping, not dealing with it.  Classes start in two weeks but I don't even know what my schedule is.  Or at least what classes I want to crash.  My not getting the Thurs/Sun class for Kaplan, however, has enabled me to attend Crown Bible Study and take Animation I at SMC.  But I really could have used the extra six hours a week.  *sigh.  It seems like I've sent a gazillion e-mails to job listings, yet nary a reply.  It's gotten so that when I do get a reply, I have no idea what job it was that I applied for.  Could somebody please tell me that things will get better soon?  I mean, really sure, like I'm-psychic-and-I-can-see-the-future sure?

						   That's it.  I am sick and tired of Kaplan.  Maybe no one told me, but there seems to be a one class limit on the number of classes I can teach.  Not officially, but all I ask for are three little classes, two of them in February and one in May, but it's like they didn't even look at my requests!  It was only when I finally asked about my status when they asked me which one I wanted out of the only two classes left!  Stupid!!!  I gotta get a better job.  Screw the pay, it's not worth dealing with all this crap.

						   Done!   urlLink I am Arwen .  Well, sorta.  I think I'll use that as the background of my website, once I get around to tooling around with it once again.  I'm just so tired.  I miss having days where I have absolutely nothing to do.  I mean, too many of those will drive you nuts, but it's good to have one of those once a week.  Right now I go to school Tuesday/Thursday/Friday, and work Monday/Wednesday/Saturday (albeit for not too long), and there's church on Sunday.  I'm just really getting sick of driving.  Spring Break in two more weeks!  I would like to put more of my artwork on my website, but a lot of it is in the form of drawings now that I'd have to take a picture of.  Not too many digital works.  Animation class if fun, but the basics aren't that fun to watch.  But basically, there's no easy way for me to take a VHS tape, digitize it, and then mess around with it on a computer to compress it.  And even if I could, the quality would be so bad, that it wouldn't be worth it to watch a boring piece anyway.

						   Today on the way to school, I was stuck in really slow traffic.  All these police cars kept going past us on the left shoulder, and finally, those police stopped traffic, and I was the third in line in my lane.  I was thinking, oh great, there's a major accident on the other side but they're stopping traffic on  this  side too?  Well, turns out, they had to stop both sides so a medical helicopter could land.  I saw them load someone on a stretcher and then take off.  I was wondering why they had to stop our side, too, but I think it was because they either didn't want people to rubberneck and possibly get into accidents, or else it was just in case the helicopter could crash.  Fascinating, actually.  I became less pissed about being held up in traffic.  Of course, I tend to get non-chalant about being on time when it comes to class.  I should stop that.  Our model today was someone we had before, i think.  Only I think last time he wasn't nude.  He was a really good model cuz he had a classic body.  Really well defined muscles.  Michaelangelesque.

						   Can somebody please shut these celebrities up???  And can we shut these people that respond to celebrities up???  Why do we give celebrities all this power?  They're frickin' entertainers, people!  Last I checked, very few of them are even qualified to talk about the war.  So they can sing, dance, and recite lines.  Umm... have they studied political science and public policy and world diplomacy?  Most of them barely finished high school, much less college!  I could care less what these celebrities think about the war.  I don't care what people were or were not wearing (accessory-wise) at the Oscars.  Though I do have to say that I really liked Renee Zellwegger and Jennifer Gardner's dresses.  One thing I have been thinking about: I think I am a coward.  I remember saying (jokingly) that if they ever drafted women, I would flee to Canada or even get myself a bun in the oven.  Or use my friend's father's excuse when his number came up for Vietnam.  He just complained and whined about migraines during boot camp 'til he got dismissed.  Anyway, I do have to admire enlisted soldiers (as well as police officers, fire-fighters, CIA agents, etc) that are willing to die doing their duty.  I am such a wimp.  I mean, I know that nobody wants to die, but I don't know if I'd be willing to die for my country.  Or for anyone.  I thank God I probably won't ever be asked to, but when the time comes, I think I'll turn tail and run away.  Was Jesus afraid when he knew that he going to die for the sake of others?  Was he afraid to die in general?  I mean, at least he knew it was coming, he knew his purpose, and he knew what he was doing is his Father's will.  But as the time of his crucifixion was approaching, did he dread the hour when he would breathe his last?  (Well, until the resurrection, of course.)  When I come face-to-face with death, how will I react?

						   Here's something that a friend of mine said to me recently that got me thinking: many other countries are opposed to this war because they're saying that the US is a bully and they're acting like the world's police.  But someone has to be the world's police, and since no one else is going to do it, the US will.  So should the US be the world's police?  I mean, other countries have no problem asking the US for money or for humanitarian aid.  But few countries ask for help to overthrow a corrupt government.  I mean, duh, no government is going to ask for help to overthrow itself.  But if a government has to be overthrown, whose job is it?  Wilson, during WWII, had this isolationist policy that hey, it's Europe's war, not ours.  Until, of course, Japan joined in.  So would things have been different if the US had joined in when Hitler invaded Poland?  That was 1939, and the bombing of Pearl Harbor wasn't until 1941.  Two years.  What would the outcome have been?  So whose job is it to get rid of all those despots out there?  Like I said before, I would really like someone to take out Kim Jong Il.  I think that the US has taken on this role mainly because no other country, other than Israel, is more hated than us.  So we are a target (as Sept 11th showed).  But why do they hate us so much?  Cuz we're big and we throw our weight around?  Cuz we're arrogant and rich and oblivious to the world's poverty?  Cuz we act like the world's police?  Hmmm.  Makes me wonder.  No, I'm not calling for an isolationist policy.  It's a global world, like it or not.  But with the exception of oil and cheap labor, the US theoretically could become totally isolated and survive just fine.  On a side note, KFI talk radio is having a ball making fun of the protesters in LA.  I can't blame them, some of these protesters have no clue!  Reminds me of some Berkeleyites that protested for the sake of protesting, not knowing anything about what they're protesting about.  I'm just glad I don't have to drive through Wilshire Blvd.

						   So... we're now at war.  Sucks.  But I do support the troops out there, and I hope God will bring them ALL home safely.  I can't relate, not having anyone close to me in the armed forces.  I only hope that I can be a support for those that do.  Hey, trust that God has it all under control.  Even in the midst of chaos, little things pop up that reminds us that God is looking out for us.  My car is finally fixed... and I swear, you couldn't even tell that it was in that accident.  The only reminder is some scratches along the side, and I think the power-steering is out.  (Though that might be because I've gotten too used to driving my brother's brand-new Honda Accord.  Though I am grateful for his generosity, it saddens me a bit to have to return it to him.  It's such a nice car.  Even going 80 feels like floating.)  Anyway, the God-is-Good part is... the garage gave us a HUGE discount.  Well manageable.  Thank you thank you thank you!!!  For those of you that can patronize this garage, it is the Inland Sun's Auto Center in Montclair, on Holt and Central.  A nice Korean woman runs it (I think she took over from her husband) and she is really, really, really nice.  Anyway, here's to hoping that this war will be over SOON.

						   Here I go, ranting again:         :)  To practice being "professional" we have to mount all our homework projects on illustrations boards AND she recommends printing out the stuff on glossy coated paper.  Now... the illustration boards costs 2 bucks for a simple 18" x 24" and our next project requires bigger!  And printing glossy?  65 cents at nice places, $1.79 at not-so-nice places.  Per page!  How many projects do we have?  I haven't counted, but I think it's at least six.  Oh, and we should use spray mount, not glue, so that's another few dollars for a can of that stuff.  I just spent a ton of money on drawing paper, animation paper, portfolio case, etc, etc.  ARGHHHH!!!!   Art is just too damn expensive.

						   I saw a woman on Korean TV buying a mink coat.  It got me thinking about my views about fur, but before I do....  I've got nothing against vegetarians.  I couldn't be one cuz I like eating meat too much, but I've got the utmost respect for them.  I just don't like ones that get all righteous on me cuz I'm not one.  I think vegetarianism is a good thing.  It's healthier, it uses up less energy and resources, and Americans in general eat too much meat to begin with.  And if their reason for going vegetarian is for that energy thing, then well, I guess they have a reason to be righteous, though I would question how they lead the rest of their lives.  Anyway, if their reason for being vegetarian is because they "love animals" (which is a perfectly valid reason) then they have no right to be preachy.  (Ahem, Miss P. Anderson-Rock-to-be)  People that are vegetarian for "loving animals" should adjust that to "loving cute and/or furry animals."  Would they object to wearing cotton cuz the cottom farmers spray for cotton weevils?  Last I checked, even those pesky bugs were animals.  How about crop plants that take over land that used to have native plants and animals?  How can you love animals and not plants?  Plants want to survive just as much as animals.  They're just not cute and furry with cute and furry babies.  And what about not wearing leather (again, Miss Pam) yet would wear pleather and other synthetic fibers?  Nylon, polyester, and pleather come from plastic, which comes from oil.  Oil spills have been devastating to animals.  So has been oil fields.  So if you're a vegetarian cuz you love "cute and furry animals though you've probably never seen cows and pigs and chickens in real life" then hey, yay for you.  Just don't go telling people that they're wrong for not thinking the same way.  (BTW, the only reason I'd go vegetarian is if I have heart disease or something like that, or else if I was on a personal quest to use as little energy and resources as possible, though I'd probably have to get rid of my computer first, and you know that will never happen.)  Anyway, my views on fur?  I think as long as they come from farmed animals (like cows and sheep) then it's ok.  Well, it is somewhat wasteful of energy, but then we can start eating them too.  Mink burgers, anyone?  Hunting them for fur is wrong, I think, just because we're already doing enough crap to their habitat without having to add another predator to their list.

						   Tired, parents not home, home all alone with no food (well, nothing I feel like eating), and having to spend yet more money at K-Mart.  Yeah, the K-Mart in Chino Hills is closing, so they've been having a sale the past couple of months.  Today the prices got marked down even more, and it was mad.  Sooo messy, it's like vultures coming in to peck at a dying beast.  Anyway, since I'm paying health fees at SMC, I might as well use it.  I visited the school nurse last Thursday and she said that what I have is most likely not eczema but just really dry skin coupled with an allergic reaction.  So she recommended using a non-soap cleanser (like Cetaphil), a hypo-allergenic non-alcoholic moisturizer at night (the greasy kind), and if I have to put on sunblock, to get one that's PABA-free.  That and to stop the use of any make-up (though I don't think my lipstick and eye-liner will cause problems) and hot water when I wash my face.  I hope it works.  Anyway, all sales are final, so that just means that I've spent a lot of money at K-Mart getting soaps and other beauty products.  Yech.

						   I now have 500 sheets of 12 field animation paper.  Woah.  I'm planning on taking Animation II next term, so I figure it's a worthwhile investment.   urlLink Cartoon Colour Company  is an interesting store.  More more like a warehouse with an office storefront.  Just go up to the lady and tell her what you want.  No such thing as browsing.  I was reading my friend Erica's  urlLink blog  and it got me thinking.  Most of us are opposed to the war in Iraq.  But what if Bush had declared war on North Korea?  How would we react?  I mean, that's hitting really close to home.  But there's no doubt about it, Kim Jong Il is evil and the North Korean people, our people, are suffering.  And leaving them alone for the past 50 years hasn't helped matters.  After all, it's only a cease-fire.  The war never ended.  I don't have relatives in ol' buk-han, but they say 10 million South Koreans do.  And even if it means involving the South Korean army as well as the US Army and whoever else's army, and possibly having a huge bloodshed, I sort of think it's worth it to save the lives of our brethren.  But then, maybe it'd be easier just to send a few assassins in and kill off the government.  Do you realize that there are millions of people that were born, lived, and then died in indoctrination?  We need to take down that government soon.  Before the "great" leader decides to nuke the peninsula.

						   Our nude model today had an interesting body.  She seemed rather young (perhaps early to mid thirties?) but she had a really  huge  butt!  And lots of cellulite.  It made for interesting drawing.  Our focus today was "volume."  Perhaps that's why the teacher got this model.  Her boobs were really saggy, too.  I just didn't think that someone so young could have a body like that.  Maybe she a had couple of kids.  Or a dozen. :)

						   I do have to admit, my current group of Kaplan kids are really cool.  Perhaps it's because of the small size.  Or that 3/4 of them go to the same school.  I shared my stories of trying out for Jeopardy and stuff I did in high school.  It wasn't until class was over that I realized that these kids are only 16 or 17.  That means that I am   seven  years older  than them!  That's a lifetime in to them.  Heck, to me too at this point.  When I'm teaching, I feel like I'm still a teenager.  And it was really cool to when they got something.  (As opposed to just say "uh-huh" to get me to shut-up.)  I've been thinking more and more about teaching.  I'm still going to pursue this art thing (3d animation thing?) but I am thinking more and more about teaching art.  I think I would love to teach art in high school.  I've thought about elementary school, but only upper-graders.  But public schools are really suffering in the arts right now.  Unless I teach at a private school.  My cousin Jean goes to a private elementary school, and supposedly they have a really great arts program.  And private schools are good in that you don't have to have a teaching credential to teach.  But where ever I end up, I want to make sure I'm a professional artist first.  So my SMC journeys still seem valid.  My aunt told me that I'm really good with kids.  But like I said before, the only reason kids like me is that I actually pay attention to them.  And that I'm willing to play like a kid with them.  Kinda like how some dads play with their kids.  And it can be fun, sometimes, but for the most part, it's not something that I want to do all the time.  Like at church, all these girls want to hold and play with the two babies.  But I don't, not really.  They are really cute, but I just don't want to take care of them.  That's what really sucked about last Sunday.  My aunt and uncle come over to go look at land with my parents (ugh, don't get me started on that) leaving me to baby-sit their kid, James.  The 4-yr-old whom I recently helped out at his birthday party.  Now, he's a cute kid, and I like spending time with him, but I really don't like having to take care of him.  He's not old enough for us to "hang out."  I have to look out for him.  My aunt can call it "playing" all she wants, I'm still "baby-sitting."  So I really don't like the job is thrust upon me without even asking me.  And I know it'd be rude to correct her, but she basically wanted relief from care-taker duties so she dumped them on me.  WITHOUT ASKING.  Even at dinner that night (though they did treat) my uncle wanted James to sit next to me so that I can feed him and keep him occupied and make sure he doesn't get lost.  At least he can sorta feed himself.  But I had to get his utensils, arrange the bowls around him, and wrap the meat in ddukssam.  Just so my aunt and uncle could eat normally and talk with my parents (and drink soju).  Let's just say, it wasn't fun for me.  I was trying to eat, too.  (I'm glad at least that I didn't have to spoon-feed him.)  Y'know, thinking back, I remember whenever we went to someone's house, we'd just end up playing with our cousins.  It made sense cuz we were all kids.  I didn't think that them being older (by a bit) made them have to watch over us.  For the most part I remember having fun.  I was the youngest so I didn't do the things that my sister and female cousins did as well.  Uncle Danny (the one that's only 9 yrs older than me) asked me if I remembered him baby-sitting us when we were little.  I didn't think it was baby-sitting.  After all, he had fun playing on our Nintendo.  And I didn't have to have him escort me to the bathroom, or help me eat, or chase me around a restaurant.  'course, I was 6 or 7 at the time.  I mean, things should get better once no more little babies start coming into our family.  Though I think it's high time that I pass the buck to the younger kids.  I've paid my dues.  Now it's their turn.

						   It's been a mixed-up past few days.  For the most part it's been crappy.  I don't want to reveal too much here, but pretty much, my car no longer has a right side-view mirror.  Among other things.  And we have to spend a chunk of money to make the wheels go straight.  *sigh.  Yet, even amidst the crap of life, there are rays of sunshine.  It is true, God doesn't let us endure more than we can bear.  So a surprise piece of mail helped a lot with that chunk of money.  (On my defense, it wasn't completely my fault.  The other guy wasn't parked correctly.)  Also, I didn't know that my brakes were just about gone.  (No one told me brake pads last only about a year!)  I wouldn't have known it if I didn't see a mechanic.  I think they were exaggerating a bit, but one guy said it would have been metal-to-metal in an hour.  The highlight of my weekend: spending time with Erica.  She took me out to a belated birthday dinner at McCormick & Schmick's.  The food was pretty good, though I've tasted better for less.  I guess we were paying for the ambience.  'course, it's closer to her birthday than mine, so I think we'll have another belated birthday thing for her later this month.  The rains produced some more lush greenery again.  In the grand scheme of things, my life's crappiness doesn't compare to God's splendor.

						   I just finished watching  urlLink  Manor House   on PBS.  I really love those "House" series they've been having (1900 House, 1940's House, Frontier House) and I dare say that they've been getting bolder with each new series.  (And that "dare say" just popped out cuz the show took place in Britain and everyone had thick accents.)  Anyway, the premise of this show was that for three months, a family (the Oliff-Coopers) were going to live as a lord and lady of the manor, and then they'll have a dozen volunteers be the servants.  The whole thing is about the dynamic and the strict social heirarchy that existed in Edwardian England, between the upper class, as well as inside a manor home.  It was really fascinating.  Since the family isn't the stars of the series, they're seen as basically what masters are: arrogant, demanding, clueless, and all-around bastards.  And they're completely clueless to the fact that the servants feel that way about them.  I thought it was funny.  But then I felt sad for that family, cuz then in the real world, the viewers are going to hate them, and they were just behaving as anyone else would in their situation.  Anyway, soon the  Colonial House  project will start up soon (I know cuz I saw the audition notice on the website awhile back.), but we probably won't be able to see that one 'til next summer.

						   Well, I finally made the trip to  urlLink Pearl Paint  cuz I heard wonders about their prices.  Eh.  S'okay.  It's not any better or worse than  urlLink The Art Store  or  urlLink Utrecht .  (All the art people know what I'm talking about.  The rest of you could probably care less.  Or maybe not.  I mean, a lot of people I know like to do art stuff.  Or wish they could do art stuff.)  Anyway, there are only two Pearl Paint stores, one in LA (Pico and La Cienega) and on in Huntington Beach.  Well, for those of you that understand LA driving, Pico and La Cienega are really  crappy  streets.  They're large and busy-as-heck.  (That's the reason for my previous I-hate-LA-driving rant.)  I'm really starting to get the hang of traditional animation.  I would really like to show it to my two faithful readers, but it would require too much time and effort, not to mention a faster online connection.  I don't even have them on video tape.  I should do that.  I do have to say, there's a reason why I like 3D more than traditional.   In-betweening sucks.   For those of you non-animation-savvy folks, that means that the head animator draws all the major poses, and then the runty assistant has to draw all the frames in between the key poses.  So, for example, the head animator draws the person standing, then sitting, and the in-betweener has to draw the person's knees bending, bending, bending, until he gets to the sitting position.  Yeah, it's a sucky thing to do.  Now, if I had an assistant, then I wouldn't have to do all that.  :)  Wouldn't that be funny.  "Teacher, can you get all of us students a couple of assistants each?"  But I do have to say, what I like about traditional (meaning pencil on paper) is that if you want your character to squish or twist or whatnot, you can just draw him that way.  With 3D, you have to set it up so that he can do all that.  And that requires tons of work.  It means that before you can animate a single frame, you have to think about every single move your guy is going to make, and then set him up so that he can do that.  (That's why those Pixar people can churn out "outtakes" and mini-movies with the regular characters after the main movie is done.  The characters are already set up, you just have to move them around and then render.)  I've probably bored y'all.  Eh.  It's my journal.  But please come back!  All two o'ya!

						   Ugh.  I  hate  LA driving.  Remind me never ever ever  ever  drive in downtown LA during the hours of 4 to 7 pm.  And during today's drawing class, I wasn't as "on" as I was on Tuesday.  Maybe cuz I was a half-hour late (c'mon, it's a 5-hr class), but I think it was also due to the models not being very dynamic.  I just want to be on time next week cuz then it's proof that I  can  be on time, cuz I really need to be on time the week after since we have a field trip.  I'm sooo tired.  Makes me think back to the days when I had no class to teach, no school to attend.  I mean, sure, I was bored out of my mind, but I was never tired. :)  Never happy, ain't I?

						   I gotta watch out or I'm going to develop a (bigger) swelled head.  My teacher complimented me a lot in class (costumed figure drawing) today.  He said that I steadily improve every week.  I think some of that is due to the other drawing class I'm taking (figure in motion, where every other week we have nudes), but I think a lot of that is due to just getting back in the swing of things.  I mean, yeah, my drawing has improved over stuff I did in Berkeley, but when I started this class this semester, I hadn't done any figure drawing in 2.5 years.  I was rusty and it showed.  It took me a few weeks to get back to where I was before.  But Doug (the teacher) saw it as improvement.  Also, (forgive me for my arrogance) I think I am one of the best, if not  the  best, draftsman of the class.  That only tells you how crappy a lot of the students are.  Many people have never taken an art class before, nevermind a figure drawing class.  You see why it's too easy to get a swelled head.  The drawing ability of the other class is much better (I think because it's actually titled "advanced figure in motion").  Anyway, I just have to realize that I should seek to make my drawings better than my own, rather than of others'.  Reading  urlLink Christine's Blog  makes me want to have a pet. :Þ

						   Back in school... and already memories of Spring Break are becoming a blur.  I was late to class... again.  I just couldn't pull myself out of bed earlier, and then Dad had another computer question.  I mean, I'm glad to help and all, but honestly, most of those questions are stuff I don't know off the bat and I have to find out, and that is something he can do himself!  I think I became a crutch for him.  Before, he was forced to figure out everything by himself.  But now, one little thing goes wrong, and it's "JEEEEAAANNNAAAA---YAAAAAHHH."  "Yes, Dad?"  "I clicked upload and it's not working!"  "Dad, the program froze, you have to refresh the page and start over."  "How do you do that?"  Sigh.  "Here, Dad."  "How can you change this to get rid of the background?"  "Well, Dad, you probably want to use Photoshop instead of Paint."  "Photoshop?  Where's that?"  "Just go to 'All Programs'...."  You get the idea.  Really simple stuff.  Which only makes me realize why basic computer classes are so popular.  Most people see the computer as such a mysterious thing that only an "expert" can tell them how to use.

						   Happy Easter!  (Um... belated)  The women's ministry presentation went well.  I actually felt nervous (I wasn't all rehearsal) but I didn't screw up, at least.  It was really beautiful.  I checked out the video of the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar.  It's an interesting version.  Because Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice didn't want to say for certain that Jesus was either God or not, it's a very humanistic view of the Passion, the main character being Judas.  It's rather interesting inexploring why Judas would betray someone he loved so much.  Well, the film didn't show Judas' love so much.  Anyway, so here's my question to y'all.  Do you think if you were there that you would betray or deny Jesus?  We could all say, heck no, but really, back then, the Jews were expecting Armageddon and for Jesus to set up a physical kingdom on Earth.  You're all excited cuz the Romans have been oppressing you for years, and you expect paradise to return.  Then the guy you believed would do that is not only refusing to wage war, but up and gets arrested and crucified.  We have the benefit of viewing this event through thousands of years of study and examination, and keeping our focus on a heavenly kingdom as opposed to an earthly one.  But back then... I don't know how I would have reacted.  I'm just glad I live in this century.

						   The people in my class at my old church in Berkeley ( urlLink KCPC ) are sending "annual update" e-mails about what's been going on in their lives.  Some people have shocked.  I'm amazed at the number of people going back to school, though.  (One thing that bothers me is that it's always the same ol' people responding, and I would like to know what's going on with other people that I knew but don't have their e-mail addresses.)  Anyway, before I respond, I'd have to think about my life first.  I've rather avoided the old KCPC group, scattered as they are.  Well, last year I did that cuz I was going through issues and I retreated into my shell and only associated with the closest friends.  (Meaning a lot of peripheral friends got cut off.)  Anyway, my life hasn't gotten much better or worse.  Sure, I've gotten wiser, but who the heck wants to read about that?  (Oh, sorry readers....)  One big major life lesson:  Relationships are hard work and if you depend on them to fix your problems, you're in for a major screwin'.  So why have a relationship?  I think because they're like kids.  It's fulfilling.  So they say.  But you still have diarrhea diaper changes and 4-am feedings.  Makes me wonder why I want one so much.

						   Well, my parents are back.  I'm such a baby.  I'm sleeping so erratically lately.  Part of that is due to my watching the news 'til too late.  I'm glad that the major fighting of this war is over, but I wonder how things will be afterwards in Iraq.  Will they still hate us?  Gotta hand it to the Muslims.  Some Christians may hate Jews but don't profess it.  But for some strict Muslim sects, anti-Semitism is practically dogma.  And I think as long as Muslims hate Jews, and Christians for liking Jews, there won't be an end to terrorism.  Unless, of course, it's nothing about religion and all about power and money, which most likely it always is....

						   Sooo tired... but...  SPRING BREAK !!!!!!!!!!!  Wooooohooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!  Life's just passing by way too quickly.  Months go by and I realize I haven't heard from a friend.  I'm approaching my third holiday at church (fourth, if you count Valentine's Day) and Easter by far is the biggest deal.  I'm part of a women's presentation (body worship, not quite sure of the title, but it starts, "This is my body given for you, this is the cup that holds the blood of the new covenant").  We had practice last night from 10 to 11!  I also had a long chat with my friend after.  It started after I got freaked out listening to the  urlLink Coast to Coast  radio show.  They were having people call in with scary things that have happened to them, and I get too easily freaked out by stories of ghosts, supernatural warnings, and even gnomes.  Anyway, being in the house alone... well, I got freaked out and called my friend up.  (The only other person I know who would have been up at that hour.)  Well, I stopped being freaked... and got grossed out instead. :)

						   Ever since I saw the dinner theater production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat last  urlLink February , I have been somewhat obsessed with getting the soundtrack.  Not buying, per se, but looking for mp3s or else library copies.  The Donny Osmond production was on TV recently, and it's pretty good.  Eh, if anything, I'll be on the lookout for a cheap used CD.  I did managed to download a couple of songs but I don't know who the singer is.  I think it's Michael Damien, in which case, he's not that good.  So much school supplies!  I think I'll have to look into getting (or making) a cheap light box.

						   I splurged today and spent $3 on my lunch.  Hahahahaha.  Yep,  splurged .  I know this habit is so incredibly bad for me, but I've been eating those 99-cent burgers for lunch (on school days), coupled with a Coke (cuz of the caffeine value).  I don't know how else to save money on lunch (other than brown-bagging it, which is sorta hard to do cuz I'm always running late in the mornings).  I just hope that I don't end up gaining too many inches so that I can't fit into my bridesmaid dress.  Exercise?  Umm... sure.  I think my weight control tactic so far has been, "eat something fatty only once a day, and have a bowl of cereal and some bread later."  How's it working for me?  Not well.  I'm not sure about weight, since some of my pants are a little looser, but I have zero-point-one energy.  Really, once I get home, I just conk out.  The only way I can function at all seems to be through caffeination.  I suppose it's a vicious cycle, not having enough energy to exercise so I can get more energy....

						   I do have to admit, getting out of Berkeley definitely lessened my liberalism.  But I am not a right-wing conservative!  Recently I caught the Woody Allen movie  Everyone Says I Love You  on TV (it's cute, a musical comedy, with an ensemble cast including Alan Alda, Goldie Hawn, Drew Barrymore, Julia Roberts, and Natalie Portman).  Alan Alda's son suddenly turned into an extreme right-wing conservative, to the dismay of his liberal Democrat father.  Anyway, some of the things that the son spouted was school prayer and and no gun control.  And no, I don't support forced school prayer, and I do support gun control.  Perhaps even banning firearms among civilians altogether.  And even though I'm a Christian, I don't think forced school prayer does anything except alienate those that are confused or deciding.  It's kind of a tough subject for me: evangelism.  I mean, Christ commands it, but whenever I try to do it, it backfires.  And a lot of it backfires.  So I think that forcing school prayer doesn't help our cause any better than the non-Christians.  Just a thought.

						   Wow, sorry, I kept on forgetting to post stuff while online.  My apologies to my two faithful readers. :)  I've had some interesting rants and whatnot about various people and things, but I'm not in the mood now, so I'll do that later.  It's been semi-crazy this past week prepping my parents for their trip.  And now I have the house to myself for ten days!  Though I still have school and work, and the only difference now is that I have to fix my own dinners.  I'm listening to Dr. Laura on the radio, and boy, she's very abrupt and compassion-less.  She makes a lot of sense, but dang, Dr. Phil has more heart.  I don't like seeing people away at airports.  I feel like I'm being left behind.  But... I couldn't go along.  Money, schedule, etc, prevents me from doing so.  I definitely want to do more travelling in the future.

						   I wish there was a Photoshop for my face.  The newest version (7.0) has a tool called "the healing brush" which is useful for getting rid of specks and dust on photos.  I recently used it to erase the pimples on my face for a project.  (Linky later)  Wish I could do that for my real face.  Anyway, love the Santa Monica weather!  Lack of bible study today enables me to just hang out, work on my animations, prepare my portfolio.  It's almost sad that the semester's almost over and I won't be back 'til Fall.  Oh well, summer projects await!

						   Yep, it was above a hundred, though by the time I left for work, it was 98.  Speaking of which, the kids were more rowdy than usual.  I had to even give this one boy a "U" for behavior.  I'm guessing the heat was making them ornerier than usual.  Heck, I felt more short-tempered.  But I think that was due in part to them whining more than usual, less participation than usual, and finishing what I thought would take the whole time quicker so that we were left with a chunk of time in which they wanted to play games, only the game took on more vindictive turns.  All due to the heat, I tell you!  Oh, in case you haven't noticed, I added a comment link to my blog now.  I don't think there's really any need for it, but I guess it's for my ego.  So use it, folks!!!  Oh, also, now that the temperatures are warm enough, we can start swimming.  My first day of it today!  Oh boy, I had lost so much stamina and technique.  Well, what little there is.  My mom's reverted back to bad stroke habits.  Kaela, if you're reading this, you're needed back for coaching duties, stat!

						   I can't help but notice -- the quality of my drawings is directly related to the quality of the models.  And what affects quality?  Mostly, what they're wearing.  Well, that and the kind of poses they take.  And as much as this martial artist guy sounds good, he's not.  Blah.  (We're taking a break and what am I doing?  Blogging!  Dang, no life!)  So... going back to my drooling... er, admiring of certain male models:  I don't know if I admire those bodies because society told me they were ideal.  Or else if it's biological.  Or a matter of personal taste.  I think it a bit of all three.  I mean, mainly because society tells me to admire burly, hairy-chested men, and I don't.  Maybe it's cuz I'm Asian.  I don't know too many hairy-chested Asian men.  It seems kinda gross to me, actually.  But then, most women nowadays seem to prefer smooth-chested.  I just keep reading about women drooling over hairy-chested men in romance novels.  (Yes, I am admitting to reading smut... occasionally.)  My apologies to my male readers.  (Or... is it giving you hints?)

						   Yet another observation:  In the Radio Disney version of Britney Spears' "Oops I Did It Again," they omitted the line, "I'm not that innocent."  Now... yeah, it's a bit  risque , but I think it's mostly harmless.  Then again, I haven't heard them air "Slave 4 U" so maybe they're just covering all their bases.  Anyway, I thought that "innocent" line wasn't any worse than the rest of the lyrics.  Or maybe they just didn't want to encourage people, esp little girls, to not want to be innocent and pure.  Eh.

						   I can't believe that people would take their elementary-school-aged kids (and younger) to see  The Matrix Reloaded .  I mean, for an R-rated movie, the sex scene was pretty graphic.  There was a ton of violence.  And yet, in the row ahead of us, there was a couple with their kid, who seemed no older than six, or even five.  What is wrong with these people?  What, they can't get a baby-sitter so they're going to expose their innocent children to graphic violence and sex (where they show pretty much everything!)?  As for the movie itself... it was interesting.  Not as fun as the first mainly cuz it was a mind-trip and it felt real (like, what if the Matrix really existed?), but in this second one, it was about the war and the role of The One in the war.  So it felt more like a sci-fi war movie.  Though they did focus more on faith than regular sci-fi movies.  Anyway, one summer blockbuster down.  More to go.

						   A few observations:  Muscular, tall men are a lot nicer to draw than pudgy, short ones.  Duh, right?  Is it really shallow to find tall, well-muscled, lean guys really attractive?  (Meaning, finding them that aren't as unattractive.)  I mean, it's only natural... I would think.  I mean, the range of faces on what is attractive is pretty wide, but for bodies?  Well, maybe I'm acting like a guy (or else, every other girl out there is in denial), but when it comes to attractive bodies, there is pretty much a tight standard.  I like that some artist models are also dancers.  Actors come in dozens of different shapes, but dancers come in pretty much one kind.  Niiiiiiiiiice.  :)  Okay, I'll stop drooling now.

						   Mmm... ate a lot today....  My summer work situation is so iffy... it's driving me nuts.  I asked the director today if during the summer there's something I could do, but I don't think our neighborhood's too into tutors and summer classes.  There aren't enough Asians to drive their kids to score 1600's or get straight A's.  I don't get why any kid would voluntarily take math and reading and stuff like that over the summer, especially since for the same money you could go to a day camp for something fun.  But eh, I know which side my bread's buttered.  I really hate the valley.  It was too freakin' hot today.

						   I got my baby back.  Too bad she hasn't been handled much since.  (I'm... talking about my computer.  Heh heh.  I got a new hard drive and now it's faster!  Yippee!)  I've got a long-weekend this weekend cuz school's out on Friday and work's closed on Monday.  Sooooo... now what?  If anything, I guess I can spend that time catching up on movies and stuff, but it's too easy to hole myself and withdraw from people.  Sucky.  I should go seek out other people who have the days off.  It's kinda funny, but I feel like I'm surrounded by Republicans.  I think now more than ever I know I am a staunch... moderate.  Cop-out?  Perhaps.  But liberals are too illogical and conservatives are too cold-hearted.  I'm a pragmatist, and the only reason why I don't do more for politics is because it's too damn hard to keep up with the Bushes.  My mom's going crazy at home right now, cooking and whatnot.  She tends to go overboard for guests.  She has to constantly tell herself that not that many people are coming, and more than once I have to "veto" yet another dish she feels she has to make.  There are 2 meat dishes, 2 fish dishes, about 3 vegetable dishes, fried jun, soup, and dduk and fruit for dessert.  If I didn't have school today, I would have been frying from morning 'til evening.  And there are only about nine people coming!  It's chu-do-shik, the day to honor the death and life of my dad's grandfather.  Well, at least we'll have some good food left over. :)

						   Here's a funny story:  whenever my car radio blasts too much static, I  reboot  it.  Yep, I turn it off, wait for the non-existent antenna to fold down, and then turn it on again.  And it works!!!  I just thought it was funny that my car radio needs a reboot now and then.  Another story,  not for the feint-hearted males :  I think my cycles are finally getting regular, after 12+ years.  At least, I think it's regular.  But the last few times have been the only times there wasn't 3 or 4 months in between.  Maybe I've just been too stressed all those years.  But it doesn't quite make sense since last year I wasn't all that stressed either.  Well, except about worrying about my future.  Is that it?  Or maybe it's my lack of constant exposure to other female hormones.  I've got no roommates and my mom's going through "the change."  Whatever it is, I'm not sure if I like it any better or worse, since all in all the number of days of actual "event" is still the same.  Ah well, better for my health, right?  (I hope so, at least.)

						   Today's model was one we had before, but she wasn't nude then.  She's an old woman, and just looking at her reminds me of how thin my grandmother got in the hospital when she was sick and dying.  The only difference is that this woman was thin everywhere except for her hips.  She was rather extremely pear-shaped.  Sometimes I feel stuck, like I'm running and running and going nowhere.  I think that partially stems from other people in my life are out doing stuff.  Well, at least working full-time, starting their careers, pursuing higher education, or even settling down with someone.  Even though I'm only 24, I feel like I'm gonna blink, and suddenly I'm 30, the world has passed me by, and I'm exactly the same.  I keep saying to myself, after this month, after this year, after I finish this....  I gotta slap myself and say, no, you're not stuck, you have goals, you have dreams, and most of all, you have faith that God is leading you somewhere.  It's just hard to gauge the journey when the landscape's bleak.

						   Brace yourself, I've got a lot on my mind....  Last Friday I went to the  urlLink Otis Art College  senior show, and booooy.  Well, I mean, there are some that sucked, some that were spectacular, and some were so-so... but more experienced (i.e. better) than me.  Though with more training and experience, perhaps I can catch up.  But here's what sucks: I gotta do more than be as good as everyone else.  In order to succeed in this biz, I have to be better than the average-joe-digital-artist.  And... well, I'm not sure if I can be that.  I look around at SMC, and there are sooo many students, and so many of them want to do what I want to do.  Let's just say that I'm feeling apprehensive.  Does God intend me for success in this area?  On Mother's Day, we went over to my aunt's to have dinner with my grandparents and other relatives.  We had salmon steaks and some halibut, and mmm mmmm mmmmm, that salmon was gooooood.  All the food was really good.  Luckily, the little cousins, when together, can now play together with very general supervision.  So I wasn't roped into doing that.  I did, however, help out my 4th grader cousin with her homework -- a poster advertising her favorite book.  Well, she did wait until the last minute, and a lot of her drawings and letterings were... sloppy.  But the way that my aunt just yelled at her for that.  Dang.  She got so pissed and basically took over and told her what to do.  Like a really bossy art director.  But all I could help but think is that she's only 9 years old, and yes, the quality of the work isn't as great as it could be, but as long as she was trying, and she was proud of her work, I figure to just let her be.  My aunt could have just said, hey those letters are crooked, hey, that's hard to read, hey, that doesn't sound right, etc.  But instead, she just berated her, and my cousin just shrank.  My aunt's a fashion designer, so she's used to perfection in design and presentation, etc.  But the way she was acting... boy, she was so  cold .  I remember in elementary school people starting reports and other major projects the night before.  I must admit that I've been guilty of that sometimes.  But... well, you learn.  Or you could be like me... so arrogant that I couldn't stand the thought of not having the best report, the best-looking project, etc.  Then you learn to be more careful, to put more thought, to put more care into things.  You learn to draw things in pencil first, and then when you're satisfied, you ink it in.  You learn.  I mean, I know my aunt wants my cousin to get a good grade, but if that's not her desire, then yelling at her isn't going to make her want it any more.  Well, that's what I think....

						   Field trip today!   urlLink Broad Art Foundation,  a cool place with some kooky works.  If you want to visit, just call ahead.  Fridays are open to anyone, the rest of the week, you have to be an educator.  We spent about 2.5 hours drawing on the roof with a grand view of the city and beach.  I had a hat, but dang it, my arms weren't covered, so I now have brown arms (on the top sides) and a slightly darker face/neck from the reflected light.  Summer is upon us?  Soon?  Ech.  Hope it doesn't get too hot too soon.

						   OMG, that Buffy was extremely gratuitous!  Dang!  No wonder my guy friend really liked it!  I've become a rather Photoshop junkie, though due partially to my Dad.  But it's fun.  I don't know if I want to do it as a career, but considering that I don't find it boring, and sometimes I even find it enjoyable, it's a definite back-up if I don't end up at Pixar or PDI or even Sony.  It's kinda funny, but I'm even finding traditional animation fun.  Cuz whatever you want, as long as you can draw it, it can happen.  Not like 3D where it takes forever just to enable them to move their legs.  But then, in-betweening sucks.  I don't know which sucks more, in-betweening or 3D character set-up.  Umm... sorry, shop talk.  Anyway, I'll put up my stuff on my website... when I get around to it.

						   So I came to school early in hopes of doing some extra credit work... and I forgot my book!!!  Argh!!!  I was reading Christine's  urlLink blog , and it was funny hearing about her being dependent on calculators.  It reminds me how geeky I am cuz I like solving math problems for fun.  Okay, okay, I'm not  that  geeky.  Actually, I had to solve a lot of SAT math problems cuz of teaching for Kaplan and tutoring.  But it's really cool to have a problem, a diagram, or some word problem, and you don't know how to start but you tinker around 'til you find the solution.  And then you get this satisfying feeling of a job well done.  Then my laundry piles and dust bunnies stand up and applaud.  I think it's something that's been a challenge to me, actually, cuz the way I approach a math problem isn't the same way that the kids do, and it's my job to help them solve the problem, not for me to act all geeky and go around yelling, "The answer is B!"  Yeah, geeky.  I'm so ashamed.  Well, no, I'm not.  I'm a geek and I'm proud of it!!!  On a side, note, would you, by small, yet faithful readership, prefer that I put a comment thing on this blog?

						   Today's model was   fantastic  !!!  He's a guy named David, fabulously in shape, and able to hold the  best  poses!  Really elongated and expressionistic.  When the class passed a box to give him a "tip" (SMC, I guess, pays their models horribly) I even chipped in a buck.  If you, my faithful readers (whom I count to be about 5 I guess) ever want to see these drawings, just come on over.  One of these days I'm going to scan a lot of these drawings and put them on my website.  Oh, speaking of which, sorry that my new  urlLink flash website  is broken.  I have to do some de-bugging and figure out why certain pages are not loading.  But suffice it to say, you're not missing much.  I'll post on here when it's updated.

						   So I get these stupid pop-ups telling me that my computer is leaking my IP address and that I should go to their site to get a program to block these pop-ups.  The funny thing is, the only pop-ups I get are ones advertising for anti-pop-up programs.  Ech.  Anybody know how to keep my IP from "leaking"?  I went to my church's graduation banquet tonight.  Reminds me of the one I went to with them when I graduated from high school.  Waaaay back in 1997.  It's funny going back to the church I used to attend as a high schooler.  And wow, it's already been seven months since I've been there.  Wow.  But I do really like it.  Maybe it's cuz the church is small yet of mostly my age set, but I feel really at home there.  Now if only I could not be late to those 9:15 am services.  Sooooooo early!!!  Job sitch still sucks, though I do need to do more on my part.  I can ask God all I want for a job, but if I don't go looking for one, then He's not just going to drop one in my lap.  If only, eh?  4th of July camping trip next weekend!  Fun!  I just hope I won't get too dark and end up looking like a brown log with a bridesmaid dress on.

						    Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix ... done!!!  Well, that's one benefit to being jobless.  Pleeeenty of time to read.  Dang, 870 pages!  The book is so much more dark and gloomy than the previous books.  In fact, it seems that the books just got progressively darker.  If the next two books are darker than this book... well, 'tain't no guessing how kids will react.  But they are so much more intelligent than other children's books.  I mean, it's not like kids aren't used to death and violence.  A lot of other children's books out there are just too hunky-dory.  Yet... these books are scarier than the R. L. Stein "Goosebumps" series.  Well, alright, those books were rather wimpy scary to begin with (and yes, I have read them, due to my then 12-yr-old cousin) but I do wonder if perhaps kids do need something more cotton candy to escape to.  But then, Harry Potter's certainly less scary than fairy tales. :)

						    Comments!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Cool, thanks guys!!!  Oh, and thanks for your congrats!  I mean, I don't think it's too difficult to get into the Academy, but hey, I did put a lot of work into that stupid portfolio, so why don't I just make myself feel better and say that it's tough to get in. :)  (I think, from what I've gathered, as long as you've done a lot of figure drawing, you're in.)  Now, on to more important matters:  I am not in a love crisis.   Okay, y'know how among friends (or at least among girl friends) we talk about who's cute and would you go out with him and other such nonsense?  Well, I was doing that with you, my readership!  I just mentioned a guy that I had met who I thought was cute.  (And the more I type "cute" the more I sound like some junior high schoolgirl.)  That whole thing about him wanting to be a missionary just made me think--  in general  -- of how I would feel about marrying a missionary.  Because if I do (and I'm not talking about this particular guy, just about missionary guys in general), then basically it would mean that I too would have to be a missionary and move out to the mission field and raise my kids out there, etc.   And ... then I was wondering about whether or not I would be willing to be a missionary if God led me to be one.  Marrying one is definitely leading me to be one.  Anyway, I'm not sure how much choice I have in the matter of choosing a future mate.  But if I did have some choice in it, because of my lack of willingness at the moment to be a missionary, I think I would choose not to hook up with one.  But I believe that God does have a plan (at least for the major stuff like career and family) so if He chose a missionary husband for me... well, I can only wonder if I would submit to that decision.  Comments?  BTW, did anybody read that bunny story that I put the link onto for June 21?  I just found it to be really sad yet heartwarming.  And it made me feel guilty for not taking care of my aunt's dog better (we're dog-sitting).  And though I've never had a consistent pet (none lived longer than a few months with us) I've seen people that get really devoted to their pets.  Anyway, it kinda made me wish I too had a pet that I could love like a kid.  Though... maybe the others dying like that is telling me that I'm cursed.  Or at least not a good pet-owner.

						   It sucks that in this world, beauty comes in expensive bottles, and so many people are buying it.  I mean, unfortunately, in this world, for a woman to succeed, she needs to have certain standards of appearance.  It's almost funny being looked at upon with pity by the girls at the make-up counter.  At least I got a free eyebrow-shaping.  I mean, I do wish that my skin would clear up (or at least stop itching), but it's been such a struggle most of my adolescent and post-adolescent life, that I almost think of it as my thorn in the side that God has put.  Either that, or else He's telling me to take care of myself better.  J   So there's this guy that I met, and I'm thinking, he's cute, he's Christian, I wonder....  But then I learn that he wants to be a missionary, and then I'm thinking, oh, that's bad.  He loves the Lord too much.  And then I stop myself.  What?  Love the Lord  too  much?!?  Can that ever be possible?  If anything, we don't love the Lord  enough .  And I'm automatically crossing him off my list cuz he wouldn't make a "proper" husband with the 9-to-5 job and 2.5 kids out in the suburbs with a white picket fence?  Okay, stop right there, there's  nothing  going on here.  We're not dating, it's not even considered, we've only talked briefly, I don't want any gossip or speculation here.  It's one of those things you think about when you're single, when you meet someone of the opposite gender, you size him/her up and wonder if this person might be  The One .  The One Who Will Stop the Machines and Win the War for Zion.     Um... no.  Anyway, it was something that I hadn't thought too much about.  Would I be willing to lead a "difficult" life if the Lord leads me to it?  I mean, I'm somewhat of a coward, so I don't see myself going out in the world doing missions, but what if the husband God leads me to wants to do it?  I really admire missionaries and those who forsake a comfortable life so that they can be in the trenches for God.  This is too mind-boggling.  Perhaps it's good that I'm single.  BTW, I am  in  the Academy!  Woo-hoo!  There are some conditions attached to it, but I hope that doesn't mean that I'm limited in the classes I can take.  After all, I'm not there for a certificate.  I'm there to gain job skills and improve my portfolio.  I don't want to take some of those classes that they want me to take.  For those of you that are willing, could you pray for my job situation?  Bills are mounting and I am desperate.

						   Acgh.  My interview at Best Buy went well.  I think.  You never know.  I had to "sell" the ball-point pen to the interviewer, and I thought I did a good enough job.  I even made myself look goody-goody.  Sigh.  Here's hopin'.  Anyway, yay I'm in Purgatory!  Too bad I don't really believe in Purgatory.  I would rock as a Catholic.  Still no letter from the Academy.  I got shoes and earrings today to complete my bridesmaid ensemble.  My mom got her outfit, too.  She's lookin' pretty good!  However, it's only reminded me that I need to go down a dress size.  Her size is just too close to mine.  But all this shopping is only reminding me how much I need a job.

						   Sigh.  I think the  urlLink Academy  is giving me trouble.  I got a message from them yesterday with the portfolio committee's recommendation, which is to take more classes.  I don't know if that means I'm in.  I mean, I've already taken a ton of art classes (and perhaps my not submitting a transcript, which I couldn't have done in time, might have affected their view of me) and they want me to take more.  Sigh.  I mean, I took  Advanced  Figure in Motion this semester, and they want me to take the  Beginning  Figure in Motion class.  Should my having taken the class and passing it with a good grade show that I don't need the beginning class???  But then, the lady said that it was recommended and not required... and basically I have to read through the letter which I'm sure explains it all better.  I waited for the mail today before coming to school to see if the letter was there... and it wasn't.  So, it'll most likely come tomorrow.  I should hope.  I just want to know, am I in or what?  Cuz I can't take the advanced animation class unless I'm in.  Sigh, sigh, siiiiiiiigh.  Hey  urlLink Erica , you ain't the only unhappy one.  Life just sucked last week, it kinda sucked the week before, and it's starting to suck this week.  (And I hope you don't mind that I put a link to your blog.)  Gotta go.

						   Stupid blogger, not working....  Anyway, I'll elaborate when I get home what has been going on the past week.  Right now I'm at school, just finished recording my final animation project to tape, which I couldn't do on Friday.  And I had to wait  2 frickin' hours  for someone to finish so I can record my dinky 8-second animation.  Stupid.  Anyway, I wasn't expecting to stay at school this long.  I was going to leave around 6:30 to avoid the traffic.  Well, it's almost 8, so yeah, I've definitely avoided traffic.  Stupid.

						   Wow, it's been awhile since I've stayed up 'til 8:30 in the morning.  But that's when I went to bed this morning.  I then got up at 12:30 to get ready and go to school.  So why was I up so late?  Putting together my portfolio.  What made it take so long?  Cuz I had the brilliant idea (given to me by a teacher, actually) to photocopy and shrink some of my drawings to fit them on one big sheet.  But instead of using a photocopier, I used my dad's scanner, which does a pretty good reproduction.  Anyway, here's the hard part: the scanner bed is only about 9 x 12, and many of my drawings are bigger than that.  So what did I do?  I scanned parts of it, and then cut them up and taped them together.   Lame.   But eh, what else am I going to do.  Luckily, everything was black and white, so I didn't use up the precious color ink.  Yeeesssss, my preciousssssss.  It truly is.  We ran out of yellow awhile ago, so my magazine cover piece ended up with a purple model, and then a couple of days ago, while my dad fiddle with the cartridge, we lost the blue.  So when he copied korean yellow pages cover to test it out... it came out looking pink.  So he bought a new cartridge, and all I can think is, I think there is a lot more yellow in this world than red or blue.  So it probably won't be long 'til we run out of yellow again.  Argh!  This is something to consider: when buying a printer, get one w/ separate color ink cartridges.  BTW,  urlLink Craigslist  rocks for selling stuff.  At least, I hope my microwave got sold.  It's such a pain dealing w/ the sale of stuff 400 miles away.  I should have just sold it when I left, either to Christine or to someone else.  Eh, what do I know, I thought I was just making things convenient.  Who knew it wasn't?

						   I should be paying attention in class... and she did just show us how to do something nifty with Photoshop... but I can't help it.  There's a reason why I chose the computer that's at the opposite corner of the room from the teacher's desk.  :)  Do you read blogs of people you don't know?  I can't help it and I've been reading some of the more famous ones, like Wil Wheaton dot net ( urlLink WWDN ), and the Baghdad Blogger ( urlLink Where is Raed? ), as well as one I just picked at random from the Blogs of Note list from Blogger, by this woman named Anne ( urlLink AnneCentral ).  I just got caught up on "Where is Raed?" but that's only the past couple of months.  It's really fascinating to read about the war from this Iraqi's point of view.  Oop... gotta go before the teacher catches me.

						   It sucks, but in about 9 days, I will be completely unemployed.  Sucks.  My friend suggested I go for a retail job because despite its low pay and thankless hardships, it would be steady with flexible hours which I will need come Fall semester.  I am tempted to agree.  Though there was a couple of months awhile back when I tried applied to what I think was a gazillion retail stores, I didn't get a single reply.  I think they see me as over-educated for those jobs, and that I'll bolt the minute something better comes along.  And they're probably right, but hey, that's what  everybody  in retail does.  Or at least what all the grunts do.  I feel so desperate for money.  I have to keep reminding myself that it is God who gives jobs and also takes them away.  So, why God did you take this job away???  I also found out my neighborhood Kinko's is not open 24-hrs.  Which means that I shouldn't be up typing this blog, but should be asleep so I can wake up early enough to go there before driving to school.  I'm looking at various tutor positions listed on monster.com, and they're not that pleasant.  I'm half-tempted just to put up flyers at local korean markets.  It's gotta be better than what's being offered out there.

						   I feel like such a girl....  (Umm... men, I think this is your cue to skip this entry.   Well, actually, you could just skip the italicized section.   J  )   So tonight our family (extended) went out to celebrate my grandfather's birthday.  He's 82 or 83.  I forget which.  Anyway, the restaurant was called  urlLink Amazon Churrascaria , and boooy, it's a lot of meat!  Basically, it's a buffet, but while you're at the table, waiters come by with skewers of meat (that was cooked over an open fire) and then cut you slices right there on the table.  Soooo much food!  Anyway, there was this one really cute waiter there.  He was Brazilian, with blond hair and a really great smile.  And I really liked his accent.  It sounded like a Mexican accent but more... smooth.  I admit I flirted a bit (well, tried to, consider how terrible I am at it), and it was rather fun.  Whenever he came around, I got whatever he was offering, 'til I was so full that I couldn't accept it anymore.  Anyway, he taught me how to say "thank you."  Munto obrigado.  To which you reply, di nada.  It's weird, though, cuz awhile ago, I would have thought that he looked too old.  (He seemed to be in his mid to late twenties.)  But, well, perhaps as I have gotten older, my tastes have also gotten older?  Even during college, I found younger-looking guys more attractive.  Wow, I guess that means I'm getting older.    So during this family gathering, it got me thinking more and more about my default "baby-sitter" status that my aunts seemed to have given me.  I think it was due to my actually having played with the kids not too long after I graduated from Cal.  That and my willingness to baby-sit for pay.  But the first time that was foisted on me (i.e. w/o my consent) was at my aunt's wedding last year.  Because of that, I spent the second half of the wedding not being able to talk with other people, or watch people dance, or even watch whatever was going on.  I found myself really resenting that.  But like the wuss I am, I never spoke up.  Instead, I did the cowardly approach and just avoided my aunts whenever I went to family gatherings.  And whenever the kids were foisted on me, I just foisted them on someone else.  I don't know if they get it yet, but lately, like tonight, they haven't foisted their kids on me.  My Aunt Min, the one w/ the 4-yr-old whom I helped out at his birthday party earlier this year, is most notorious.  It's cuz her husband is working full-time and going to grad school part-time, so he's never home, and she's alone with the kid while she also works full-time.  Whereas my Aunt Karen, who has a 3.5-yr-old and a 9-yr-old, has her husband, my grandparents, my Uncle Bruce and his wife, and their 14-yr-old kid, to help her out with the mothering duties.  So Aunt Min tends to foist her kid off on me whenever we're together cuz I think she misses the adult company.  I wonder then, if I would make a good mother.  I mean, playing with little kids is fun sometimes, and it's usually ok for a couple of hours at most, but I don't think I can do it for the entire day.  It's just so hard.  Once playing with them becomes less "watching them" and more "interacting with them" (like... after the age of 7), then I really enjoy their company.  Or is that everybody's feelings?  Is it weird of me to be a girl and not go ga-ga over babies?  Does this mean that I shouldn't become a mother (someday later if I actually get married)?  Maybe I'd feel differently if it's my own kid.  Anyway, I'm glad that at least at my sister's wedding, my bridesmaid duties prevent me from having kids foisted on me.  I really enjoyed talking to my 20-yr-old cousin, Jessica.  I can't believe she's a college sophomore.  I remember when I first met her.  She was just a toddler.  And soon, I remember her whining to not go to pre-school.  I used to play Barbies with her.  And now... I almost didn't recognize her.  I mean, her face is familiar, but not having spoken to her much in the past decade, it was weird to see her acting and talking like... a college kid.  Wow.  Now I really am old.  (Speaking of which, without the presence of Jessica's sister Linda, and my own two siblings, I was the oldest kid at the dinner tonight.  Weird.)  'kay, this went on long enough.  Comments, please!

						   Ubbi-dubbi... c'mon y'guys!  Alright, so now I'll reveal what my "errand" was: a second interview at Starbucks.  To quote a young slave from Tatooine, "Yipee!"  So, I had a rather long discussion with my friend regarding yesterday's post, but I will not go into it.  Instead, I'll just make this one statement: my faith would have me praising all the glory to God, but I think on a humanist psychological level, I don't dare claim glory for myself because it's too easy to get your ego crushed that way.  Hell, I was a hotshot in highschool, but Berkeley smashed it outta me.  Perhaps the best way to describe this way of thinking is, I won't get anything because I don't deserved it and it's only by the grace of God that I get anything.  From the ego's self-preservation POV, it makes sense.  Well, this turned out to be more than one statement.  I think the interview at Starbucks went well, though it was with the shift lead instead of the store manager.  I did get a free drink, though.  A huge thing of chai latte over ice.  Mmmmm, good.  One of the questions was what I would change about Starbucks.  I didn't really have one, but I just replied, well, I really like Thai Ice Tea, so Starbucks should make a drink out of it.  Is it a good sign if the interviewer talks more about himself than me?

						   Okay, I'll give you guys until the next week to figure out the source of ubbi-dubbi.  Besides, I want to give two of my readers a chance to catch up after they get back from their honeymoon.  (Hint: c'mon and zoom!)  I'm kinda gonna get a bit gushy here:  I can't claim to know God's plan for me, my family, and the Universe, but all I can say is that He's definitely at work in my life.  I mean, if God doesn't exist, then I'm too damn lucky.  Without going into detail lest I jinx my "errand" tomorrow, I'm just going to say that somehow, God has led me to the best possible solution for my life right now.  I'm sure He didn't like that I wasn't going to church last year, but He did finally kick me in the butt to go, and now I really like my church.  And at this church, I signed up to take a Bible study on finances.  I didn't want to at first, since it cost money and an evening a week, but God worked His mojo and I was convinced to sign up right before it started.  Once there, I learned a lot of good lessons, but one lesson really impacted me this past month.  That God puts kings in power and He takes them away from power, meaning, it's all up to God whether or not you get that promotion, or in my case, that job.  As you all know, I became unemployed early June and I have been scrounging around for jobs since.  Well, I prayed to God about every application, and most of the time He said no.  I was disappointed, but the lesson from Crown kept me hopeful knowing that getting a job isn't all up to me.  I can turn in the application, attend the interviews, but it's ultimately God that determines whether or not I get the job.  So I just did my part, prayed, and just kept the faith that God knew what He was doing.  And He did!!!  My aunts and uncle from Korea leave for the airport in approximately seven hours.  It's been a great two weeks with them.  And with my "errand" tomorrow, I realize now why God had me be unemployed this summer.  After all, they needed a translater, a local guide, and a local cuisine chef.  If I was too busy working, then they wouldn't have gotten a taste of In-N-Out or tacos or homemade frappuccinos (which were somewhat of a failure).  They wouldn't have known about GNC (and the really nice guy that gave me a discount).  They wouldn't have been able to find the sunglass outlet.  Nor been able to talk to the airline about scheduling changes.  And I wouldn't have been able to stay up 'til 3 am chatting with my slightly-drunk uncle about the mindset of artists.  So... thank you God.  I didn't like that I had no job, but now I'm glad I didn't.  And now, God is still faithful.  He still remembered my prayers from before.  Now, I don't know what the outcome of my "errand" will be, but I have faith that God will put me where I need to be.

						   I remember one thing that I meant to talk about:  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen .  It was pretty good.  A fun movie.  You could tell that the director cut out an hour's worth of exposition and character development, though.  Like, they really could have put the tease about Mina Harker's mysterious abilities like in the comics.  Allan Quartermain's chauvanism clashing with that was way cool, and it's really too bad they couldn't have shown more of it.  And Skinner, the Invisible Man, is at his best when he's being a male pig.  Anyway, it's a fun romp.  There was just so much interaction that had to be cut out for time's sake, I guess.  There is one observation that I made which is somewhat of a spoiler.  So I'm going to write it in ubbi-dubbi for those of you that don't want to read it.  (Ubbi-dubbi is pretty easy to figure out.  It follows conventional syllable-insertion code.)  Ubbaftubber rubbeaddubbing thubbe cubbomubbic, thubbey ubbobvubbiubbouslubby ubbaddubbed twubbo nubbew chubbarubbactubbers.

Anyway, that was a little oberservation I made at the end of the movie that I sorta had realized at the beginning of the it.  (Y'know, I realize you could probably crack this code easy just by copying and pasting to Word, and then using Replace with a blank.)  It sucks that it's almost 5 am and I'm still not asleep....  (Bonus points to anyone that can tell me where I learned Ubbi-dubbi.)

						   The Servustat is misleading, I think.  Just cuz every time I view the blog for comments or whatnot, it counts me as a unique viewer.  I should be like  urlLink Beno  and carry around a PDA cuz I had some interesting thoughts that popped in my head today, and now that I'm all set to blog them, I forgot.  :P  As some of you know, for  urlLink Crown Bible Study  I kept track of my finances steadily since February.  Heck, I've even driven my sister crazy by suggesting to her she do the same.  But I do have to eat my own words here, cuz for the past month I haven't been keeping track.  It's sort of depressing, but since I didn't have any income coming in, and being out of school meant I had less expenses going out, I just didn't want to bother.  Nothing would fit my budget anyway, since I have no income and there's no way I can estimate my expenses since all I've been doing is boiling at home and hanging out once a week with Robert.  I've resolved that I'll start again at the beginning of August since school would be starting soon anyway.  And hopefully by then I'll have some sort of an employment situation.  Gotta go, my weh-sam-choon is calling me for scotch-and-cokes.... ;)

						   So... what have I been doing this past week?  Nuthin'.  Last weekend was such a high, that I think I crashed back to earth.  I did a bit of hanging out with a friend, I had a job interview that I'm praying like mad for, but other than that, I've just been chillin' at home.  And it's rather hard to chill in such weather.  Well, it hasn't been that bad, actually.  Still a bit muggy.  I've been playing house since my mom and our Korean relatives went on a 5-day sight-seeing trip.  I'm sort of impressed that I can throw together a meal every night.  But then, it's not that hard and I knew I could do it.  I just don't.  I do, however, have new appreciation for my mom.  I mean, I forgot to put the trash bins on the curb this week.  I just hope we don't have a lot of trash just sittin' there.  There's a lot to running a house.  Ach, no wonder I don't want to grow up.  So I had a group interview with Starbucks on Monday.  I thought I did well, but I'm not a good judge of that.  I think the manager said that they'll call for 2nd interviews next Monday.  Why does it take a whole week to determine who to call for 2nd interviews???  Whyyyyy???   Whhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyy??????  I'm so lazy.  Not only have I not check my e-mail in the past four days, but I also haven't fully unpacked from last weekend.  I don't even know what to do with my bridesmaid dress.  It's stained with sweat, make-up, and gochu-jang (red pepper paste).  I mean, I do want to keep it, even though I'll never ever wear it again, but I don't want to pay to have it cleaned.  Maybe it's just me being cheap?

						   Do y'all remember a movie called  urlLink The Wedding Banquet ?  Y'know that scene of the wedding night, which I guess is a Chinese tradition or something?  (The one involving friends and underwear.)  Well, I got roped into helping out Kaela and Beno's friends do that to them.  Eww.  Gross.  That's why I left off in the middle of my last blog entry.  Afterwards, I just hung out with relations while my uncle poured me several bourbon-cokes.  It was 3 in the morning before I took a shower and went to bed.  I scrubbed off so much make-up.  The Hotel laundry's gonna hate me.  Y'know what else is nice?  Free coffee and muffin bar in the morning.  Though they ran out of muffin quick.

						   Dagnabit!  Lost my post.  Here I go again:  I'm soooo tired.  After a year-and-a-half of planning, it all came down to one day.  Today.  And... well, to say that it went off without a hitch is... impossible.  It was a loooong day.  I look great, though.  Especially my hair.  I like up-dos.  :)  So I now officially have a new sibling.   urlLink Beno  is no longer the mouthful "my sister's fiance" but "my brother-in-law."

						   Well, I see that the online version of Blogger for Mac IE is really ghetto.  I'm writing this from the "business center" in the lobby of  urlLink the Cypress Hotel , where we're staying this weekend.  The drive up to San Jose wasn't too bad, actually.  It only took us about 6.5 hours, and that included a lot of stops for the old folks.  This hotel is really nice.  It's so new and filled with modern amenities.  I guess we're really going gourmet.  Though the mini-bar stuff is way too expensive.  The bourbon and coke items were bought at a liquor store. :)  The rehearsal went... fast.  Mainly due to half the people being late.  The flower girl/boy didn't even get a chance to practice.  Oh well, few people will care.  Besides, people in Korea have wedding cereomonies without rehearsal all the time.  The dinner afterwards was pretty good, but we ate soooo much!  Wow, this wedding has been such the focus of our family for the past year.  It'll be so weird that it will end all in one day.  ONE DAY!  Yikes.  I should also try to utilize the fitness room of this hotel.  Gotta get our money's worth!

						    Some one (ahemrobertahemthebastardahem) thinks that I wrote the last two entries while smashed.   For the record : I was not smashed.  I had a slight buzz that wore off by the time I even started writing the blog entries.  Nyah nyah.  I would have linked other similarly rambling entries if my archives weren't screwed up right now.  Maybe that someone (ahemwhoneedsagoodkickinthenutsahem) was thrown off because I wasn't whining and complaining as usual.  Well... you're in luck!  I'm back to whining!    Stupid Academy won't let me sign up for the classes that I want because they're "not at my placement level" which means that they want me to take stupid introductory computer classes where the first few lessons are on how to double-click!!!   I hope the counselor will let me skip them.  Sheesh.  Actually, I could have started registering for classes on Wednesday, but it was one of those, if you don't check you don't know dealies.  Sucks, too, cuz there was this one class that I wanted to sign up for (and actually could) but was full.   And they don't have waitlists!!!   Yet another stupidity of the school!  This will most likely be my last entry before my sister's wedding this Saturday.  I'll try to get a photo of me in my bridesmaid ensemble.  Wish me luck!  And one last thing: it is frickin' hot right now.  It's cloudy, but because of the humidity, it feels like it's 100.  Ugh.  Now I can understand the appeal of  dry heat .

						   One more thing: sam-sah-choon!!!  It's surprising how just a couple of shots of it on a full stomach could still whack you over like that.  It's also suprising how fast the buzz wears off.  Ah well, you drink it for the taste.  It's really sweet.  Like plum wine.  And only 32 proof!

						   My uncle (weh-sam-choon) and his wife (weh-soong-mo) and my aunt (ee-mo) came from Korea on Tuesday.  My uncle is a riot.  He was a ship captain way back when and he used to go back and forth from the US.  So his english ain't too bad and he loves the chance to use it.  He also loves to drink, though he can't too much cuz of his health.  Anyway, I wasn't home last night (I was hanging out with Robert and Mike, and we finished out our adventure for Mage, a fun RPG that's completely focused on story-telling and role-playing.) so I didn't get a chance to "have a nightcap."  But we did tonight, 'cept that we did it right after dinner.  We had dinner kinda late cuz we were swimming, and when there's four in a pool, it takes awhile for everyone to shower afterwards.  I went last and ended up a prune.  On a side note, the weather's been horribly hot and muggy, but this 100-degree weather has one benefit in that by the evening cool, the pool has been heated nicely.  We watched "Pirates of the Caribbean" last night.  Johnny Depp was so over-the-top that it was rather good.  Well, the story was corny, but... the movie is based on the ride!  Of course it will be corny!  It's a comedy, after all.  Or if it wasn't meant to be, well, it's one now!  They had a lot of references to the ride which made it cool.  For example, they had Ruby from the Buy-a-Bride auction, though there wasn't an auction in the movie.   And ... alas... let's face it, Legolas is hot... Orlando Bloom is not.  Sorry this is jumping all over the place, but here's one thing I learned: when having a drink poured to you from an older person (or at least one deserving of respect) you must hold your glass with both hands.  I remember being taught to receive things with both hands as a kid (though it's not so strictly upheld here) but I didn't know it also encompassed drinking ettiquette.  I'm not sure if we'll be drinking much tomorrow night since we all have to go to bed early so we can get up at 4 am the next day.  One more thing: at my sister's wedding this Saturday (I can't believe it's already here!) I will be meeting my cousin's kid for the first time.  Since I'm like 16 years older than him, he can call me "aunt" though based on the English system he's a first-cousin-once-removed.  Funny though that I've got first cousins that are younger than him.  But suppose my sister has a kid in a year.  ( Suppose ... ok?)  Then that kid and my Uncle Steve's 6-month-old would only be a year-and-a-half apart.  But they would be considered first-cousins-once-removed.  Yep, it's a complex system.  My friend brought her first-cousin-once-removed to church last Sunday.  She calls my friend "ee-mo."  They are only 8 years apart.  Eh.  It's too confusing.  Though the main thing here is that this kid will think of me as an "aunt."   Trippy.

						   Oops, I meant to post something this past week, but I just got too lazy.  The camping trip was fun last weekend.  It was 15 of us at Hungtington Lake for three days and three nights.  Well, two-and-a-half days.  And the last day, Sunday, we woke up (that is, Erica woke me up) at 5:45 am to get on the road by 6:30.  That's the earliest I've been up in... years.  Well, except for when I pulled all-nighters.  I've never swam in a lake before.  And once you get over the algae-covered rocks the layer of algae floating on top, then it's pretty cool.  I do have to admit that I couldn't help adding more algae-food to the water.  Hey, once that cold water hits you, you don't have control over your bladder!  The last night we built a huge bonfire using a bug-ridden log.  Fun.  This past week was spent in the pits of insecurities as I continued my search for a job.  I hate the phrase, "We're not hiring right now, but we're accepting applications."  If I was ever in charge of a retail store, I would say instead, "We're not hiring right now, but you can fill one of these applications out and we'll be sure to glance at it as we throw it in the garbage."  I thought I had prospects at a newly-opening EB Games, but no.  Apparently, being fully-staffed means that you should put up a sign saying "Now Hiring!"  I think I impressed the manager at Color-Me-Mine, except that they have no openings.  Sigh.  If I'm still jobless in two weeks, I'll go in there and see if they really might have something open.  (Yeah right.)  Then yesterday, I called the Starbucks and pretty much made an ass out of myself talking to the manager lady.  Well, not an ass.  I came off as desperate, but I doubt that she really even cared.  But at least I said my name (said it's spelled weird, which might trigger her memory when finally looking over the applications) and hopefully she's willing to hire the stink of desperation.  I know that God gave me all this free time to do something productive.  But so far the only thing that's happened is that my skin got darker as my hair got lighter (I got my hair done yesterday) which is giving me this weird tonal appearance.  I actually took a Maya book with me to the salon, but I chose to read their Vanity Fair instead.  It's up to God whether or not I get a job.  But I think God wants me to have a job.  I know I have to do my part in looking for it, but I get so discouraged.  Sigh.  Perhaps He is telling me to keep working on art while looking for a job.  Don't put my entire focus on the job search.  This is a long one.

						     You habitually make disgustingly ugly LiveJournal icons. No. No, don't try to deny it! We've all seen them, and they are fucking ugly as sin, and for this you have damned yourself to an eternity of suffering. It is justice! After all, you've probably blinded dozens of people.  STOP THIS NOW AND REPENT! Perhaps you will be saved.    urlLink   Why Will You Go To Hell?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    There are too many online quizzes out there and too many people posting their results on their blog.  (You know who you are!)  But... well, I thought this one was funny.  I guess I'm going to Purgatory the above reason, even though I don't know what LiveJournal is.  Thanks for your comments, everybody!  I figure I should respond to some of them in an entry instead of in the pop-up.  Cat, I am Mike's friend Erica's friend and former roommate at Cal.  Wow, such degrees of separation.  You-know-who, how the heck do you turn off windows messenger?  (They look like a windows box instead of a pop-up ad from a website.)  DrWhateley, you keep posting your comments twice!  It makes me think I'm more popular than I am.  Gettin' my hopes up and then dashin' them to the ground in a pool of congealed blood.  Um... yeah.  This past weekend was fun as well as exhausting.  Sure, I could have exercised more to be prepared, but what's the point?  Just the walk up from the campfire to my tent made me breathe hard.  Perhaps I can blame it on the elevation?  7000 feet.  That's high enough to make everything hard, right?  (BTW, I learned why it was important to stretch every muscle, including your groin muscles, if you're planning on hiking.  And also, it is really important to put on lip protection as well as sunblock.)  (I'll elaborate on my vacation weekend happenings in a later entry.)

						   Observation: A lot of people view "saving money on a product" as "earning money."  "B-b-but... it's on sale!"  Well, in the end, did you come out of it with more money than you started with?  Sigh.  I have to remind myself that it's none of my business.  They are adults.  They should be able to figure out if they can afford something or not.  Except that millions of Americans are living in debt.  Credit card debt is the worst.  Y'know how if you can find an 18% investment, it's really good?  Well, if you're not paying off your credit cards at the end of the month, the credit card company is making 18% "investment" off of you.  And  you  provided the principal to boot.  It's like you walk into Charles Schwab, sit down, and right away they tell you, we're giving you $1000, you're earning $100 a month in interest, and next month we'll add another $500 to your account, which will earn you another $50 a month in interest.  Incredulous, no?  I need a job.  This living-off-my-savings suck.  But if you look hard enough, there are cheap ways of having fun.  Especially if you've got a friend with lots of DVDs.  I've watched the first two seasons of  Farscape .  The show is really good.  (There's a reason why I put the "Save Farscape" link on the left side, beyond my friend Robert yelling at me to do so.)  What's hilarious is what they do with standard sci-fi plots.  Like the standard sci-fi body-switching episode.  But when Crichton's (a man) mind goes into the body of Aeryn (a woman), in one moment, he realizes something, looks down, opens his shirt, and starts feeling himself up and watching them shake.  Now... most guys, when placed in the body of a woman, would do this.  But in other sci-fi shows, they're more concerned with making things right and acting all serious.   That  is what makes Farscape unique.  (Like how  Firefly  was unique.  Sigh.  Stupid network execs.)

						   I gotta say, Kate Mulgrew looks a lot like Katharyn Hepburn.  I only mention that because Voyager's on right now (yep, in LA they run them at 3 am weeknights) and because Katharyn Hepburn died days ago.  You know what's worse than crack?  You know what's worse than...  Magic: the Gathering ?    Rollercoaster Tycoon   It's toooo addicting.  More fun than The Sims.  It's challenging designing rollercoasters.  You have to know what will help you accelerate, what will keep the G-forces down, and what will keep your car from flying off the track.  That's a bit of physics and mechanical engineering.  So far, my efforts have been... marginal.  People are puking left and right.  Anyway, if I plan on getting any sleep this week, I will have to take a break from Rollercoaster Tycoon.  It's too bad I can't use the expansion pack.  Something about it not being compatible with Windows XP.  More job prospects.  Wish me luck!  (Pray for me, if you will.)

						   Well, after a last-dtich effort, alas I could not find someone to cover my shift tomorrow morning.  That is why I am posting in my blog right now rather than holing up in a hotel room.  Well, it's allowed me to procrastinate some more for packing.  Meanwhile, I'm feeling a bit feverish and I need to go to sleep... NOW.  After all, I've got a 7 am shift.  But... I can't.  Sleep, that is.  I forgot to write down my shifts for next week, but I can do that tomorrow.  All I can say is that I've got another 4:45 am shift next Tuesday.  I think the hardest part about that shift is that I get home from school around 11 pm the night before.  Thanks for all y'all comments!  I won't be able to post until Monday, but please feel free to post as many comments as you wish!

						   Ach, no comments!  I am not loved!!!  Anyway, so I have now been to all four of my classes.  I kinda feel guilty, like I should take more, but right now I'm at 11 units, ideally I want 12 but there aren't any good 1-unit classes, and besides, one 2-unit class seems like a 3-unit one.  I was late to school today partly due to me leaving late, but also there was a lot of traffic on the way in.  Damn rubberneckers.  So even though I left roughly the same time as Monday, I got here about 20 mins later.  I repeat, damn rubberneckers.  Then it threw me to see a friend of mine sitting in the front row, because I had just seen him on Monday and he didn't mention that he was taking this class.  So I got confused and thought I was in the wrong room.  So I spent another 5 mins verifying that yes, that is the room.  So not only am I late, but I look stupid.  Greeeeeaaaaaaat.  Alrighty, so my class schedule is as follows:  M 1-4pm:  Web Animation (w/ Flash) -- Though the first third of the class is stuff I've done before, I've got hopes that I'll be able to learn something.  M 6:30-9:30pm:  Storytelling -- Like I've said, guest speakers=nice, too much homework=not nice  W 12:30-4:30pm: Storyboard 1 -- (This is the 2-unit class!  Every other one is 3!)  From the looks of it, we'll be watching a lot of movies and discussing them, and we'll be storyboarding.  Kinda like "Directing 101"  W 6:30-9:30pm: Beginning Digital Editing -- Due to a misprint in the catalogue, I thought this class was going to be Motion Graphics, i.e. AfterEffects.  However, it'll be mostly Premiere, some AfterEffects, and a little bit of FinalCut Pro.  For those of you that know, I took a year of digital video, which was an intense learn-as-you-go experience with Premiere.  So... I'm kinda iffy about what I'll learn in the first month.  But then, it has been two years, and it can't hurt to learn actually how to use it rather than, "I want to do ________ and I don't know how!"  "Well, figure it out."  So that's it.  (I think part of the reason why I have a hard time communicating with that friend -- who's now in two of my classes! -- is that he's from Korea and he's only been here for a little over a year.  He's taking his last ESL class this winter, so he told me to talk to him only in English so he can practice.  Y'see, he's got a Korean roommate who's only been here 5 months so therefore his English sucks and he only has Korean friends, and he's got a Korean boss with a Korean business that has only Korean clients.  So it's kinda odd having to speak slowly so he can understand me, and repeating myself repeatedly, but I have to try hard to understand his broken English -- cuz it don't matter how much ESL one takes, if you've got an accent, you've got an accent.  Meanwhile, his roommate et al just smile and don't say a word around me cuz they're embarrassed by their English and doesn't think that I understand Korean.)  Y'know, even though SMC got reamed by the budget cuts, I'm still surprised by the number of students here.  I guess the quality of the teachers do make a difference.  My editing teacher works at Sony Imageworks, and my storytelling teacher was dropping names like missiles on Iraq.  It's convinced me that I did make the right decision in making the loooong trek here twice a week.  After all, I could've signed up for classes at  urlLink Mt. SAC .  They've got a computer animation program.  Heck, they all do.  (And what would be funny?  I'd be in the same school as one of my Starbucks leads.)  But I really doubt that any of the teachers over there have had the professional experiences that this school's teachers have or are having.  Another long blog.  Please comment!

						   This morning's opening shift wasn't as bad as I thought.  For the first 45 mins, all we did was get the store ready.  And oddly enough, there was a customer waiting for the store to open at 5:30.  The crowd was light, and things were pretty easy.  And I had absolutely no parking problems.  Around 7 am the morning rush came in spurts, but all-in-all, it wasn't bad at all.  By the time I left around 9 (I made myself a Venti Iced Mocha -- three shots of espresso!) the real morning rush was pretty heavy.  Yeah, it was disturbing to start work when it's dark.  When I left, 90% of the other stores in the shopping center weren't even open.  But... well, it was kinda nice.  Sure, I've been up for almost six hours now, and I'm tired, but it's kinda cool to have accomplished something before most people have even woken up.  As for school, I think it'll be good this semester.  I crashed a Flash class, and I'm first on the waiting list, so I'll probably get in.  SMC is stupid in that they don't have automatic waitlists, at least not for Academy classes.  (Ah, I miss the days of Berkeley.)  So it started out as 9 people trying to take 3 seats, and then a few people moved to laptops and a few people wanting to add didn't stick around at the end, so it ended up 3 people trying for 2 seats.  And I was the odd one out.  But there was one guy who didn't come and the teacher couldn't get ahold of, so if he doesn't show up next class, then I get his seat.  If anything, I figure if I stick around enough, then I'll eventually get a seat.  After all, I don't have a unit quota to fill.  (Speaking of which, the F-1 visa students now have to maintain 12 units for the semester.  It's caused a bit of desperation with the foreign students, and there are surprisingly a large number of foreign students at SMC.)  The second class is "Storytelling."  One of the books we have to read is  Understanding Comics  by Scott McCloud, so Christine, thank Alex for me for giving me that book.  (I think it was a Christmas present?)  Part of our homework this week is to watch "Enterprise."  Someone yelled out, "Could we watch a better show?"  Haha.  Yeah... that show does need a lot of work.  But I've been rather loyal to the Star Trek franchise since I got into TNG during high school.  Heck, I even went to see  Nemesis  in the theaters.  Anyway, the exciting part of the class is the guest speakers.  And at our next class, the speaker will be... Alison Arngrim!  (She played Nellie Olsen on "Little House on the Prairie.")  Anyway, before I end this entry, for those you that don't know, "snoogins" means "just kidding," and "snooge" means something like "that's cool" both are references from  Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back .  And DrWhateley would like the rest of you, my gentle readers, to respond to his whacked out comments.  So comment away, please!

						   It was kinda weak of me, but on Saturday, after only a four-hour shift, I came home beat.  But I learned to make Tazoberry Frappuccino, and Tazoberry Creme Frappuccino (which is really really good!), Mocha Frappuccino, Caramel Frappuccino, and Mocha Malt Frappuccino.  I made a Cafe Americano and a Latte, but I don't remember how.  Oh, for those of you that want to know (namely only Beno), my Starbucks uses actual ground espresso.  They have a policy to use espresso within 10 seconds of brewing.  So every brew makes two shots, and for each brew, they use new espresso.  It's kinda cool.  You dump the old, then put two pushes of espresso into the jet, use this thing to pat it down, stick it back on the brewer, and then hit the button to brew two shots.  It's been tough getting someone to cover my Saturday shift.  Apparently, it's a big holiday weekend or something. :)  Still, if I can't get anyone to cover it, then I'll have to go to the Retreat late, miss two sessions with the guest speaker, and arrive in the middle of the San Diego Zoo trip.  Which means that I'll have to call and ask to see which animals they're next to and try to catch up.  So rather than do all that, I would rather go Friday night.  Today after church, I stayed after a bit to help make care packages for retreat.  But first we went to Starbucks to get coffee.  And I was able to use my 30% discount!  So cool.  So we got 5 drinks and it came out to only $12!  Sweet.

						   Well, I sorta have next weekend taken care of.  I just have to have someone take over my Saturday morning shift.  Either that, or I will end up going to the retreat late.  Next Tuesday, they've got me scheduled for the opening shift.  It is  insane .  From 4:45  AM  'til 8:45!  I'm usually not even awake at 8:45 am!  I'm half-tempted to stay up all night for it, except that all-nighters ruin even my sleep pattern.  School starts in three days!  Oh, I promised to post my schedule every week on my blog.  So, here goes:   Tomorrow : 2-6 pm work  Sunday : church 'til 1:30ish   Monday : school all day (though it might end early)  Tuesday : 4:45-8:45 am work  Wednesday : school all day  Thursday : FREE  Friday : 10:30-2 pm work, then head off to retreat around 6pm  Saturday : RETREAT (unless I can't get someone to cover my shift, then it's 7:00-11:15 am work)  Sunday : RETREAT   Monday : (Labor Day) RETREAT

						   I need to go to sleep considering that I've got work in 10 hours.  (It still feels odd considering I've been a "lady of leisure" for so long.)  But I screwed up with my schedule request (I thought Labor Day Weekend was Sept 6-8, not Aug 30-Sept 1) and I hope that won't cause problems.  Argh.  Today's training class was fun.  The funnest part was the coffee-tasting.  It's a lot like wine-tasting.  We used a french press to brew four different kinds of coffee and then poured them in little cups.  You take each cup, smell deeply to describe the aroma ("Umm... it smells like coffee."), then slurp it to figure out what part of the tongue tastes it ("Umm... in the center?"), and then you drink it too describe the taste ("Umm... it tastes like coffee.").  But I do have to say, there is a difference.  At least between the Starbucks stuff and the stuff out of the can.  (I think it was Folgers.)  The Starbucks stuff, at least the "bold" coffee, isn't as acidic (i.e. sour) so it's something you could even drink black.  Anyway, to answer your question, Beno, as a barista, I would mostly brew.  I think.  I haven't been trained to make espresso stuff yet.  They actually have a 9-shift new-hire training schedule.  I know that the espresso-based cold drink bases are made from a mix, though before they actually brewed the espresso for each batch.  It's more complex than I thought, being a barista.  Mainly due to all the different drinks and coffees there are.  But it beats telemarketing. :)  And the company does seem to care about their employees.  Oops, I mean  partners .  In 90 days, I'd qualify for stock options, where I can buy SBUX shares for a 15% discount.  Nice.  But it might not be 'til December that I qualify for medical.  I think I'm finally getting over the jitters.  Caffeine on an empty stomach isn't a good thing. :)

						    urlLink More wedding photos finally up!   Thanks for all your congrats.  I start working next Tuesday, and if you guys come by while I'm on shift and there's no one else there, I'll totally hook y'all up!  School starts soon, too.  This week is my last week of laziness.  I gotta stop staying up this late, too.  This weekend was a mixture of good and bad.  Sometimes my parents (mainly my mom) can drive me so nuts!  I won't go much into detail, but I will say that when East meets West, things ain't pretty.  Comments please on how hot I look in those wedding photos!

						   Happy Birthday to Kaela!  And in case I don't get a chance to say so next week, Early Happy Birthday Beno!  Anyway, I promised pictures, and I will post them... soon.  I just end up using my Dad's computer too often, and it's a hassle going back and forth between the two.  On another note, the city of Chino is in an outrage over  The OC .  It was on the local news after this week's show.  The news crew was actually at the Chino Spectrum, right in front of the Starbucks (more on that next).  Ppl complained that the show wasn't accurately portraying Chino, that there are a lot of nice houses and good schools here.  And it's true.  I haven't seen as much graffitti here as some parts of Placentia, too.  The mayor has offered to take the producers on a tour of Chino, but so far, they haven't accepted.  I think it would have been a little more realistic had the kid been from South LA (no longer South Central since the city council voted to change it... something about negative connotation), cuz Chino isn't so much "wrong side of the tracks" as it's more "used to be one giant farm."     Now, for my big news :  OHMYOHMYOHMYOHMYOHMYOHMYOHMYOHMYOHMY  So finally, two weeks after my second interview at Starbucks, I get up the balls to call Starbucks, thinking if they're going to reject me, then I at least want to know the reason why.  Well, the manager picks up, I tell her who I am, she says that she was just about to start making the call-backs.  Then she says, oh, I think you're over-qualified to be just a barista.  Well, I reply that I just needed a job for the next coupla years while I go to school.  And then she says, oh, so it's not a career thing for you.  Oh, but what about the long drive?  And I'm thinking, that Starbucks is a 5-min drive away.  I could even walk there.  But then she elaborates, you drive so far for school.  Ohhh.  So I reply, oh, I only go to school about two to three days a week, and this fall (if i successfully crash that one class) I'll only be going to school Mondays and Wednesdays.  Well, she replies, that's different.  And then she says, ok, I'm going to hire you on, I'll call you back to schedule a first impression.  Daaaaang.  Some of you might notice that this entry is posted rather early in the day.  (I'm sorta not used to waking up before noon... or 1 pm... or even 2 pm....)  Well, she called me back this morning and gave me my  schedule  for next week.  Holy moly!   I'm officially employed now !!!  Afterwards, I spent the next ten minutes scared out of my wits.  That's the thing about unemployment.  I've been unemployed for so long (and before that, I barely worked 2-5 hours per week), that I've grown to love my captors.  Yeah, it sucked having no money and constantly fighting with my mom about my laziness, but in exchange, I had  TIME .  Lots of it.  I developed a bad habit of watching late night TV.  I just checked out some books from the library.  Final Fantasy Tactics.  I've even been keeping up with the storyline of  Days of Our Lives .  (Speaking of which,  Sami and Lucas ???  That's too whack.)  But, as the Bible says (I think), he who does not work, does not eat.  And since I haven't been doing much housework, I figure it'd be easier for me to contribute financially.  And if anything, now I can start saving up for a Vegas trip, and perhaps even a Korea trip.

						   I will be posting more wedding pictures soon, so click on the link on the entry below sometime in the next few days.  One word, though: it's MY vanity website, so I'm putting up pictures mostly of me.  Yeah, yeah.  Wanna see less of me and more of them?  Tough.  Try  urlLink Beno 's website.  They should be under journal.  (Speaking of which, Beno, update your website!  At least change the index page!  It's really out of date!  If you want, I can even make a flash splash page for you.)  Anyway, thanks to y'all for your comments.  I haven't called Starbucks yet, but I'll do so soon.  Why do I really want to work there when they are frickin' busy morning 'til night?  Cuz they offer benefits even to part-timers.  Now, I don't care about the stock options, but it would be nice to have medical insurance.  I haven't had a check-up in three years.  What's my latest time-waster?   Final Fantasy Tactics.   I named my main guy CletusTheYokel (slack-jawed wouldn't fit), I think cuz I was inspired by  The OC .  For those of you that did figure out where Ubbi-Dubbi came from... how'd you figure it out?  Did my clues help?  One more thing:  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  is an underrated movie.  Well, it's more enjoyable if you've read the literature that these characters have come from.  And the comic books.  Anyway, Tom Sawyer's age is late-20's, right?  Perhaps even mid- or early-20's.  Well, in  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer , he's about 12 or 13, and slavery was still legal, which meant that it was sometime in the 1850's.  Even if it was in the early 1860's, by the time the movie rolls around, it's almost 40 years later (1899).  So Tom Sawyer should be about 50.  But... well, you gotta have a handsome American hunk.  BTW, I don't know if you, my gentle readers, know that Mark Twain wrote a sequel called  Tom Sawyer, Detective  and that's where they got the idea to make him a Secret Service Agent.  Yeah, I know, one of you told me that.  Now shut up.  I really wish they had played up the Tom's-crush-on-Mina thing more.

						   Okay, it's been awhile, so I've got a lot to say:  First note, in the new show  The OC , the "poor" kid from the other side of the tracks is from Chino!  Hahahaha!  If I didn't bag on this town as much as I do, I'd be offended.  After all, there aren't  that  many houses with mattresses and tires and a chain link fence in the front yard.  Second, I haven't heard from Starbucks yet, it's been more than a week... so what does that mean?  Third, Ah-nold is running for governor.  I am tempted to vote for him just so I could say that The Terminator is my governor.  And he probably can't screw up California more than it's already been screwed.  Fourth, the source of Ubbi-Dubbi is... the show  Zoom  on PBS!  Yeah, I'm pathetic, but I like to catch it every now and then.  It's basically a show where kids send in jokes, stories, etc, and there is a cast of kids who tell jokes, act out stories (usually in Ubbi-Dubbi), play games that other kids have invented, and do science experiments.  Fifth, I stole some pics off my  urlLink brother-in-law 's website (still sounds weird!) and you can see them on his journal or else I put them all in one  urlLink place  on my website.

						   Crap, I had written a lengthy post, and then it got lost!  Dagnabit!  Alright, I'm getting tired, but to recount: Thanks for your comments, sorry you can't delete a double-post, all you have to do is click "comment" once and have faith that it is saving.   urlLink Hint  for the origins of Ubbi-dubbi.  Anyway, briefly, I went kayaking with church folks today.   urlLink Malibu Kayaks .  It was fun, but three hours of oaring is a tough workout.  And the water that splashed onto me is seawater, so it dried to a nice, thin layer of salt.  My shoulders are killing me, but I think what's worse is that I got sunburned... again.  I swear, I put on so much sunblock.  SPF 30!  And yet, my legs have developed a reddish tinge.  Due to this activity, I wasn't able to go to the airport with my parents to meet up with my sister and her husband (!) before they flew back to San Jose.  I get torn like that.  There have been other times where I was forced to choose between hanging out with family or friends.  (Sometimes that choice was taken away from me.)  I guess it's cool that I actually do like hanging out with my family, considering that many other 24-year-olds avoid it like the plague.  I guess I just want the best of both worlds.  Especially since my weekdays tend to be filled with boredom and/or loneliness.  Well, I'm not really lonely.  There are many times I prefer solitude to company.  But I don't think I can ever live alone.  It's comforting to know that my parents are in the other room.  But it sucks to want company and not have it, and also to have too much company.  Such are the little dilemmas of life.  Hardly worth mentioning.  'Cept in my blog!  No word from Starbucks yet.  They said that my availabilities is one of the biggest hiring factors.  Well, I'm free practically every single day, and it was true when I applied four weeks ago, and it'll be true for about three more weeks.  But then school will start!  Aye chihuahua.  Who knew that it would take a month to hire for a coffeeshop?

						   Congrats, Count Whateley.  You will be known as the evil-LPCA-guy from now on, though the managers will more likely call you Golden Boy.  And yes, at Starbucks, we are allowed to have free syrup in our drinks.  Today I got a cup of coffee (Guatemalan/Antiguan, which is supposed to be smooth, rich, and complex, it tasted like... coffee) and added a pump of vanilla.  Well, that and my breakfast consists of a Tazoberry Creme Frappuccino.  I coulda had a lo-cal version by not adding the creme, but c'mon, no creme?  That's what makes it tasty.  I'm thinking of experimenting with a half coffee/ half creme concoction.  Or maybe creme base with a shot of espresso.  The guest speaker last night was a literary agent.  Well, more like he represented scriptwriters and producers.  He looked a bit like David Boreanaz.  It was really interesting the stuff he had to say.  The main point?  The way to work in the entertainment industry -- any position -- is to schmooze.  And 90% of an agent's job is to schmooze.  Anyway, he said some interesting things about how to work as a writer (for TV and film) so if any of you want to know, just ask.  What was hilarious was that even though the coordinator said no scripts, people still pitched him ideas.  Well... not per se pitch, but more like, hey, I've got an idea what do you think, and hey, can I talk to you sometime about some of my projects.  One rant that's going to make me sound like a bee-otch:  There's a handicapped girl in my class who I think has cerebral palsy.  She talks reeeeeeeeally slow.  But here's what makes it worse, she takes forever to get to her point.  She doesn't just ask the question, she starts out with, "I may be being redundant..." or "Sorry to bother you..." or "I have a question that I would like you to answer..." or the worse "I'm sorry to bother you and I may be being redundant but I have a question that I would really like you to answer...."  Now picture saying that at a second per word.  And add a pause before and after every phrase.  And here's the thing, because she's disabled, we can't say anything about it!  Whenever she pauses to think up the word she means (and this happens a lot) the teacher or other students tend to jump in with assumptions.  Like last night, she asked, "I'm sorry I may be being redundant (pause) but I have a question I would like you to answer (pause).  I have a brother (pause) who's a writer and he written a script (pause) and what was that movie (pause) with the two boys (pause) I can't remember (pause) (someone jumps in "Good Will Hunting") (the speaker "Oh, Project Greenlight") and so on" and basically, the question she asked was, "What should he do to break in since he's gotten a well-received script?"  And I'm probably being insensitive, but it just bugs me when she asks a question because I know it will take forever for her to spit it out.  She reminds me of a guy that I knew in college (Erica will know who I'm talking about) that had slight physical disabilities, but basically, he just could not shut up, and it took forever to finish a conversation with him because when you think it will end, he'll jump in with more stuff.  Anyway, am I right to be annoyed or am I just an insensitive bitch?

						   I had a long shift today, but instead of actually eating a meal during my meal break, I just had a drink.  Well, it was a Chai Creme Frappuccino that I accidentally made again for a customer.  So my day's nourishment, until dinner time at 8 pm, was a tall Vanilla Creme (vanilla syrup and steamed milk), a grande Chai Creme Frappuccino, and a venti Mint Brownie & Creme Frappuccino (this is a special recipe that someone else showed me, which is pretty good, consisting of creme base, mint syrup, and brownie chips blended together).  I haven't figured out the nutritional content of those drinks, but I'm pretty sure they were bad.  But on the plus side, I'm getting plenty of calcium.  And lactose-intolerance?  Psssht!  Well, actually, I overdid it a bit and ended up with a bit of delayed-reaction runs.  (Oh don't you groan at me, missy!)  On a more serious note, the work environment at Starbucks is... a conundrum.  I mean, so far, of all my jobs since Cafe (at Berkeley), this place has had the best work environment.  I think mainly because the people around are either near my age or younger (mostly younger), and there's a lot of personal interaction.  When I was working at Kaplan, I was by myself mostly, and while I had great rapport with the students (at least in the second class), it was somewhat lonely being at the top.  At the hak-won (the learning academy), it was even worse because they called me Miss Kang, instead of Jeanna.  That and I had absolutely no support from the director.  Anyway, I'm getting along okay with the other people of Starbucks.  It's easier with the newer people, though.  Mainly because the older people there are part of a cliche.  And when I say older, I mean, those that have been there for awhile, even though the store's only a year old.  Actually, the ages of these people are younger than mine.  The second-in-command is only 20 years old.  They go drinking together after work.  Anyway I think they see me as either too old (i.e. tired), too square, or too shy.  I don't want to appear shy, but I can be quiet.  Anyway, it's not like I want to go drinking with them (I am too tired, and I can't afford the drinks, and I don't like beer) but it would be nice to have that same camaderie.  Well....  Anyway, gotta sleep, I've got an early shift tomorrow followed by Korean BBQ outreach at church.

						   Printed on the side of a grande hot cup:    What Does it Take to be a Starbucks Barista?  Baristas are trained thoroughly at Starbucks.  To earn this important title, every barista-in-training must first attend Starbucks Coffee School where the art of coffee preparation is mastered.   Umm... that's  sorta  true.  In the end, we're still grunts.  But since technically I do have skills that the common populace does not have, I guess I am a master of coffee preparation.  I didn't learn it at "Coffee School" though, unless you call messing up dozens of drinks "Coffee School."  :P

						   Thanks for all the bread tips!  I didn't Subway it today, though.  I grabbed a dollar chicken sandwich from MuckYuck's (as Beno would say) but I ended up eating it early cuz I forgot to grab a banana for my breakfast and I was starving.  I think I'll be vending machine-ing it today.  Mmmm.  Packaged rice pudding.  (Assuming it's still there this evening.)  Anybody watch the Emmys?  Since I had to work, I recorded it and watched it later.  But since radio and TV news spoiled the results for me, I ended up fast forwarding through most awards.  Well, it ain't the Oscars.  The Emmys will never win... an Emmy for the show they put on.  No songs (except for Martin Short's thing), Wanda was sad, and Conan O'Brien shoulda been given more screen time.  And the kiss... well, it was funny the first five seconds.  Then it just got gross.  Oh, speaking of work, I know I keep on forgetting to post my schedule.  Since I'm at school right now, I don't have the exact times, but here's how I remember it:  Tuesday:  opening shift Wednesday:  school Thursday: closing shift Friday: I think a mid-morning to late afternoon shift Saturday: opening, and then church outreach event in the afternoon Sunday: church and then free  My early New Year's Resolution (or perhaps a New School Year Resolution): Get enough sleep

						   Work was really busy tonight.  I joked that it was because they didn't have live music there outside to scare away the customers.  We have three new people at the store.  I'm no longer the newbie.  It was funny cuz in the first half of my shift, there were three other people there, the lead, the girl who was hired a week before me, and the new guy.  Hy-larious.  Between the three of us (not including the lead, obviously) we had less than three months experience total.  It's kinda funny seeing the new guy screw up with stuff I was screwing up with.  But everybody did their fair share of screwing up.  The main thing was that we were just packed until about 11 pm.  A line out the wazoo, a crowd of people waiting for drinks, and tons of mess-ups.  Sooo tired.  I woke up this morning (technically yesterday morning) at 7 am to go hiking with my family.  My parents have been going pretty regularly during the weekends since they got the pass in July.  Basically this one place in Azusa.  It wasn't a long hike.  About three or four miles roundtrip.  And being nestled in the mountains, we were mostly shaded from the morning sun.  There were more strenuous paths, but I think we're saving them for the "younger folks" come Thanksgiving or Christmas, depending on when los Keno plan on visiting.  Which means that I will definitely be lagging behind since I won't have a coupla fifty-somethings to keep company.  On a different note, thanks for all y'all's comments!  And thanks also for not sinking into despair with me.  I mean, yeah, we're losing jobs to foreign countries (and yes, it will happen w/ 3d, as soon as the ppl over there are trained enough), and studios and game companies (more the latter than former) are sprouting up and dying off faster than you can shish-kabob.  But... I'm not being optimistic.  The market's still there.  And if enough people band together and fight collectively, we might even be ok.  And finally, last week I did the subway foot-long for two days thing.  Nice on my wallet, tasty on Monday, but soggy bread on Wednesday.  Any ideas on how to keep the bread from soggy-ing up in two days?  I was thinking of just putting it in a container instead of keeping it in its wrapper, but I'm not sure if that'll work.  The bad thing about subway sandwiching it?  It takes time to take the shuttle to the main campus (the Subway's out front) and then take it back to the Academy.  It's time taken away from precious high-speed internet!

						   Okay, so basically, here's what happened w/ parking.  There are meters around the school (and since I come early enough, I will always get a spot), which costs $.35 an hour, which means that I would be spending around $2 a day for parking.  So that's $4 a week, and with a 16-week semester, that came out to $64 for the semester, which is cheaper than the $75 semester parking pass.  Anyway, then I discovered a little gem -- a tiny strip of curb where there are no meters.  Yep, free parking.  Anyway, other people must have discovered them too, cuz now it's starting to fill up early.  So, on Monday, I came, parked at a meter, and only put in enough money for until class ends, intending to come back to see if any free parking space had freed up before putting more money in the meter.  Well, I had forgotten that I had signed up for a counseling session, and that took an extra 30 mins, and by the time I came back, I had a ticket under my wipers.  *Sigh.  So that is why my quest for a free spot, when I coulda just put another quarter in for another 42 mins, landed me a $35 ticket.  (On a brighter note, I got a free spot today.)  Anyway, I would have to get a free spot 10 more times to make it still cheaper than the parking pass.  *Sigh.  Oh, and yet another rant: my counseling session was bunk.  Pretty much.  The main thing I wanted to get cleared up was that I didn't want to take the "Intro to Graphic Computing" class.  (See  urlLink this  entry for my description of it.)  Basically, it starts out w/ the basics of the computer, and then basics of the web, and then the basics of Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash.  So, I know already about 90% of the class material already.  (The other 10% would be Illustrator.)  I mean, I'm currently taking a Flash class (and it's pretty easy right now since they're going over stuff I already know), I've taken a Photoshop class and gotten an A, but it's not "proof" that I can use a computer, so I still need to take that stinkin' class in order to get into the other classes that I want.  (I could crash them, but crashing is too damn hard if I had to do that for all of my classes.)  The counselor said that he was a student, he understands, that he'll bring it up at the next meeting, but I doubt that will help me.  Even if anything happens, I wouldn't be able to benefit from it.  I think I'll just have to suck it up and sit through that stupid class.  That stupid impacted class that everybody and their mother want to take cuz they also need it to get into the classes they want.  Okay, this entry is getting long, but one good thing I want to rave about: on Monday we had a surprise guest speaker,  urlLink Tom Sito , best known, perhaps, as the animation director for  Osmosis Jones .  He was great!  He answered a lot of questions, and raised a lot of issues regarding animators today, and he was just a funny guy.  It made me really want to be an animator, yet also not.  It's a tough time for animation nowadays, despite all the stuff coming out nowadays.  The main thing?  All the jobs are going oversees to India and South Korea and Japan.  It's tough enough having a glut of animators in Southern California, but if there are less and less jobs... well, it's gonna be a tough market.  (Hey, it's still not too late to become a nurse!  Or a lawyer!  OMG.  Shoot me now.)

						   It started with intense pain in my left ear on Wednesday night, it spread to my throat on Thursday, and by Sunday, my nose got stuffy.  Apparently, for some people, they develop colds in this manner.  I usually don't have to deal with the earrache and just go from sore throat to head cold, which might progress to chest cold.  The thing about the earache is that it caused my inner outer ear to swell up, so now it's still swollen, and if I massage it, then it hurts like hell and fluids start coming out of it.  But I did cover a shift for a co-worker, and I definitely needed the hours.  This past week, I was sent home an hour early  two  times cuz of lack of business.  Tonight, the other girl on was sent home early.  So even though I was feeling stuffy (which, surpringly, wasn't too bad during work, and only got worse towards the very end).  In fact, despite my sickness, I was on fire, crankin' out drinks one after the other!  I finally picked up my tips today.  Ooh... nice.  It's quite a bit of money, actually, but then it encompasses several weeks, so I'm not quite sure how much extra per hour.  I have to make sure I don't go spend-crazy.  After all, I still need to recover financially from the wedding expenses (at my end), car expenses, and I want to save up for LASIK, and perhaps even a fun trip in the winter.  Oh, and there's also school expenses, too.  But being a US citizen and a California resident makes it not as bad.  There are a lot of F-1 Visa students there, and they are going through hell.  For one thing, they  have  to maintain at least 12 units, which doesn't seem so bad except that a lot of them have to work to pay for their keep, so it leaves little time for study and socialization.  Tough noogies for them.  Homework awaits.  Procrastination sucks.

						   Business was slow tonight, so we closed the store early.  It was coming home that I realized probably why.  Essay: What I Was Doing When the Buildings Fell  By the time I awoke to start the day, it was already 10 am, 1 pm on the East Coast.  When I started the day, the whole country had been in turmoil for hours.  I never turned on the TV in the mornings since I'm usually running late.  Erica had called that morning, left a message asking if we were alright.  I was clueless.  I mean, what could be wrong?  I went to Korean class at 11.  Half the class was absent.  The teacher conducted the class as usual, and I didn't see anything odd, other than that a lot of people seemed to have played hooky.  After class, I went to work (at the computer center).  I checked my e-mail, and someone asked if the University was staying open despite the jets in New York.  The reply was that the University's official position was that they were staying open.  All I could think was, what happened?  I began checking the news on the internet.  I read about the planes crashing into the World Trade Center.  It took me a few more stories to find out that it might have been a terrorist attack.  By then, the latest news was that the fourth plane had gone down in Pennsylvannia.  But it was information overload, and I had no idea what was going on.  The only other class I had that day was Art.  Funny enough, the Department cancelled all classes that day.  Or perhaps it's only the Korean work mentality that kept that language class open.  I talked a little with the class aide and another student, but I didn't fully grasp what was happening.  Then I went to work.  I chatted a bit with the supervisors, but I still didn't know what had happened.  I had scheduled a meeting for my project team that afternoon at 5 pm.  No one showed, except for one person.  I wasn't surprised.  If I had fully understood what had happened, I probably would have cancelled that meeting.  Finally, I went home and turned on the news.  CNN, Fox News, CBS News... every channel.  Someone reported that the FDNY had lost three hundred of their firefighters.  I was clueless and wondered why and how.  Y'see,  I didn't know that the buildings had collapsed .  I just kept asking myself as the news broadcasts kept repeating the same footage over and over was, why weren't they showing some live footage of the towers now?  It wasn't until the next day that I realized the full extent of what had happened.  OMG, how clueless am I?  Suffice it to say, I joined the rest of the mourning community in the next few days.

						   Sooo tired.  Too much running around today.  Basically, I had to take the shuttle to the main campus so I could late-add a class, and then grab something to eat before rushing to the shuttle stop so I could take the last shuttle back to the Academy campus.  In an effort to eat more healthily, I got a 6" chicken pizzioli sandwich from Subway.  It was very delicious, but that dinky sandwich cost $3.99 (plus tax)!!!  And that didn't include the dollar I spent on the soda!  (I know, soda != healthy, but I was on a quest to get some vanilla coke.)  (BTW, != means "does not equal", it's a programming thing)  So now I'm at a loss.  Spend more money and eat healthy, or spend less money and eat garbage?  I was even debating getting the foot-long so I could save the other half for later, but while that may work on  Monday to Wednesday, it doesn't work for Wednesday to Monday.  The veggie sandwich was cheapest, but... I'm not too crazy about vegetable sandwiches.  Though I do hafta say that Subway is crafty.  They print the fat and cholesterol content of their subs as well as a Big Mac and a Whopper on their napkins, and yes, they do have a lot of each.  So... anybody have any ideas?  (BTW, it would have cost me about the same to get a burrito and nachos at the food truck.  But... food trucks are nasty, ain't they?)

						   So I got that class I was crashing.  But now it means that I've actually gotta do the homework.  I don't have a lot of techno stuff (mainly due to my lack of finances) but I would really like a Wacom tablet for this class.  (Flash animation)  The thing is, I don't really  need  it in order to be a success in this class (I think), but it would make things so much easier.  I've resisted the temptations for awhile now (hence why it took me so long to get a cell phone, and also why i don't have a palm or an mp3 player, etc) mainly cuz I can't afford 'em, but this thing is sorta... necessary in my field.  But I'm not a professional yet, so I feel guilty about getting one, esp since by the time I do become a pro, there will most likely be a better one.  Or am I just being cheap?  I could get a decent one for about $65 on Ebay....  Okay, I'm really just rambling, aren't I?  But it would be nice to get your opinions on all this.  BTW, that weight gain's only been about 4 lbs (so far).  But I think it's a combination of frappuccinos, less exercise (due to school), and more fast food (cheap lunches during school).  But this current weight is what I weighed all last year.  It's only been this summer that I've weighed less (by 4 lbs).  So... maybe this will be a cyclical thing?  And why the heck am I discussing my weight on my blog???

						   Thanks for all your comments!!!  And thanks for all your enlightenment, too.  As soon as my uncle mentioned "lawyer," the Korean part of me did consider it for a second.  But the truth of the job rather than what's shown on TV (and I wouldn't even want to do what's shown on TV) has overridden my deep-seated desire, at some primal level, to seek glowing praise from my family.  So I will trudge on, seeking something (I'm not quite sure of) that seems to involve art and computers.  I'm kinda lame, but your comments do cheer me up. :)  And it is funny how the BlogSpot ads reflect my content.  Maybe if I start talking about cats and donkeys I'll get some x-rated ads.  ;)  Oop, gotta go, break is over.  One thing I gotta say before I go: all those Starbucks drinks (cuz I get 'em for free during shifts, so the cheapo in me gets one every single shift) is making me gain weight!

						   Current musical taste: Hubbilubbarubby Dubbuff  (stop laughing!)  Schedule for next week: Mon: school (1-4, 6:30-9:35) Tue: work 7:15 to 11:45 pm Wed: school (12:30-4:30, 6:30-9:35)  Thu: work 7:45 to 11:45 pm Fri: work 1:30 to 6:15 pm Sat: work 4:15 to 9 am, then  X-Men Evolution  9:30-10:00, then sleep Sun: church 'til 1:30ish  So Starbucks (I don't know if it's just my store or it's district-wide) has decided to start opening a half-hour earlier and close an hour later.  Hence my Saturday shift will begin at 4:15  am .  That means that I have to get up... really early.  I think I'll just set my TV to go off at 3 am, which is when ST:Voyager is on.  Hah.  Theoretically, I could even watch the whole episode before heading off to work.  Baby-sitting for my cousin (I should make a correction, he is 3.75 yrs old, not 4) was... well, hard in its own way.  He's not a hyper kid, so he's not really the type to run around.  In fact, I'm kinda worried that he doesn't run around more.  He's the only toddler I know that claims to be "tired."  Even after breakfast, he likes to play in bed.  But that doesn't make it easier.  Instead, he's a constant chatterbox.  He likes to tell stories and show you stuff and ask questions, and you've got to respond to all of it or else he gets more pesky.  I tried reading around him, and he doesn't like it when you're not constantly paying attention to him.  So yeah, no running around, but no free time, either.  At least he's toilet-trained now.  Hey Keno, if I ever visit you in SanJo, I'll show you how to make a caramel macchiato (one of the more popular drinks).  You just need to get vanilla syrup and caramel sauce.  And if you get mocha syrup, I can show you how to make a mocha or even a hot chocolate.  My aunt and uncle suggested I think about becoming a corporate lawyer cuz they thought I really liked to study.  And while I do like learning stuff (hey, Discovery alone would be worth it to get cable) I told them I don't like having to study things I don't like.  I mean, I had a pretty hard time writing those research papers in college.  Not a hard time thinking up what to write (Queen of the BS) but more of getting the motivation to do it.  I told them I was considering becoming a computer graphics artist.  My uncle responded very positively, which he usually does (I think mainly due to being white and having been a teen in the 60's.)  My aunt, on the other hand, responded in her usual stoic manner.  She obviously wasn't going to insult my choice, but I could tell that she thought that was beneath me.  No matter how white-washed she may get, deep-down she's still a Korean mother.  However, as we were watching  The Two Towers  later and I mentioned how Gollum was entirely computer-generated, she said, hey, you could do that.  If I told her what the average salary for that was, she'd probably get that stoic look again.  Anyway, how cool would it be to work on a movie like  The Lord of the Rings !  Anyway, since in the past they have suggested that I become a teacher (due to my having worked at that academy and Kaplan, and my "natural talent" with children), I realize that they probably don't know me as well as they think.  But... at least they're trying to help.  Quite ironically, for a few months after I graduated, my mom repetitively suggested that since I like to read and write I should become a lawyer.  Perhaps Erica can enlighten me, but isn't 80% of lawyering generating paperwork and filing a buncha stuff w/ the appropriate government department, and 20% public-speaking?  I don't think enjoyment of reading novels and writing pulp means you'll enjoy being a lawyer.

						   Retreat was a blast!  I really like that it was held at a hotel.  It was pretty relaxing as well as fun.  The family feud game was hilarious.  One category was "Fruit that's the Easiest to Eat" and the guy up rang in and said, "Mango."  Suffice it to say, everybody ribbed him good-naturedly for the rest of the night.  Another category that came up while my team was up was "What You Would Do if There was No Toilet Paper in a Public Restroom."  That produced some... interesting answers.  Anyway, the retreat was refreshing, as well, spiritually.  Yeah, it's like that at every retreat, almost.  But that's what retreats are for!  And while blasphemous thoughts still invade my mind, it's good to know that in the end, Jesus Christ is my lord and savior, no matter what.  Actually, the verse that really helped was Psalm 84:11 --  For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.   The speaker said that since God will not withhold anything good, then perhaps the reason you don't have something is because it's not good for you at the moment.  Anyway, here's my schedule for the rest of the week:  Today: School all day and then heading over to my aunt's in Rolling Hills Thursday: Baby-sitting my cousin 'til about 2 pm, and then work from 6:45 to 10:45 pm, then head back to Rolling Hills Friday: Baby-sitting my cousin 'til about 2 pm, and then work from 7:45 to 11:45 pm Saturday: Work from 1 to 5 pm Sunday: Church until about 1:30 pm  In case you didn't realize, I'm doing some hecka crazy driving this week.  It's cuz my aunt in a panic (well, she never panicks outwardly) saying that Ryan's (my 4-yr-old cousin) school won't start 'til next week and they've been left w/o childcare for him this week since they thought that his school started right after Labor Day like other schools.  If I could've gotten rid of my Thursday shift so I wouldn't have to drive back home and back, then I would have, but I was left without much time to arrange things.  So... they owe me big?  Nah, I'm feeling charitable this week. :)

						   It's hard to believe that at one point, our house was only about ten miles away from the fires.  I've been watching the news and reading the newspapers, and it's pretty bad.  Starbucks is organizing volunteers among the partners, and I'm going to see if I can help out.  The Red Cross is asking for a lot of things, one of which I really want to give but can't.  Since it's been less than a month since I last  urlLink gave blood , I can't for another few weeks.  But San Bernardino County is really short.  So I'm asking you all to help:   Please donate blood.   I know some of you can't, but for those of you who can but won't, please consider this as a favor to me.  Thanks.

						   New updated schedule (accurate this time!):  Wed -- school Thu -- 2:45 to 6:45 pm Fri -- 6:30 pm to 12:15 am  (anybody have a good  cheap  costume idea?) Sat -- 12:30 pm to 4:45 pm Sun -- church, then 7 to 11:15 pm  So now that I'm finally working (somewhat) why am I still keeping vampire hours?  It started with catching up on some taped shows from last week, and then I expected to sleep in on a Tuesday morning, for once, but then at 7:30 I get a call from work asking me to come in.  So I work for 3.5 hours, and then I come home, crash, and wake up in darkness.  I know I said that December is my favorite month and that I prefer winter over summer, but there's one thing about winter that I absolutely hate.  You'll probably read me rant about it for weeks on end, which usually happens after the time change, but I don't like the early sunset.  Maybe it's because I tend to suffer from mild SAD (seasonal affective disorder) around this time.  Nothin' much more to say, so I'll just rant: The new Toys-R-Us commercials:  There is no helium in a hot-air balloon! Justin Timberlake:  It's "with you" not "wit chu"! Beyonce:  No rant, I just really hate the song "Baby Boy," and what the heck was she doing at the RMAs? The RMAs:  That was a really really REALLY pointless awards show! TV movies:  I can't believe they've already greenlighted a movie about the Cubs fan who caught that ball!  'kay, that's it.

						   So the sky is falling in Southern California.  Flames lick at our borders, a rain of ash falls steadily, and today's setting sun was an eery bright red.  I think the Apocalypse has come.  The first sign was when we elected an inexperienced action movie star as governor.  Recent spending has left my finances stretched to the limit.  Perhaps I shouldn't have bought that Wacom tablet from Ebay.  I don't  necessarily  need it, but drawing with the tablet versus the mouse is like the difference between a sable brush and a crayola poster paint brush.  *sigh.  If only being an artist could be cheaper.  My biggest expense?  Entertainment.  I mean, I don't regret any of the spending on that, but boy, it does take its toll.  I saw  Mystic River  for a class assignment.  It's pretty good.  We had a long discussion about who was the hero, because from the beginning, Sean Penn's character is seen as the hero while Tim Robbins's character is the villain.  But the story is complex, and we had a long discussion about whether or not the hero of a story has to be a good guy.  Last week's  Smallville  was a letdown, after all those commercials about Clark and Lana skinny-dipping.  I mean, it was classic Smallville, but I was expecting something big.  Waiting for sweeps, I guess.   Angel  was pretty good, too.  The writing was classic Whedon, with such gems as Fred pretending to be scared by Spike to spare his feelings, and Spike crying out, "Hey, I invented what-goes-bump-in-the-night."  I still have a few more hours of TV to catch up on.  Sad, yes, I know.  This is why I shouldn't start watching new shows.   X-Men: Evolution  is coming along interestingly in terms of storyline.  I liked it better when it was more "mutants in high school" cuz otherwise it's going to be too much like the early 90's  X-Men  cartoon.  (I really hated the voices on there, esp Xavier and Wolverine cuz they sounded all squeaky.)  But they had a preview of Rogue's new powers (it'll be interesting how she develops them, since in the comics she's supposed to have got them before she came to the Institute), as well as Jean's turn as Phoenix.  I just hope they won't go all soap-opera-melodramatic-exploded-universe like the earlier cartoon.  Ach, too much TV.  My schedule for this week (it's not exact as I don't have it written in front of me):  Mon -- school Tue -- no work! Wed -- school Thu -- 4:15 to 8:45 am (I'm not sure about this one) Fri -- 8:15 pm to 12:15 am (It may start earlier) Sat -- 11:30 to 4 pm Sun -- church, then 7 to 11:15 pm

						   I learned an interesting thing last week that I haven't posted yet:  I am the oldest person at my store.  Well, there might be one other girl who is also 24, but otherwise, I am the oldest.  Yes, I am older than my married-with-a-4-year-old-daughter store manager.  Apparently, she' only 23.  Everybody else is 19 to 22, except one guy who is only 17.  At the Chino Hills store, I think the ages of the baristas are a bit higher on average (there are a lot more married women) but it's still pretty young.  When I had that temp job in Ontario, I met one 24-yr-old who was married with a baby, and one who seemed younger than me who already had two kids (she had her first at 15).  It's really weird for me and I can't relate cuz when I was 19, I was barely growing up but these girls were having babies.  But I realize that that's the norm more than the exception.  But we don't see that on TV cuz, with the exception of  Roseanne , working class people just ain't funny.  The Albertson's strike is causing the Holiday rush to start early.  The morning rush started early today, and it was absolutely crazy.  But at least that means I'm getting more hours.  I'm scheduled to work the closing shift on Halloween.   Fun.   They're encouraging us to dress up, but I'm not sure what to wear.  I was thinking of just drawing a lightning scar on my forehead and putting tape on my glasses.  Anyway, from past experiences, they say that it'll be quiet early on while the parents are out trick-or-treating with their kids, but afterwards... mad rush to wash the evening away with coffee.  Yikes.  Okay, so tired... and Erica where are you???

						   This week's schedule:  Mon -- School Tue -- 7:30 am to 12ish (forgot the exact time) Wed -- School Thu -- 4:15 to 8:45 am Fri -- 4:15 to 9 am, church activity at 7:30 pm Sat -- nuthin' though I've been called in to work the past two weeks Sun -- church  I am soooo old now cuz I've hurt my back... again.  I think it was when I reached for something high and I over-stretched a muscle.  Ouch.  My dad massaged it last night (more like abused it) but it felt ok this morning.  It just got worse in the air-conditioned school building.  Last Saturday I picked up a shift at the store in Chino Hills.  Even though we're only like a mile apart, there's a big world of difference.  For one thing?  People tip better.  I can certainly understand why they figure it's an additional buck an hour.  The last two times I picked up my tips, it was less than that.  The clientele there is different, too.  The ethnic makeup of our two cities are similar, but instead of Mexicans, they have Asians.  And lots of Koreans.  I've never seen so many Korean customers in the six hours I was there.  There's also news regarding my church that most of you won't care about.  But nevertheless, I have to write about it.  Though it's still tentative, there may be a split at our church.  More like, the EM (English Ministry -- basically the 1.5 to 2nd generation English-speaking Koreans) is going to split away from the church.  Oof.  I'm leaning towards leaving with them but not without hesitation.  After all, I do have history there, even if there isn't much loyalty.  And my parents attend the KM (Korean Ministry), even though from what I hear things ain't very Christian.  One of the things that Paul (the apostle, St. Paul to the Catholics) really frowned upon was gossip, and unfortunately, Korean culture is rampant with it.  It would take severe, conscious effort to get rid of it, and they haven't made any move towards it.  Even my mom hates that the only thing they do whenever there's a get-together is gossip.  But I thought, ok, we're separate ministries, I think ours is very Bible-oriented and people are making a big effort at Paul's request ( urlLink Romans 12:1-2 ), I feel people are actually growing spiritually there.  However, we learned that the politics of the KM have been leaking into the EM, and things have come to a showdown.  I really hope we don't have to tear our congregation apart.  BTW, yes I'm a hypocrite.  I'm not like the church I attend.  But I'd rather attend this church than a more liberal one, just cuz I know this church can keep me from going overboard.  But I like my role as wrench-thrower just so that the other people around me aren't just taking the conservative stance cuz the church is.  ************  (huff puff)  Whew, dodged the bullet there!  I forgot that my parking meter had run out an hour ago.  I rushed out and luckily, no parking ticket!  Whoo-hoo!  I think I'll end my blog on this happy note. :)

						   Actually, Beno, it's not stolen since we all get a free pound of coffee per week.  But it's suppose to be for personal consumption, not for selling.  I think.  And Count Whateley, yes, I'm thankful for your generosity, I'm just saying I don't think it was worth $40 in general.  Update on this week's schedule:  So I didn't go to the meeting today cuz my manager let me skip it and go to the Chino Hills store meeting instead.  So...  Thu -- 6:45 to 10:45 pm (I found out the actual time) Fri -- 4:15 to 9:00 am, and then meeting probably around 6 or 7  But... I'm still open Saturday, so please come visit me!  Let's hang out!  Unless you're a creepy stalker!  BTW, the link Count Whateley provided is sooooooo creepy.  They actually have memorials to Matthew Shepard and Diane Whipple about them going to hell.  I felt really angry and really sad.  Such Pharisees....  That, ladies and gentlemen, is why Christians are not trusted in this country.  Those bigots and hatemongers give Jesus a bad name.  On a lighter note, we saw  Casablanca  in class today.  It's so weird.  I've never seen the movie before, yet I knew so many of the lines cuz they've been quoted so much.  Our teacher said to take a closer look at it again to note the way the filmmaking was done.  There's a lot of subtleties in filmmaking that go virtually unnoticed.  It's kinda hard when we're storyboarding just how it's so easy to mess up, yet when the finished product comes out, if it's well done, you hardly notice anything.  Perhaps one day I can call myself an expert in this field.  Ok, I'm getting kicked out of the computer lab now.

						   Last Saturday night I went to Knott's Halloween Haunt (more commonly known as Knott's Scary Farm) with Robert and his date.  Our group was supposed to include her friend and her boyfriend, but they ditched us, so it ended up being a threesome.  I so need a man.  (ha ha... ha)  Anyway, it was a fun experience, though I don't think worth the $40 ticket.  I'm thinking it would be fun to work as a monster there, though as the kind that walks around, not the kind stuck inside a haunted house.  The lines were rather long, though some weren't as long as they claimed.  The show we watched was pretty good so I think if I ever go again (which... will be in another 10 years?) I'll watch the shows rather than go through the haunted houses.  I started pre-emptedly screaming before a turn just to prepare myself for getting spooked.  But towards the end, I figure out, they're more likely to jump out at you if you look them in the eye or touch the walls.  I came home at 3:30 am, crashed, and woke up in time to be late to church... as usual.  But afterwards, I felt odd -- I was tired but I couldn't fall asleep.  I did fall asleep around midnight and woke up around 10 am.  So now I've got one of those slept-too-much headaches.  Such ironies.  Y'know what sucks about Knott's Scary Farm?  Too damn many couples making out in lines.  You know who you are!  Schedule for the week: Mon -- school Tue -- 4:15 to 8:45 am Wed -- skipping school, meeting 5:30 to 7:30 w/ betta-be-worth-four-dolla dinner Thur -- afternoon shift (forgot the time) Fri -- 4:15 to 8:45 am Sat -- forgot... nuthin', I think Sun -- church in morn

						   Short post in regards to comments:  Thanks for the link, You-Know-Who, but it's not helpful as I am not living in the Bay Area.  The entertainment industry, for the most part, is in Los Angeles.  Anyway, as for the work meeting, it's on everybody's schedule, so we're getting paid for it, it's like a shift, yadda yadda, I just hope it's worth it.  They say that we're going out to dinner afterwards.  I wonder if enough people wanted to donate $4 out of their tips to pay for it.  I certainly wasn't going to donate.  Let the leads, who have more hours and higher wages, make the donations.  Speaking of hours, due to the store manager's daughter being sick today, I got extra hours.  Now that's a new experience.  I actually got 8 hours, though I may end up getting an extra five minutes in overtime.  One bad thing?  I think I got jacked out of a 10 min break.  What's the law for 8 hours, cuz I just got a paid 10 and an unpaid 30-min lunch?  One thing I figured out, the rate of fun at work depends on who you're working with.  I figured that out.  Even Starbucks can be bearable with the right people.

						   Stupid enetations!  You can't click the submit button more than once, or reload the page, without it posting your comment multiple times.  Erg.  Anyway, I don't know how God works, and I'm not sure if he's telling me something, but it turns out, the two classes I have on Wednesdays does not physically require my presence next week.  I mean, I'd be missing out on valuable work time and I'd have to call other people for the homework assignment, but I don't have to turn anything in next week.  So that means that I can skip next Wednesday to attend my store's holiday meeting.  Yep, I'm skipping school to attend a  meeting .  Aye caramba.    The store manager stressed that it's reeeeally important, and that if I do miss it, then I'd have to spend a couple of hours with her one-on-one to make up for it.  Other people are just going to skip their classes, but  they  don't drive all the way out to frickin' Santa Monica.  Funnily enough, the guy who I sit next to in my Storyboarding class turns out is a lead at a Starbucks in Culver City.  He's a lead there, but he says that he's been there too long and looks at it with the same cynicism that I'm starting to cultivate.  It makes me feel better, though, cuz it seems like 4 out of the 5 leads at my stores are waaaaay too gung-ho about Starbucks.  And the one lead that's not is the second-in-command, so he can't really express his cynicism.  What Dante, the guy in my class, told me was that in his store, and at various stores around Hollywood and LA, they get celebrity regulars.  For instance, John Travolta used to be a regular at his store.  So when he asked me if we had any celebrity regulars, I just replied, it's Chino, the closest person we've got to a celebrity is the mayor.  (Not that I even know who that is, though he did come on the news when that whole thing about  The OC  was going on.)  Y'know what I'm thinking?  I oughtta transfer to a store in Hollywood or LA.  Cuz in addition to celebrities, producers, directors, and scriptwriters are regulars at some stores.  And as I've learned for weeks at my Storytelling class, the key to getting employment is networking.  But... I'm sure you see the problem here.  There's no way I could afford to live on my own on Starbucks wages.  Even if I do sell my pound-o-coffee-per-week on the side.

						   Okay, so  Holes  the movie isn't as good as  Holes  the book, but since Louis Sachar also wrote the screenplay, it's pretty damn close.  As my brother can attest to (and he's pretty finicky when it comes to movies) it's a good movie.  And I attest, it's a damn good book.  Damn.  Hell.  Yeah.  (Geez people, do I have to buy them for you for Christmas?)  Well, there is one problem with the movie and basically it's why a book can't completely translate into a movie.  The story is about Stanley Yelnats (it's a palindrome) and his adventure, but there are tons of backstories on his great-great-grandfather, his great-grandfather, on his friend Zero, and the history of Camp Greenlake, and the clever thing is how they all inter-relate.  But when you translate that into a movie, you've got a ton of characters and a lot of explanations that you have to make sure gets understood.  So a lot of the subleties were lost.  And it's the subtleties that make it a great book.  Changing the subject, the wedding yesterday of a church member was pretty good.  It was the first "Korean" wedding where I actually knew the people getting married and they weren't relatives.  All you Korean people know what I mean when I say "Korean" wedding, but for you non-Korean-folk, basically, the main difference is, it's usually held at a church, the mothers are in han-boks and light the candles in the beginning, the bride-and-groom have that unity candle-lighting ceremony, they both wear gloves, there was a Korean buffet, and no dancing.  It was all quick and over with in under 3 hours, though I came early and stayed later to help.  I had woken up at 4 am yesterday, actually, to be at work by 4:45.  After I was done, I wanted to take a nap, but I couldn't because of errands and whatnot, and I was trying to get to the church as early as possible to help.  At the end of the day, I was so tired that I fell asleep for a second on the exit ramp for home.  I watched a bit of TV, but I was so tired that I ended up going to bed around 9:30, though I was interrupted twice by phone calls.  (Sorry Erica)  I was hoping that going to bed early could help me wake up earlier to do my Bible study before church, but I ended up waking up later than usual, so not only did I just throw on some clothes and makeup, but I was so late that I missed out on praise.  And I'm feeling tired still.  Bleh.  My schedule for next week:  Mon  --  school Tue -- 4:15 to 9 am Wed -- school Thu -- 4:15 to 9 am Fri -- 2 to 6 pm Sat -- nuthin'  (maybe I'll go hiking in the morning) Sun -- church then homework  Saturday's shift had a lead that I haven't worked with, because otherwise I would remember her stickler-for-the-rules attitude.  It seems like every move I made required correction.  She did complement me once, though.  The thing is, it didn't seem any more than usual, but it just seemed that way cuz the way she talked was a lot like how the boss guy did in  Office Space .  I don't know if they train leads to talk that way, but there's another one that talks like that, too.  And since it's snapshot season (snapshot=secret shopper report), it's going to be worse.  I wouldn't mind getting out of retail.  If only tutoring was more steady.  Like if I could get 10 to 20 hours of it a week or something.  I'm seriously considering whether or not medical, stocks, and discounts is enough of an incentive to stay.

						   That bruise on the donation spot isn't so big.  I have a slight soreness in that elbow joint, but I think that's from work and not the needle.  Sometimes, when I'm tamping the espresso grounds (which means that I'm using this little thing to press down hard on the individual brewer) and my arm is at a 90-degree angle with my elbow facing up and my upper-arm parallel to the ground, I feel a little tingle right above my elbow.  Kinda like when you stretch and your joints pop.  Anyway, it doesn't hurt, but I wonder if it will lead to something.  There was this whole thing about repetitive-stress injury prevention that we had to read, but a lot of it is hard to put into practice.  The only one we seem to be doing is not working the bar for more than 30 mins at a time, though I think that has to do more with the customer flow than anything else.  And they kicked me out 45 mins early yesterday, and an hour and 20 mins early today!  This sucks.  It seems like an obsession with the manager/leads to save labor hours.  So meanwhile, I'm getting less than 18 hrs a week, and next week it's even worse.  Sigh.  On a different note, I watched  Bowling for Columbine  last week (Robert's DVD), and it's a really good documentary.  And it raises a lot of thoughtful questions.  What was especially an interesting point was that of the developed countries that have less than 150 gun-related deaths (or is it homicides) per year, Canada doesn't have strict gun-control and in fact has more guns per capita than the US.  Yet the US has over eleven-thousand gun deaths per year, while they have around 115.  I also rented a couple of DVDs cuz I had a coupon that expired on Tuesday.  I've only watched one, which is  Bend It Like Beckham .  It's a pretty good movie, though I had to turn on the subtitles after 5 mins cuz I had a hard time understanding what they were saying.  Reminds me of Kelly Bundy taking an English-to-English dictionary on their family trip to England.  I think it hit home with a lot of young people, because no matter which culture you come from, especially if you are dual-cultured, when what you want and what your parents want are different, problems (and possibly hilarity) ensues.  I did learn a new term, though.  Slag is British for slut, I'm assuming.  So perhaps I'll go around calling people bloody slags.  Heh heh.  One more thing, there is a reason why Starbucks is making bank.  A tall drip (the small size) is $1.40.  The cost of the coffee is approximately 8&#162;, and the cost of the cup is 10&#162;, and if we assume the lid and the sleeve add up to 5&#162;, and since it takes 2 min for a Barista to take the order and fill the cup and give it to the customer (which is about 22&#162;), then the profit for each tall drip is 95&#162;, or 68% profit.  (BTW, this is a low estimate, since one of the leads said that the net profit from drip coffee is the price - 8&#162;, which would be a 94% profit.)   Next time, I'm getting soy in all my drinks.  Normally they charge 30&#162; extra.  I think for my slightly-above-minimum-wage wage, I deserve soy.  Besides, I don't need a reason for my lactose intolerance to flare up.

						   Boy do I have a story for you today.  So I actually picked up the SMC weekly newspaper  The Corsair  during the break of my first class.  Well, in there was an article about how the refridgeration system of the Irvine Red Cross Blood Bank had failed and they ended up with a blood-shortage crisis.  Anyway, in order to restock the supply, they are holding a blood mobile drive on the main campus today and tomorrow.  Well, not having given blood since 9/11, I figured this was a good enough cause to take the shuttle to the main campus and impart some of my precious bodily fluid.  One thing, I don't know why, but donating blood takes a minimum of one hour, even though the actual donation process takes only about 10-15 mins.  It's not even just answering the questions, filling out the paperwork, and taking your vitals.  It's that there's a long wait in between each step.  Anyway, I only had an hour to donate before the last shuttle left, so it was cutting it close, but I felt convicted about this cause.  Anyway, while I was waiting, I had my sandwich and some water.  And after an hour, I finally went in to donate.  (At which point I realized that taking the shuttle back was now out, and I'll have to walk the 1.25 miles back.)  Well, here's my mistake.  You're suppose to be well-hydrated, but the only water I had up to that point was the half-liter bottle water with my sandwich.  A half-liter is approximately a pint, and a pint is what I had to donate.  For those of you medically inclined, you might have guessed it.  I tend to bleed pretty slowly.  I normally have low blood pressure.  And I didn't drink enough water.  So, after a painful 30 mins, I had just 43 mL to go 'til I filled the bag, and the plebotemists were massaging my arm and hand to get my circulation up, when my vein collapsed.  Argh.  All that pain and trouble, and they can't even use that bag.  (Which sucks cuz even though it's not regulation-sized, it's still good blood.)  And afterwards, I had to sit around with an ice bag strapped to my arm while the nurse told me that I'm going to have a big bruise tomorrow.  The lesson?  Drink a lot of water while waiting to donate blood!  I kept asking complete strangers if they could give me a ride to the Academy campus since I didn't want to pass out in the middle of my 20-min walk.  But in the end, I didn't pass out, although I was more than a half-hour late for my class.  But even though this donation was a lot of trouble, I will donate again!  There is always a blood shortage in California, and even though I'm A+ and therefore not as useful as an O-, I will try to give whenever possible.  So for you sissies out there (you know who you are!), the pain is minimal compared to the good you'll do, so donate!  They've already got so many limitations on who can donate (just added SARS and West Nile, in addition to Mad Cow which eliminates western Europe) that if I can, I'd feel guilty if I'm not.  Besides, they give you cookies!  On a different note, fun links:  urlLink Map to Mordor   urlLink Project Genesis

						   Thanksgiving was pretty good.  I tried to pawn off some shifts on other people but no bites.  Sigh.  I had a major headache on Thursday, so in the middle of the day I took a three-hour nap while the kids around me played.  Well, the headache was probably due to not getting enough sleep the night before.  But I guess my immune system was weak enough because that night my throat started to tickle, and Friday I woke up with my head splitting open and major nasal blockage.  To make it worse, I switched shifts with someone to do her a favor, and so I ended up working two more hours than scheduled.  And yet, no one will take my Sunday shift off my hands.    Why don't people return calls?  It seems like I've left so many friggin' messages and not a one has called back.  When someone leaves me a message, I usually call them back.  And if part of their message is asking me to call them back, then I definitely call them back.  Usually right then and there.  There was this one guy at work who I asked to take my Friday shift, and he said that he would call back the next day, and he didn't!  He thought he would wait until the day before (Thanksgiving Day) to call back.  I mean, wouldn't that be worse?  I asked people to just leave me a message yet no one did.  How hard is it to just say, "sorry I can't" ???  Maybe it's because they are all young'uns, but this is one life lesson that I will definitely have to teach them.  After all, if I was their boss or a potential employer, I would not put up with that crap.    Anyway, I think I just have a cold and not the flu (though they say if you've had the flu shot, then if do you get the flu, the symtoms are milder), but I'm trying to stay away from medication.  Hopefully, this will mean that I won't get sick again for months, and perhaps avoid getting sick all winter.  One can only hope.  My schedule this week: Mon -- school Tue -- 12:15 to 4:30 pm Wed -- school, though skipping last class to go to 3D seminar Thu -- 2:30 to 10:30 pm Fri -- 11:45 am to 3:45 pm Sat -- no work, though they might call me Sun -- church, then lots of homework

						   Okay, okay.  For those who actually commented, thanks.  I shouldn't get all worked up over that.  Homework due tomorrow.  Sigh.  It's gonna be another long night.  I had an interesting experience last Saturday night.  I went with a few friends to watch a hypnotist show followed by an improv show.  When the hypnotist was asking for volunteers, one of my friends and I just high-tailed it for the stage.  It's not that big of a stage or audience.  Anyway, so it was my first time ever getting hypnotized.  What does it feel like?  Well, my heart was pounding cuz I was really nervous, but other than that, I was just really, really, really relaxed.  I don't think I went under as deep as I could, though.  At the very beginning, they had you imagine that your hands are filled with helium and rising through the air.  Well, I was trying, but it wasn't working, so the guy just lifted my right hand, and  it started to float !  But that was about the last time that my body did something without my control.  Alright, I'll admit it, I did fake it a bit.  But I'm not sure if that's really faking it.  Mainly, you can hear everything that the guy says, and you're fully conscious and aware.  So whenever he implanted suggestions to me, basically, it came down to, well, y'know what, I think I'll do what he said to do.  Pretty much, if I didn't want to, then I wouldn't have.  I hear that to be hypnotized, you have to want to be hypnotized.  And I really wanted to, too.  I guess I just wasn't as under as much.  Anyway, pretty much, when he told me to do something, I just decided, okay, I will.  And my body just complied, like it was just itching for me to do it.  So that's why I think I was half-hypnotized.  My friend had barely any memory of the performance, though.  That's probably why she was a lot funnier.  There were a couple of guys that were  really  under.  They were hilarious.  I'm going to try to go again, and next time, I won't have a martini before the show.  I think being slightly under the influence kept me from fully going under.  Well, that and they took my glasses and I couldn't see him.  But then,  it was dimly lit, so maybe no one was suppose to and it doesn't matter if you can see him or not.  Anyway, I felt really good and relaxed afterwards (and they say that a lot of people feel the effects hours or days) but it wore off after the improv show afterwards (an hour).  The other people were asking me if I remember doing this or that.  And you know what?  Yes I do.  Everything.  Even what other people did.  My other friend that went under barely remembered anything.  I want to have a period of blacked out memory!  Hee hee.   Happy  Thanksgiving   everybody.

						   Dang it.  New item for my shopping list: a battery-operated alarm clock.  I stayed up late finishing a project last night (sigh... why do I procrastinate so?  And why do I let myself get distracted by the web?) so of course my internal clock (which barely works, btw) didn't wake me up for the usual Wednesday morning schedule.  That wouldn't matter so long as my alarm clock and TV (it has a timer) worked.  But... around 9 am this morning, there must have been a short blackout, because it was 2 pm when I woke up.  My class starts at 12:30 pm.  Sigh.  I'm normally late to this class, but never this late.  I just got ready as best I could and tried to beat the traffic to Santa Monica.  I don't think it was worth it to make it to the last half-hour of a four-hour class.  I could try to post my project for all to see, but it's just a video of a script I didn't write and footage I didn't shoot.  I'm just the editor.  I will, however, post my Flash project that was done a couple of weeks ago.  As soon as I get around to it.  Which might be never.  Gotta go.  Here's hoping for no parking tickets.

						   Last night I had one of those... epiphanies?  I'm not sure if that's the right word.  So after being late to work (again), one of my co-workers invited us to his house afterwards to hang out.  I wasn't sure if I was actually wanted or if they were asking out of politeness (mainly due to my being late that day, and it's the lead that I get a less-than-warm response from) but I went anyway.  I was only there for a little over an hour, but it was good.  I just listened to them talk about people I didn't know.  Anyway, one thing came out.  Everybody else (or at least the four other people there) didn't like the Stickler Lead.  So... a part of me was happy, so I knew it wasn't just me.  And it was kinda fun listening to them complain about her.  But then they made fun of her for being a "church girl."  (Well, it was a little more explicit than that.  Basically they were laughing at her for being the v-word.)  That's when I stopped laughing.  Suddenly, I realized that the others were faulting her for her "good" qualities.  And that's when I examined my dislike of her, and I realized that, while her methods are brusque and condescending sometimes, they were essentially "good" qualities.  I mean, how can you call "following the rules" a bad personality trait?  So tonight, when I worked with her, the shift went by a lot better.  Well, for one, I was making less mistakes and she seemed less "peering-over-my-shoulder."  But mainly, I accepted that with her there will be no "giving of breaks," "cutting of slacks," or even good old-fashioned camaderie.  But those are not bad qualities and she is not a bad person.  Now, it will still frustrate me when she corrects my every little mistake or throw away those beautiful leftover pastries, but I just have to accept that as the kind of character she has.  Weird.  Y'know what bugs me?  I wish I had spoken up, saying that being a "church girl" isn't a bad thing.  That it's a good thing.  But, alas, my human's sinful desires (acceptance and belonging) kept me from doing so.  It's that whole, evil persists when good men stay silent thing.  Sigh.  It's not my fault.   Mea culpa.  I'm not to blame.   Mea culpa.  It is the gypsy girl the witch who sent this flame.   Mea maxima culpa.  It's not my fault.   Mea culpa.  If in God's plan,   Mea culpa.  He made the devil so much stronger than a man.   Mea maxima culpa.   On a side note, the official church split happened today as we held the first service of the newly reformed Pillar Bible Church.  I was able to attend both Dong Shin EM as well as Pillar, but next week... no more Dong Shin.   Kyrie Eleison.

						    urlLink Batman Fights the Joker, an Alien, and a Predator   If that ain't cool, I don't know what is.  You need broadband to access the movies (unless you want to download overnight).  The "Making of" featurette is pretty cool, too.  The premise?  It's comic books come to life.  Those of you at ComicCon this year might have already seen it.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------    I started that paragraph a coupla days ago and thought I'd get back to it a little later.  Well... it's now two days later.  But it still holds true.  I came into work this morning to find that Santa came and exploded in our store.  Sometimes, there is such a thing as too much red.  We started playing holiday music, too, and want to take bets on how long it'll be before I go completely nuts from hearing it over and over?  And who are we kidding?  Hannukah is over long before Christmas, Islam and Hinduism and Buddhism and many other major religions have no holiday in December, and the only other religion to have a holiday in December is the Wiccan Yule, which the Catholic church took over to keep the masses from celebrating a pagan holiday in the first place.  So when we say  holiday  decorations and  holiday  music and  holiday  coffee blend, we mean Christmas.  Though they do package 'em in different colors other than red for those "other" holidays.  And what about Thanksgiving?  What happened to that?  Well, being thankful for what you have doesn't inspire you to shop.  We hired two more people at the store, plus a new assistant manager and a Retail-Management Trainee, mainly because several people were suppose to leave to start up the store in Pomona.  Well, the opening date got pushed back several weeks, so now we all don't have any hours.  Sigh.  The least they could do is give me an extra hour a week devoted entirely to just deep cleaning.  I got assigned two tasks instead of one, and I don't even have any time to do one during the week.  In fact, I haven't been able to do any at all since I got hired.  What do they want?  I'm thinking they're expecting us to come in on our own time to do it.  Off the clock, I mean.  Hell no.  Not for seven bucks an hour.  Our last week's tips came to be only 92 cents per hour (of which 50 will be taxed come April), and it looks like the 6 hours I worked at the Chino Hills one won't let me get a chunk of their tip bounty.  Sure, it would only be about 6-7 bucks, but that would have bought me lunch (at school) for a week.  Anybody else get more of the Six Degrees of Denise Richards?

						   Denise Richards to Eugene Levy:  Denise Richards was in "Wild Things" with Matt Dillon who was in "In & Out" with Joan Cusack who was in "Gross Pointe Blank" with John Cusack who was in "Serendipity" with Eugene Levy.  Five.  Whoo-hoo.  My secret weapon?   urlLink IMDB .  I got a flu shot yesterday.  It's still a bit sore.  Boy, I'm getting poked a lot by my school.  But this morning the lead was sick with the flu, but since nobody came to cover for her, she ended up coming to work after I called her.  It takes 3-4 weeks for the flu vaccine to take effect.  I just hope she wasn't contagious.  I made a conscious effort not to touch my mouth and nose.  BTW, peppermint white mocha -- pretty good.

						   I am now officially certified to handle food in San Bernardino County.  Whoo.  Actually, it was rather enlightening, the class.  A lot of the prevention methods were pretty obvious (keep hot foods hot, cold foods cold, and keep meat, eggs, and dairy away from other foods), but some of the specifics of the county health code was pretty interesting.  For instance, everyone is suppose to keep their hair covered.  And did you know that 2/3 of all botulism cases end in death?  And ordinary cooking heat can't even kill it.  Oh, and there's no such thing as a "24-hr flu."  It is most likely food poisoning.  Thank you to y'all that have given, or tried to give, blood.  The next time I do, I'll share all the painful details here.  It was a crazy week.  I had two projects due (one of which I took all night Sun night/Monday morning), as well as half a storyboard that I couldn't finish last week, and I've been really tired due to not getting enough sleep from early work schedules.  Well, early enough that I don't get enough sleep but late enough that I can't nap afterwards.  Last night was the first night in days that I got a full rest.  But you know what's the sad part?  Some of that was self-created.  I gotta stop keeping up with certain shows.  Well, that and I'm fascinated by David Letterman's new baby.  I'm closing again tonight.  Let's see if I come home with any pastries.  The last bunch was eaten with great gusto.  They may be pricey, but I do have to say, they are delicious.  The new eggnog latte is pretty good, but I'm not too crazy about eggnog.  Not too crazy about gingerbread, either.  The peppermint mocha was pretty good, but I prefer white mocha.  Perhaps tonight I'll try a peppermint white mocha.  Peppermint chai?  Hmmm.

						   Thanks Erica for your willingness.  Now for the rest of you,  urlLink please donate blood !  It's been a long time since I've  urlLink dressed up  for Halloween, but I thought everybody at work was going to dress up.  Turns out, I was the only one for awhile, and then an hour after my shift started, someone else came on dressed as a cat.  Well, more like she was dressed sexy with cat ears.  I know that a lot of Christians (or at least conservative or reform Christians) think that Halloween is a satanic holiday though it's roots are pagan pre-Christian and early Catholic.  I suppose the only reason to not celebrate it is for 1 Corinthian 8 reasons.  But it's really fun to dress up, and since I came to the US when I was six and didn't actually go trick-or-treating 'til I was eleven (and then stopped at thirteen), I've never had a chance to do costume-y things.  So as a Christian, when else do I get a chance to wear costumes?  Party City was jam-packed today.  I ended up spending more money than I should on stuff that I couldn't use.  The only thing I really needed was a $2 make-up kit.  Argh.

						   Double-bar: To have one person pull shots of espresso and fill the cups with syrup while another person steams the milk, tops the drinks, and calls out the drinks to the customers.  Ideally, the two should work in tandem so that the milk should be added right after the espresso is added.  However, since steaming pitchers of milk takes longer than adding the syrups and pulling shots, usually the first person is quicker than the second, leaving a row of half-done drinks at the bar.  The lead, being the first person and having completed his part at the bar, says to the other barista at the register, having no customers at the moment, to help out on bar.  The other barista comes over to the bar, looks at me, the second person at the bar, struggling to steam milk, fill cups, top with whipped cream and mocha/caramel sauce, place lids on cups, clean off milk drips on cups, call out name of person and drink, and place them on the bartop with the oft-requested cardboard sleeves.  She then looks at the half-done drinks, now numbering to almost double-digits, sitting in front of the espresso machine, sees that there's no need for putting syrups in cups or pulling espresso shots (the first person's duties of double-barring), and proclaims:   "There's nothing more to do."   Imagine that.  Meanwhile, a gaggle of customers wait.  A pitcher of milk takes 20-30 seconds to steam, a third of which requires direct handling to create foam, and there must be a separate pitcher for whole, skim, and soy milks.  Whipped cream takes 3 seconds per cup.  Pouring on caramel/mocha sauce takes from 5-10 seconds per cup, more for extra.  Meanwhile, the "rule" is that milk must be added to the cups within ten seconds of the espresso shot.  Do we always follow that rule?  Hah.   "There's nothing more to do."   If I wasn't so busy, I would have yelled at her to help me steam milk, top off drinks, or for heaven's sake just help out by calling out the drinks.  Luckily for her, a customer came up to the register and she was off the hook.  "There's nothing more to do."  I mean, I may be lazy at home, but I'm never so at work.  Cuz for one thing, we're too damn busy all the time.  Even during lulls, there are tons of things that need to be done.  And here is this girl proclaiming, while I am literally struggling with my tasks, that there's nothing more for her to do and she could just relax until the next customer comes.  Not since the Stickler-Lead had I ever gone through a shift so pissed.  And the irony?  Sticker-Lead has left the company.  She "wasn't suited for it."  She may have been bitchy, but at least she wouldn't have tolerated incompetence.  Seriously, why should I care so much about drink quality and keeping the store running smoothly when so many others don't?  Especially from the higher-ups.  I swear, if I don't get a raise or if I get a reprimand during my next job review, I am so going to sue.  Or squeal.  There's no way I'm taking any crap from this store.  Not for what they're paying me.

						   Schedule for rest of week:  Tue -- 1:30 to 5:30 pm Wed -- going over to aunt's in the afternoon Thu -- Happy New Year!  Time for rice-cake soup!  One hopes. Fri -- 1:15 to 5:45 pm, church web-team meeting at 7 pm (tent) Sat -- 7:15 pm to 12:45 am Sun -- church at 10 am, then 5:15 to 10:15 pm  So how was that for Christmas this year!  I'm happy for the rain, but it sucked that the water mixed with the burnt areas caused mudslides.  We spent Christmas Eve/Christmas Day at a cabin in Big Bear that one of my dad's customers lent us.  Beautiful place, but we didn't do much 'cept watch a lot of TV.  (They have cable.)  But it was very low-key.  If it didn't rain, then we coulda done some inner-tube sledding.  On a funny note, even though the cabin was lent to my dad for us to use, our aunts jumped at the opportunity and "joined" us the day after we left.  The kids, I hear, had a blast sledding down the mound of fresh snow deposited in the back yard the night before.  **** FEM ALERT: ALL MEN IGNORE THE NEXT ITALICIZED PARAGRAPH!!! ****   So after a long absence, my "Aunt  Flo" is visiting again.  For those of you that know of my freaky biology, y'know that she's been visiting only every 3 to 4 months since the beginning.  Remember how in the beginning of this year when the visits "normalized" to about every 45 days?  Well, apparently, what's "normal" for others is "freaky" for me.  Cuz y'know how long it's been since Aunt Flo's come a-calling?  Well, I seem to recall a time in late May, and then I was worried that she might come during my sister's wedding in July.  Of course, no fear.  But it's friggin' December!  That's seven months.  Some girls are jealous that I only have to deal with this a few times a year, but it's buggin' the heck outta me since I have no idea when she'll be coming, nor how long she's staying, and if it's going to affect me in the future.  I mean, even if my mom had it similar, she was only a year than me right now when she got married and subsequently popped out the three kids.  I have no idea if this means that I'll be able to have kids in the future.  Sigh.   *****  END FEM ALERT: MEN MAY CONTINUE TO READ ONWARDS  ******  I bet no one actually skipped the above paragraph. :)  I didn't get many presents this year, but that's normal in my family.  Besides, I'd rather my parents not waste the money on useless things.  However, I did get  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Extended Edition DVDs  as well as  Firefly: the Complete Series .  I loved that show.  But as Robert mentioned, it was too complex to hook a large audience.  Pretty much, you had to start watching from the beginning to see the complex story arc beginning for each character, though I thought the individual episodes had enough clever writing to make a complete episode.  Anyway, it was one of those series that required a commitment on the part of the audience, and that's somewhat unrealistic.  But I can't wait for the feature film!  Finally, other people's blogs seem to include a "Year in Review" so I thought I'd hop on the bandwagon:  2003 began the way 2002 began: unemployed.  Well, technically, I was under the employ of Kaplan but just didn't have any classes to teach.  I really liked teaching for Kaplan.  I would like to go back if something can fit my schedule.  I did teach for a hakwon (after school academy) and learned that those places are a bunch of crock.  But they did pay so well....  I began attending  urlLink Santa Monica College , and I'm pretty happy about that decision.  Sure the commute sucks and the lack of resources is discouraging, but I've learned a lot and I feel like I'm making some sort of progress towards my career goal.  I got in a car crash in February.  Erg.  And according to the insurance company, it was 100% my fault.  And well, technically it was since the other cars swerved and missed that truck.  But hey, is it wrong of me to assume that parked cars won't be parked half-way in the driving lane?  I did learn an important lesson, though.  Do not ever take your eyes off the road.  Especially in a city like Santa Monica.  Funny story, though.  I'm deviating from my Review blurb.  Today, someone from my church threw a "women's luncheon" at her apartment in Bellflower.  We ate ddukbogee, odang soup, kimbahp, and fried mandoo, as well as creme brulee.  We played Taboo and had a general good time.  I left an hour before my shift, but luckily traffic wasn't too bad.  I did, however, have to change in the car and then run to the store.  I got there a minute before my shift started.  I was able to change my shirt while driving (during the slow moments).  As I was doing this, I was thinking what people would think if they saw me.  And then I thought if other people also did that while driving.  And then it reminded me of an episode of Mr. Bean that I caught on PBS recently, where he actually did change in his car where he placed a brick on the accelerator, sat in the backseat and steered with his feet (it was a mini) while he put on his outfit, brushed his teeth and used the windshield wiper water shooter to rinse and spit.  Anyway, this year I became involved in my church.  And when it split away from the korean church last month, I went with it.  And resolved to serve the church as much as possible since now it needs all the help it can get.  It is pretty tough attending a rather conservative church, and it's been a struggle to reconcile my personal beliefs with that of the church.  And while there are some quibbles I have, I do think the Bible is a good guide for life and as long as our motives are Biblical, then it would be God's will.  But I need to pray more and study the Bible.  Being involved in my sister's wedding this summer was great, as well as seeing my relatives from Korea.  I've gotta figure out when I can visit over there.  I also learned how stressful a wedding can be, and I can see the reasoning behind eloping.  And most notably, I started my job at Starbucks.  This certainly isn't the most important aspect of my life, but it's the most influential.  After all, I spend more time at work than any other activity, except sleeping.  And since it's my source of income, it affects the other parts of my life, too.  I shouldn't reminisce about my previous jobs, though.  With the exception of that brief stint at Disneyland, I've never worked harder for so little money, and I get a bit nostalgic at my Facility Coordinator pay at W&MF at Cal.  Sigh.  Resolutions/plans/hopes for 2004:  Grow spiritually. Become healthier. Work on my demo reel. Get a job in the industry.  (This is a major hope.) Vegas trip! Korea trip?  And finally... God-willing, to find someone whom I could possibly share the rest of my life with.  But this isn't that great of a desire, since God knows the desires of my heart better than me, and perhaps singlehood (at least for the time being) is better for me than couplehood.  I just have to trust that God is preparing me for that day someday, perhaps never, and I just hope I don't miss it when He's pointing something out to me.  Meanwhile, I hope to become a better daughter, sister, friend, and witness.  This part, I figure, I give up all to God, since I haven't been able to do it by myself.  Okay, this has been a long one.  Thanks for bearing with me.  Happy New Year everybody!

						    urlLink Net Portrait.   The hair is longer, of course, but I figure this is what it would look like if I pulled it back into a low ponytail you couldn't see.  I had a hard time picking the features that looked like mine but were of different scale.  If you want to also give it a go,  urlLink click here.   Really interesting website.  I hope y'all had a merry Christmas!  Details about mine later.

						   Sooo busy tonight at work.  My feet are killing me.  Last Thursday at work, someone I knew came into the store.  We were the same year at college and went to the same church and therefore hung out together at group events.  And I knew she lived in Chino Hills, too.  And now it turns out that she's working at the Borders in the same strip mall.  Weird.  Why?  Well, I haven't seen her in years (literally) and I haven't been to any of the get-togethers of late.  It's not that I don't like her or my former church classmates.  I guess it came down to, once we weren't in the same school, church, city, etc, it became too hard to maintain ties that were pretty thin to begin with.  I don't mind.  I mean, we should be so lucky to maintain all our friendships that we have ever made.  But I do have to say, it was good to see her (even though we could only chat for a few seconds cuz I was suppose to be working) just because it reminded me that my life in Berkeley did exist, that it wasn't just a dream, and my life didn't always involve hours of driving and making coffee.  We had a ton of leftover pastries tonight.  We ran out of bags, so I took 'em home in a garbage bag.  It looked like I was the pastry Santa.  I should stop eating these things.  But... mmmm... peppermint brownie....  My schedule for this week:  Sun -- church, 7 to 11:45 pm Mon -- free day, hanging out with Robert Tue -- 7:15 to 11:15 am Wed -- free day, Christmas Eve! Thu -- day w/ family, Merry Christmas! Fri -- 4:15 to 8:45 am Sat -- 4:15 to 9 am Sun -- church, 6 to 10:15 pm  The next week, I'll be working every day, even though two of those days will be baby-sitting for my cousins.  Well, I could use the money.

						   So I saw the midnight showing of Return of the King last night.  My reaction to the movie?  Two words.   HOT DIGGITY!!!   I mean, there's a problem with highly-anticipated movies in that they rarely live up to the build-up (case in point,  The Phantom Menace ).  But not only did this movie live up to the hype, it surpassed it.  My only complaint?  It wasn't long enough.  (Yeah, cuz 3 hrs 20 mins is just the blink of an eye.)  I won't go into details here cuz I would like my faithful readers (hahahahahaha! I'm funny) to have a chance to see the movie before I go all fan girl on it.  But if anyone wants to call or e-mail me, we can drool together.  Droooooooool.  Okay, Legolas is hot (and Orlando Bloom is not, as I've said before), but I gotta say, Aragorn really stepped up in this movie.  Whoo-whee.  I can see why he makes the thirty-something women swoon.  On other news, I turned in my final project for my last class on Tuesday at 4:45 pm.  Actually, it wasn't completed.  Basically, it's part of a scene from a Neil Simon play that we had to storyboard, and for animation storyboards, they have to have a panel for every five words, about, cuz you  have to provide the acting yourself.  Anyway, for anyone of you that's seen or read a Neil Simon play, you know how wordy this guy is.  So thirty-one pages later, I get through a little over two pages.  Out of five.  If I had the time and paper to do the entire thing, it would have been about 70 pages long.  Daaaaaaang!  Anyway, so I finally take off from school at 5 pm (took a little time to check e-mail), and of course, driving from Santa Monica to Chino at the height of rush hour, piece of cake, right?  I normally drive around 70-80 mph back and forth, so it takes me a little less than an hour.  But with stop-and-go traffic, it took me 2 hrs and 20 mins.  Ugh.  It was grueling.  I had thought about signing up for some morning classes next semester.  After this, I think not.  How can people do this five days a week?  Anyway, I haven't posted my schedule this week, but suffice it to say, I've got late shifts for the rest of the week, except Friday when I get off a little earlier.  But I'm glad for the work.  After all, it's the season for spending.  And this Jesus-guy that I keep hearing about at church.  :P  My winter holiday projects: watch DVDS, watch DivX movies, read books on my list, work on ideas for animation projects, and hopefully do all these things with friends (though the reading may be hard to do so).  Happy Holidays!

						   Okay, I deleted that last post because I realize that I was being a bit harsh.  I mean, my dad is a great man and he's done a lot and sacrificed a lot for our family.  Sure he frustrates me in many ways, but what dad doesn't?  My biggest frustration was that he just didn't see that the book he was reading had a lot of faulty reasoning.  And yeah, it's true that I'm very cynical about these "new sciences" and that might prevent me from accepting new ideas.  But having seen enough infomercials with quack science, I was frustrated that my dad didn't also see it.  Anyway, yeah, my dad has his own brand of quack science, stuff either he thought up on his own or read from quack doctors.  (Remember the dad in  My Big Fat Greek Wedding  and how he could come up with the Greek derivation of every word?  Yeah... like that.)  Okay, enough about that.  Project due in 11 hrs.

						    urlLink I promised now, didn't I?   It's just one of the Flash projects I did this semester.  If anybody remember my old website, this is like the old mouse game only slightly more sophisticated.  Slightly.  As much as I would like the money, I think I might have to ignore the phone tomorrow (er... today) should the store call.  There's a reason why have it set to a different ringtone. :)  Comments, please!  BTW, I guess the Red Cross is getting desperate again cuz they actually called me to schedule a blood donation.  I set something up for Monday after this coming Monday, so I'll have a full report afterwards.  No school, so I should have more access to fluids.  Which leads me...  PLEASE DONATE BLOOD!  I don't know why I'm so impassioned about this considering that I don't know anybody personally that needed a transfusion.  I think it's because it's such a raw act of giving a physical part of yourself to someone in need.  Since I'm A+ I asked if they ever threw away my blood type leftovers since it's not as useful as O.  They replied that they never have leftovers of any blood type.  They always run out of every type.  Kinda humbled me so whenever they had a blood drive at school, I tried to stop by.  They had one a couple of weeks ago at my current school, but I was just getting over a cold (or the flu?) so I couldn't.  On a similar note,  urlLink American Bone Marrow Donor Registry .  I remember in elementary school, a teacher's daughter had leukemia and she died before they could find a donor.  I remember the school holding fundraisers and such in her name.  If you're of Asian decent, they especially want you!  Well, actually, if you're of any ancestry other than European, they really want you.  One of the things I did when I moved back home was to update my info with them.  The chances of finding a match is slim, but the newsletter was full of stories of those stranger-matches.  I mean, what could it hurt (other than the needle prick, I guess) and you might end up literally saving someone's life.  That's pretty cool.  I mean, I want to be an artist in the entertainment industry.  That has nothing to do with life and death.  This is one way of giving back.

						   Okay, something's wrong with the comments link so that the counter does not work.  But please keep commenting!  I went to  urlLink DV Expo West  today.  It was an interesting experience.  There certainly is a lot of software as well as hardward for DV.  Lots of spiffy things.  The most spiffy was this cloth that reflected back green slight at all angles, so that anything draped with that could be green-screened out fairly easily.  That was really neat.  I sat through a demo of Avid Xpress, and for those of y'all that don't know, Avid is the computer program most used to edit films.  It's a really high end, expensive program, stuff you can't really do on your desktop.  Avid Xpress is for the average souped-up desktop.  Oh boy, the program looked awesome.  Geek talk.  Sorry.  I'm soooo tired... yet again.  Having woken up at 5:30 this morning is finally hitting me.  Perhaps I need to get some caffeine.  I can't stand vending machine coffee now, though.  Well, not that bad, but basically it don't taste right.  Two projects, one final to go....

						   I've turned out two opportunities to pick up extra hours last week.  Yet, I feel pretty good about it.  Due to my misplacing the  Babalu Music of I Love Lucy  soundtrack, I have changed the music for my video project.  It will be from  O Brother, Where Art Thou?  soundtrack, and I'm deciding between "Big Rock Candy Mountain," "Down to the River," and "I'll Fly Away."  Humor-wise "Big Rock" is the best but quality-wise it's the worst, "Fly" has a better beat (and a pain to crop!) but "Down" has a pretty quality to it.  I guess the thing is that I do humor better than somber (mainly cuz my somber tends to turn corny) so I guess I'm afraid to do "Down."  That and I'm not sure if the final product will be as good as a more humorous piece.  And yes, I'm done babbling about stuff you don't care about.  Hey, I forgot to mention that I won a free Alias shirt last week.  No, not the TV show.  It's the company that makes Maya, the premiere 3D program.  And to be fair, they were here first.  Okay, gotta go.

						   Wow, it's been awhile (for me at least) so I'll try to be as brief as possible:  I went to an Alias User's Group Meeting (basically 3D geeks) and listened to a presentation by a small studio as well as from Sony Imageworks and their spiel on  The Haunted Mansion .  Visually, it seems a spectacular movie.  Main thing I learned, though, is not that there aren't enough jobs out there (though I think the large studios are going through a lot of down-sizing also), but that that there is more work than jobs out there.  Basically, the typical work week of a 3D artist in the middle of a project is 10 to 12 hours a day 6 days a week, and right before a deadline, it's not uncommon for 48-hr work days.  Which of course is making me wonder how the heck you fit 48 hrs in a 24-hr day.  Anyway, so it's making me wonder.  I love this stuff, but do I love it enough?  I mean, while I was watching the Primetime special this past Thursday where they went on the set of pick-up shots for  Return of the King , I was just going nuts (as you do when you're watching TV by yourself... it's lame, but y'know how some teenage girls go nuts when they see their fave boy band on the TV?  I get that way about behind-the-scenes stuff of my favorite movies.) and wishing I could have been a part of it.  I mean, it's gotta be passion (or ignorance) to want to be a part of it that much, right?  Anyway, so it was a bit of soul-searching to figure out if I'm willing to take the bad with the good.  I asked one of my teachers who used to work at Sony Imageworks (the one who told me about the work schedule) how anybody has a life or sees their family.  He looked at me and said, "They don't."  Maybe my joking about how I'll never get married will come true.  I'll post my schedule tomorrow.  I gotta be working on my project anyway.  For the soundtrack, I'm thinking "We'll Build a Bungalow" though I'm not sure what to do about images.  Should I get Lucy, Ricky, Fred, and Ethel, or do something completely different?  I told the assistant manager not to call me in for work today if it gets busy (like they normally do) just cuz I'm so tired.  It worked.  Lots of sleep.  Though my recent paycheck showed the difference.  But I worked enough in the past three months to qualify for stock investment options.  Perhaps I'll get something for insurance sometime soon too.  Though I wonder if it would be worth it to pay for medical insurance considering how little I used it when I did have it.  'course, I'm not as young and strong as I used to be.  I'm even debating about whether dental would be worth it.  I'll have to see.  I mean, it's not like they've even offered it already.

						   I gotta say, as illnesses go, this one seems be easier than others.  'course, I did get a lot of sleep, but so far I only had to take medication to do stuff on only the first day.  I even worked tonight without the need for drugs.  Though... drugs are good.  Just say yes. :)  I worked with Stickler-Lead again.  She apologized for being off tonight due to an oncoming sickness.  Well... my shift had never been easier.  She has also started taking leftover pastries home now, so I got a nice batch tonight.  Lots of muffins.  My mom will be happy.  Is it wrong to wish Stickler-Lead was sick more often?   The Italian Job .  It's a pretty good movie.  No need to stretch for Mark Wahlberg, which is a good thing.  Seth Green was hilarious.  I like Seth Green.  I caught  Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me  on TV, and I forgot how funny he was during his short scenes.  Anybody want to join me for midnight showing of Return of the King on Dec 17th?  (Well, technically night of Dec 16th to Dec 17th.)

						   To satisfy someone's  whinings ... I hung out with Robert and Amber this week.   A lot.   I was seen in public with them.  I shared meals with them.  I even got yelled at by my mom for hanging out too much with them.  So there.  This past Sunday, we went to Magic Mountain.  It was pretty fun.  There were hardly any lines.  The longest I had to wait was like ten minutes for X and Goliath at the end of the day.  And yes, I said "I" because I rode those by myself.  But we went on a lot of rides, and we went on every roller coaster that was operational that day, except one which sucked and I forgot the name of.  But there was nothing else at the park, so we didn't get to watch any shows or whatnot.  We did, however, get dressed up and took photos.  Well, they took photos, I took a photo.  They were dressed as an Old West gunslinger and "woman-of-ill-repute," and with me, we were a Victorian trio of I-don't-know-what.  It could've been a Victorian couple with their Asian governess, or else an "unconventional relationship"-in-a-repressed-society.  One of these days, I'll scan the pictures and put them on my website.  I was going to whine and sulk about my life, but I don't think that's interesting so I won't.  Instead, I'll whine about the legal troubles we are in.  My parents have been making angry racist remarks, and well... though I don't like it, I don't blame them.  My mom barely hit the guy and it wasn't even on his side and he drove off afterwards perfectly fine.  Yet... he had to go and hire Larry H. Parker and claim that he's at death's door.  Such crap.  So tired.  This past couple of weeks have been rather busy mainly due to hanging out with Robert and Amber (Ambert!), then visiting Erica, church stuff, and more hours at work.  My store manager asked me to design something for their leadership conference, and the final image is due on Friday and I haven't even given her preliminary sketches.  Meanwhile, I would still like to see  Return of the King  once again in the theaters and revamp my website.  I'm kinda like my dad.  I can't say no to social stuff.  Well, I can, but if I really want to do it, then I can't.  Sigh.  In the past four days, I've had 7-11 coffee twice.  (It was late, I needed the caffeine.)  And I gotta say... it wasn't too bad.  They've got a big selection of flavored creamers and syrups, and they're free!  Not 30&#162; extra like at Starbucks.  I'm sure there's a difference in the beans and brewing method, but I'm not much of a conoisseur, so I couldn't really tell.  It's too late to post my schedule for this week, but I have to work closing during the weekend, tomorrow I work opening, and Friday I have off and we'll see what I end up doing that day.

						   I'm am getting that bloodlust again.  I played Legolas in the XBox version of LotR:Return of the King, and it's a spiffy game.  They've managed to blend scenes from the movie flawlessly into the game interface.  Phooey, though, that my dying actually affects the game.  Phooey.  Update on F and T from work: F is no longer working at our store, but that's not stopping her from calling T up all the time.  T kept on telling F to stop calling him.  But she won't.  Her parents' solution?  Put out a restraining order against T.  Fuh-nee.  Poor T.  Apparently, he had nothing to do with F's  urlLink little incident  but everyone thinks he did.  Okay, final thought for the day:  I'm on the mailing list for the LucasArts newsletter, even though I'm not much of a gamer.  Mainly to see what kind of job openings they've got.  It seems they always have art jobs open.  Anyway, this week there's an opening for a Production Assistant.  Basically, the Producter's gofer.  It seems like a good way to get a foot in the game industry.  Now, competition will be stiff and my chances of getting this job, should I apply, would probably be in the low single-digit percentage.  But the thing is that this job is in San Rafael (Marin County).  So if they should ask me if I'm willing to relocate to that area, the question is, am I?  I'm not sure.  I mean,  it's a fabulous company (and I know, I know, I have a one in a gazillion chance of actually getting the job) and no doubt great experience, but the industry's in LA, some of the better schools (or instructional facilities) are in LA, and not to mention, it's really expensive to live out there.  A part of me says to just go for it and worry about it if I actually get the job.  But those of you that know me that I'm the type to worry five steps ahead, so I will.  Can't help it.  Phooey.

						    Happy Birthday Robert!   Schedule this week:  Mon: too damn early Tue: no work, hanging out with Robert Wed: 6:45 to 10:45 pm Thu: 6:45 to 10:45 pm Fri: no work Sat: 4:15 am to 12:15 pm Sun: church  I had a good day at work today.  I guess it's all about who you work with.  I took a pilates class at the gym.  That was kinda fun.  I mainly wanted to see what it was about.  Well, turns out, it's mostly ab work.  There's a bit of upper and lower body, but it always involves the abs.  Too bad I can't commit to the class.  It could totally shrink my gut.  I had dinner with a longtime friend on Sunday.  Those of you in the know who I'm talking about.  It's hard to describe my feelings towards it, and I don't want to publish them here cuz I want to respect the privacy of the other parties involved.  But in the end, thing can only get better.  Maybe not ideal, but better.  School is less than a month away.  Considering that most other schools have already started, I'm kinda lucky.  Though that means that my summer break is shorter.  But this is good.  I keep on meaning to start some art projects.  I've been so tired lately.  The hypochondriac in me thinks chronic fatique syndrome, but I'm not  that  tired.  I should still try to uphold my new-school-year resolution of getting more sleep.  Or more like, getting more regular sleep.  Right now, I think I should aim low and keep my rest-of-winter-break goals as 1) watch LotR:RotK again in the theaters, 2) watch LotR:TTT DVD with the various commentaries and the extra features, 3) watch various movies in my pile, 4) fulfill my duties as member of my church's website team, and if I can, 5) update my website in the process.  I should try to cut my TV-watching, but how can I stop now that  American Idol  has started?  I won't be able to watch the Tuesday night shows once school starts, so it'll probably be like last year where I won't watch until the very end.  Hey, it was enough to get me to buy the Clay Aiken CD.  Not so much the Reuben Studdard CD.  And the latest Josh Groban CD... isn't as good as the first.  Dang it.  I'm such a fangirl.

						   My legs are sore from leg bends two days ago.  Tonight I just did some cycling and upper body stuff.  I feel pretty good.  But I've only got one more week 'til the free membership runs out and I better steel myself for the heavy sales pitch.  But I've got one that's fool-proof: "I can't afford it."  I mean, how can they argue with that?  Yeah, I know I kinda sounded interested when I signed on, but if I counter with, "I just figured out my budget and I can't afford it," how can they challenge me on that?  That happened when I went to the free trainer appointment and afterwards they tried to sell me the service and I just answered, "Sorry I'm not interested."  And they asked, "Why not?" and I replied, "Because of the money" and they replied, "Well, we can break down the monthly payment of $320 into four weekly payments of $80 and would that help?" and I replied, "No, it doesn't."  They said okay and that was it.  Okay, on that point, how can that help?  It's still the same amount of money in the end.  They're targeting people that take their paycheck and spend spend spend until they run out, I guess.  So I realize that though LA Fitness looks great from the outside, it's still flawed in many ways.  For one, some of the machines have worn or torn seat pads, and some of the machines don't have pins for the weights.  And I'm guessing that since the days of 24-Hour Fitness during high school, a lot of gyms nowadays have indoor heated pools, yoga classes, and raquetball courts.  Though I did compare the prices, and while they are on the high end, their prices are comprable to 24-Hour Fitness and other gyms.  Well, as I have plunked down yet more money to fix yet another problem on my aging car, the only gym I can afford is the treadmill-and-soup-can-weights plan at home.  Hey, you'd be surprised how much you can do with just those.  Now if only I can force myself to get off my duff to actually use them.  BTW, thanks for the comments!  It seems the only way I get them is if I specifically ask a question.  Anybody wanna know about how the  urlLink LA SIGGRAPH  meeting went?

						   Schedule for next week:  Mon -- 4:00 to 10:15 pm Tue -- 8:45 am to 1:00 pm, LA SIGGRAPH meeting Wed -- 4:15 am to 9:00 am Thu -- no work Fri -- 12:45 to 5:15 pm Sat -- no work Sun -- 10:00 am church  Two things today:  So the LA Fitness by my house has this deal where you can get a one-week pass for free.  However, you can get a two-week pass instead if you pay a reserve rate, which is a percentage of the membership due, and at the end of two weeks, if you want to join, you just pay off the balance or else you can get a refund.  To start off, LA Fitness is a niiiiiiice gym.  They've got a heated pool among other things.  However, they are just waaaaaay too expensive.  But... well, in order to get the two weeks, I did the second option.  My question: was that stupid of me?  I have every intention of not joining this gym, but I wanted an extra week's worth of access to that pool and the yoga and pilates classes, etc.  I just hope I'm not getting myself into trouble.  Second thing, this involves what happened at work:  So this afternoon, I got woken up by my cell (yeah yeah, I was asleep in the afternoon) and it was "T", a lead at my store, and I guess you could call him the VIP of leads since he was the store manager's right-hand man since the beginning until recently when we got an assistant manager.  Anyway, this is the guy who's only 19 or 20.  Anyway, he asked me if I wanted to take over someone's shift tonight, not mentioning anyone in particular.  So I say yes.  Cut to the end of the shift tonight.  We were almost done when this older couple bursts in the door.  They are the parents of "F," who's shift I took over tonight.  They came to pick up F from her shift.  We informed them that she didn't work tonight.  The dad just goes ballistic.  Y'see, F is only 16, and still a minor.  The dad yells, "How can you lose track of a 16-yr-old?"  See, he was blaming us for not taking responsibility over her.  Y'see what happened, right?  F pulled a fast one over her parents.  Apparently, the mom dropped her off at the store at the beginning of her "shift" so it seems she lied about not working.  But I guess F isn't smart enough to realize that if she wanted to keep up the ruse she ought to have come back before her shift "ended" or else called her parents up and told them that she left early and got a ride with someone, etc.  Anyway, after I told my co-workers that it was T that had called me and that I had no idea I was taking over F's shift, they all cracked up.  Apparently, F has a thing for T, and she's absolutely ineffective at work when T's present.  I could almost say vice versa, too.  We were talking about how T should be careful since in California, if they should do the horizontal mambo it's considered statutory rape.  Anyway, it was an upbeat ending to our shift.  I mean, it will suck for F and possibly even T, but for us witnesses, it was just hilarious.  I just hope I don't get caught up in the middle of any trouble.  We were joking about how we'll know what happened if F is allowed to show up for work the next time.  We did wonder something, though.  I mean, since F is a minor, who is responsible for her?  I mean, since she didn't even set foot in the store, is Starbucks responsible for her whereabouts?  Technically she was scheduled to work, but she never clocked in.  This is probably one of the reasons why people don't like hiring minors.  I don't know the specifics of work permits, though I worked when I was 17.  I'm trying to think what I did then, but I don't remember getting anything 'cept a physical.

						   Wow, it's been a few days since I've even checked e-mail.  It's always a nice thing to finally have things to read (e-mail and other people's blogs).  Hey, does anybody even care if I post my schedule or not?  Right now I just use it as my reference whenever I want to recall my work schedule outside of my house, but I meant it so that people who want to contact me would know when I was home, or else if they've got a similar schedule and wanted to hang out, and such.  Eh, whatever.  Things are less hectic at the store now.  Good cuz it's not neverending madness.  Bad cuz then there's less hours and tips.  We got a tip today that the health inspector was coming today.  He didn't while I was there, but boy, never has the place looked cleaner!  I've been sleeping erratically, lately.  Yeah, what else is new, right?  But it's weird cuz now I can't go to sleep before 4 am nowadays, so of course I wake up tired and groggy, so I have to take a nap in the afternoon which means that I'm not tired enough to go to bed before 4 am....  So last Monday night, I actually fell asleep early... only to wake up in the afternoon!  The total hours ran in the double digits.  Right now I'm forcing myself to stay awake even after only three hours sleep last night....  Meanwhile, I will be actually working on my website!  I corrected a few problems on my Flash homework assignments from this past quarter so I'll be putting that up sometime soon.  Yeah, I know, empty promises.  Later dudes.

						   In the Year of our Lord, Two-thousand four.  Ooh.  I saw  The Hours  today.  It's... a challenging movie.  The acting is superb, I gotta say, but I don't quite get the story.  The other ppl who saw it with me were saying it's about lesbianism in repressed societies, but I don't think so.  I mean, if it is, then they did a poor job of it.  I was saying it was more about being trapped by despair and hopelessness.  I think they just got caught up with the whole woman-kissing-woman thing and didn't see the broader aspect of it.  Or maybe not.  Maybe they really are lesbians.  Anyway, the movie was pretty good and I could understand the emotional tone of it just from personal experience.  I mean, I never wanted to kill myself, but there have been a few times where I felt so blue that I wished life ceased to exist.  Ah well....

						   Boo-Yah!  Take that, you sneaky little spyware!  It took me two weeks, almost to the exact hour, but I finally bested your Spaniard!  Apparently, two weeks ago, while I was... perusing for files of a "downloadable" nature, I managed to download and install some sort of spyware.  It caused my cpu usage to shoot to 100% whenever I tried to open any windows.  Anyway, I looked up online (using another computer, of course) to figure out what was wrong, and basically, I found out it was either spyware or adware and downloaded a couple of programs to get rid of it.  Well, they got rid of a bunch of stuff that I didn't even know was on my computer, but my cpu problem still lingered.  So I looked more online and found out that these programs don't get rid of all the spyware on my computer.  So I physically looked and found some suspicious executables.  So I deleted those and still the problem existed.  Then I found out that certain .dll files can cause this problem.  So I looked through all the .dll files on my computer, found a few suspicious ones in my windows directory, and proceeded to rename them one by one til I found the culprit.  That totally worked!  Anyway, I ended up deleting related files (files that were installed at the same time, or were from the same company... damn you roing.com!), but mainly it was this one .dll file that once I renamed, solved everything.  So this is the first time in two weeks that I've been able to do anything on my computer.  Gotta be careful from now on.  So yeah, the entries from the past two weeks have been from school.  Anyway, I can now finally catch up on all the stuff that I wasn't able to do.  One of the things that I've been meaning to do is send an e-mail to a couple of co-workers who are not more than 2 or 3 years younger than me, and sending them a link to a video of the commercial from the late 80's of the Britannica Boy.   OKAY , y'all remember the Britannica Boy, right?  "I've always wondered where my mandibula was...."   Remember ???  I remember in 5th grade of this one kid who got new glasses and complained that he looked like the Britannica Boy!  I can understand maybe the 20-yr-old not remembering, but c'mon!

						   I'm a coward.  Yeah, you all know that.  But in this industry, networking is everything, and I've been a nasty little cowardses.  Well, basically, I'm starting to recognize a lot of people in my classes since I've had classes with them before.  There isn't a formal track program here, but there's enough of a progression of classes that you end up with similar schedules every semester.  Anyway, there are a few people that I've met through other people, and I'm somewhat of a coward when it comes to facing these people by myself.  Erg.  I'm only thankful that those people looked past my cowardice and approached me.  That's one thing that I will definitely have to work on.  Meet new people, and say hi to those I have met before.  The main problem is that I have a really hard time remembering names, but people are usually very forgiving of that.  But blatant ignoring them... well, that's another matter.  I'd hate for that to bite me in the butt later.  I've already got one lead, though, through a friend at church.  She's got a friend in the industry.  Sweet.  Yesterday I ate up a lot of gasoline to come to a class I'm going to drop and to watch a really expensive movie ($9.50!) and drive around aimlessly for more than half an hour total trying to find parking in this frustrating city.  Santa Monica reminds me so much of Berkeley.  Both good and bad.  Well, without the homeless and tall buildings, and with offices for pretty famous studios.  Gettin' kicked out.  G'nite.

						   Thanks for all your wishes.  I really appreciate them. :)  I'm gonna post my schedule for this week soon, but suffice it to know that I have school Tuesday and Thursday, though I had school today too to try to waive out of a class... bleh.  My classes this semester will be:  3D Animation I Digital Audio Design Beginning Illustrator 2D Animation II  I may have bitten off more than I can chew due to the two animation classes, but we'll see.  It's only 13 units, too!  Reminds me how Cal art classes were only 3 units.  But I'm not complaining here cuz less units mean less tuition fees.  Updates on my thoughts on the semester ahead later.  Yeah, I know, I always say later and never come through.  Such am I.

						   So I am officially a certified Starbucks barista.    "Wow, what does that mean?"  "Well, my young friend, that means that in the world of Starbucks, I now have proof that I know and can make all the drinks that the Starbucks Coffee Company offers."  "Wow, you must be a smarty-pants!"  "Why, yes, yes I am."  As y'all seem to gather from my previous posts, I like to watch PBS a lot.  I should probably send them a donation one of these days.  I can't wait for the  Colonial House  series coming this May.  Anyway, one of the recent PBS programs that I watched is  urlLink Hot Dog Program , about our culture's love of hot dogs and the various famous hot dog places in the country.  Watching it made me rather hungry.  It's an old documentary, made in 1999, and I remember watching it around then and it made me crave a hot dog.  So the next day, I made a stopover at Top Dog.  Mmmm... Top Dog.  Well, when it aired recently, there's no local hot dog place here.  Well, none that are good, anyway.  But the program did feature  urlLink Pink's Hot Dog Stand .  So last night, when I went to the LA SIGGRAPH meeting with my friend Dave, afterwards we stopped off at Pink's.  I gotta say, they're famous for their chili dogs, and it was a damn good chili dog.  I am such a Homer Simpson.  A few days ago, I had a craving for a donut on my way back from Robert's, but the good place was closed and there was too much traffic to back track to get to the other places and by the time I got on the freeway, I had no idea where there were any good donut places.  Just as well, I guess, since I shouldn't be eating donuts anyway.  So this was one of my passing thoughts, then.  Should I ever become pregnant in the future, I wonder what I would crave?  Maybe I would crave healthy salads and vegemeat.  It's kinda funny.  As much as I like fruits and veggies, I don't ever crave them.  I crave meat (lots-o-meat), salty chips, chocolate, and sometimes salsa.  I used to snack on pickles at night, but I haven't craved those in a long time.  So much for the theory that we crave what our bodies need, right?  Last I checked, I didn't have a fat/salt/sugar deficiency.  BTW, since I keep forgetting, my schedule for the next 1.5 weeks:  Fri -- 7 pm to 12:15 am Sat -- 8:15 pm to 12:15 am Sun -- church, 6:45 to 10:45 pm Mon -- Fun w/ Erica (et al) Day! Tue -- First day of school for the semester... and what else? Wed -- 10:45 am to 3:30 pm Thu -- school Fri -- 7:45 am to 2:30 pm Sat -- 7:15 am to 12:15 pm, then church thing? Sun -- church, 6 to 10 pm

						   Hey, so why aren't my regulars commenting?  Eh?  Eh?  (Nevermind, you kettle me pot.)  Wow, it's been almost a week since I've posted!  You must think I've died or something!  Well, close.  I've just been sick the past few days, and I'm buying into the theory that our bodies have their own response to fight diseases, and by taking medicine we are only hindering our bodies from their thang.  So far, though, it's just been sore throat, sporadic coughing, and a lot of runny nose, so I'm not sure how much more I've got to wait this thing out.  After all, my flu shot can only last for so long.  School's starting next week.  Right on my birthday, too.  Oh well, there are worse ways to celebrate.  I'm reminded of my 21st where I spent it with a couple of sick roommates, one of whom was so sick that her parents and her then-9-yr-old sister came up to visit.  Oooh yeah.  Nothin' like turnin' legal to party with a elementary-schooler. ;P  Turning 25, though, is making me go through a quarter-life crisis.  What the heck am I doing?  I'm seeing my peers getting married, establishing careers (or at least is on a solid plan) and I'm feeling like a giant loser kid with no prospects.  I guess I'm just getting antsy.  I've done a lot of slacking and having fun this winter break, but that's getting me no closer to my career goals.  It's a long story, but I saw this  urlLink program  on PBS, and it was nothing new, but it did remind me that the mass immigration of Koreans in the 70's and 80's had only  one major  purpose, and that's the education (and subsequent success) of their children.  And well... it's a scary burden to know that your parents sacrificed everything to live in a foreign culture so that you could become a success.  Anyway, I've already taken to calling myself a 25-yr-old, so once the day comes, I suppose it won't be too much of a shock.  Urgh.  ******SHOCK*******

						   I saw  La Boheme  (the opera directed by Baz Luhrman) on Tuesday.  It was pretty good.  But I feel like I missed a lot cuz I was too busy reading the subtitles.  After awhile, I just had to ignore the subtitles and just focus on the emotions and the music and the visuals.  I think for that reason I like  Rent  better.  Weird, cuz I don't mind subtitles in films.  But it was cool seeing an opera, cuz the singing was so much more... overwhelming.  It's so much... bigger... than pop-singing styles.  Oh, and to be clear, I saw it with Erica.  Hey, I hang out with other people besides Robert and Amber.  Like last Friday, I hung out with Andrea (who was my best-friend growing up and is Robert's ex) and her sister Chuck (who's real name is Kristen and is a fellow Starbucks barista) and it was an interesting day that I'd rather not go into on a public blog.  But what was surprising was that I must have dropped my temporary 24-Hr Fitness pass somewhere in Downtown Disney (where we were hanging out) and the Disney Lost-n-Found mailed it to me.  I guess they're pretty good about that.  BTW, I got caught ( again ) in a Snapshot (the mystery shopper for Starbucks).  I absolutely hate those things.  We got good on everything except the waiting time.   Again .  Argh!!!  It took thirteen minutes for the person to get their drinks, and the max time is five (and perfect is under three).  I know why it took so long.  Cuz our espresso grinder is funky and the shots have been pulling in 30-40 seconds (it should be between 18-23, and we've been using 14-29).  And it takes awhile to make a drink cuz we keeping having to throw out bad shots.  Well, it's come down to quality vs. speed, and I say that quality matters more.  I mean, there's a reason why fast food tastes like fast food.  As if I need more ammunition should they decide to fire me.  Sigh.  Well, at least I should qualify for medical insurance this month.  I think I'm in dire need of either a dermatologist or an allergist.

						   I should stop drinking caffeine so late.  I had a raspberry mocha at my first ten minute break tonight, and that was enough to wire me for the rest of the shift.  But I got a black tea lemonade to take home with me, and even though it's diluted, it still has caffeine.  But then, maybe it's that I slept for 12+ hours last night and woke up only two and a half hours before my shift started.  I saw  Big Fish  on Friday.  How Catholic.  Heh heh.  It's a good movie.  Not as good as  Return of the King , (here that, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences?) but pretty good.  Ewan MacGregor was excellent (as always) and his stories are so quirky.  And the Siamese twins are really Siamese twins.  Well, maybe Japanese.  The movie has the traditional Tim Burton dark humor, which is awesome.  And Edward Bloom fights the North Koreans in the war, and they actually spoke Korean.  Hey, speaking of which, in the episode of  Alias  where Sydney and Vaughn end up in North Korea, the Korean they were speaking was weird.  I mean, I know that North Korea speaks with a different satoori (accent & colloquialism) but it just sounded angry and unclear.  Eh.  I worked at a different store Friday morning, and they had an automatic espresso machine.  It felt weird just pushing a button to pull shots.  I'm so used to getting beans from the grinder, tamping the filters, and pulling the shots and hoping it falls within the correct time frame.  Well, it turns out that this machine pulls rather crappy shots.  Makes sense why we still have our manual machine.  It was also weird just dealing with people I've never worked with.  I wonder what it would be like to work with someone from another store whom I've never met.  So after that shift from 4 am to 8:15 am (how crazy is that?), I worked on a design for a stamp for a coffee blend contest they're having for the Starbucks leadership conference.  I have a image scanned on my dad's computer, so I'll put it up eventually.  (Yeah, right.)  But I was thinking that it didn't really fit with the contest guidelines, and I doubt it could be used as a coffee stamp image.  For one, it's too cartoony.  I think I could've used a nap yesterday.  And now it's almost 4 am, and I'm not tired and I've got church in six hours.  Ech.  In case I don't get a chance to publish this tomorrow, my schedule for next week is:  Mon -- 7:15 to 11:15 am Tue -- no work Wed -- 6:45 to 10:45 pm Thu -- 4:15 to 9:15 pm Fri -- no work but volunteering between 10 am to 4 pm Sat -- 8 pm to 12:15 am Sun -- church at 10 am, 5:30 to 9:45 pm

						   All y'all suck.  Nobody responded to my question.  :*-(  (Sure, it's buried in a friggin' essay, but still...)  So here's the question again:  Do you think I should keep doing what I'm doing (work part-time at Starbucks and go to school full-time) so I can develop a reel and look for jobs a year or so from now but for now be stuck in the boondocks, or should I instead get a full-time job in West LA area and move out there and attend school part-time so that I can be closer to the industry and thus have a better chance at internships and/or entry-level non-artistic jobs at industry companies (i.e. a receptionist)?  There was an interesting article in the Sunday LA Times about self-defeating attitudes.  I think I've some of that.  That, and it is a risk, financially among others, and I've been somewhat of a chicken when it comes to life lately.  Erg.  That arrogant badass that had no qualms (well, more like I was just stupidly ignorant about the dangers) at yelling at carnies... well, that girl is gone.  Or at least in hibernation.  Gettin' kicked out.  Please, feedback, y'all!

						   I've told this to a gazillion people, but if you're the gazillion-and-oneth person who hasn't heard this, this is a bumper sticker that I saw once:  Friends help you move. Best friends help you move bodies.  Heh heh.  Today I did the former for a couple of church friends.  Well, church friends that are a couple.  It was kinda tough since my sleep pattern's been wacked and I was a bit tired, but I had a drink during my shift this morning (quadruple grande hazelnut latte) and took home a drink afterwards (triple venti raspberry white mocha) so in all I had a total of seven shots of espresso.  One of the other guys helping with the move (who's a pharmacy-grad-student) said that that's not very healthy since too much caffeine at once can cause heart reactions.  He's probably right.  I don't think I'm addicted, but I did start out my shift really tired and a bit headachy, but after the first drink I felt normal.  I'm guessing that's not good.  But I don't normally need caffeine to get through the day, though lately I've had caffeine almost every day.  The only reason why I don't have it every day is that I haven't been working every day (that I'm not in school, that is, since at school I tend to drink soda).  Hmm... perhaps I am addicted and just in denial?  There are a few of you that I've been whining to lately about my career-direction (or lack thereof) and how I'm itchin' to get out of Chino.  Especially with the recent store drama, I realize that no matter what BS I said, I don't want to stay with Starbucks, even beyond the two to three years I mentioned at the beginning.  I seem to go through these ideas in spurts cuz a few months ago I was looking at job ads in the Santa Monica/West LA area and at rental listings to see how much they averaged.  I asked the Starbucks near my school how much their starting pay was, and it was the same as here.  At that rate, I couldn't even afford to share a room with someone else.  So could I get some feedback from you, my loyal readers?  Do you think I should keep doing what I'm doing (work part-time at Starbucks and go to school almost-full-time) so I can develop a reel and look for jobs a year or so from now but for now be stuck in the boondocks, or should I instead get a full-time job in West LA area and move out there and attend school part-time so that I can be closer to the industry and thus have a better chance at internships and/or entry-level non-artistic jobs at industry companies (i.e. a receptionist)?  Finally, my schedule for next week:  Mon -- 7:30 am to 12:30 pm Tue -- school Wed -- 4:15 to 8:30 pm Thu -- school Fri -- 6:00 am to 1:45 pm Sat -- family wedding in the afternoon Sun -- church, then 6:15 to 10:45 pm

						   I had typed something out last night, but then Robert called and I went out of the lab to talk and left my stuff in the computer lab, and then I didn't realize the lab was closing and I had to chase down the lab supervisor to get him to open it back up again for my stuff.  It sounds funny now.  Anyway, just to reiterate something you guys haven't heard in the first place, I had a great shift last Wednesday (hey, one week ago!) at that other store.  There was no drama, the people there were great, and a customer paid me the hugest compliment.  He told me, "If the world was filled with people like you, it would be a better place." Then he called over the assistant manager and told him to "hold onto her" and pointed at me.  Yeah, I got misty-eyed.  (Not good customer service my a--.)  The meeting with that certain personnel and that other certain personnel went well, though the outcome wasn't ideal.  It helped that the other lady was a better talker and didn't make me feel like a whiner.  She validated that I had a legitimate gripe even if it was a miscommunication.  Officially we're moving forward with greater communication.  Unofficially?  I have to watch my back and play the game.  So I can't quite think of a good reason to transfer to a store that's slightly farther away without pointing fingers.  On a funny note, though, we all got these little cards in our bins with info on "corporate compliance."  Heh heh.  For those of you that have prayed for me, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I really do.  It's hard to trust that God has it all under control, but it's comforting to me that no matter how hard things get, He has it all under control.  Okay, my schedule for the rest of the week is a school tomorrow and a shift Saturday morning.  I prefer working Saturday mornings to nights cuz for one thing, it's less busy, and plus I get to have Saturday nights free (to... loaf around?).  Hey, at least I can watch the World Figure Skating Competition Ladies Free Skate.  Oh, and Maya works now. :)

						   Too stressed.  I'm hungry but I can't eat.  I sent out a prayer request to the women's fellowship of my church at two in the morning last night.  Every single shift since has been pins and needles.  I got called to cover a shift at another store tomorrow.  Sad to say that it would be a relief to work with total strangers.  For those of you in the know, please pray for strength, courage, and wisdom in this matter.  For those of you not, please still pray for me.  Thanks.  Meanwhile, my ethernet card has gone kaput, which means I can't run Maya on my computer.  Until my brother can give me his spare, I might have to spend some extra time in Santa Monica.  Erg.  No schedule posted this week... for reasons relating to this drama.

						   Erg.  Eating bad.  Sleeping bad.  Drinking too much caffeine.  Spent $2.50 to print out one stinkin' page of clip-art quality art work, all because I forgot to print it out at home.  Erg.  In case I don't get a chance to write this later,  Happy Birthday Erica!   In my audio class, my teacher decided to add five more people, so basically, if you want a computer of your own during class, you have to come early.  His idea is that we'll be spending time outside of class mucking around with ProTools.  Like who has the time?!  I think I'll end up using SoundForge or something to work on my projects for that class cuz there ain't no way I can come to Santa Monica too often to muck around with their ProTools station.  For those of you that don't know, ProTools is a highly sophisticated audio editing program that requires a specific hardware to work.  Whudaheck?  Dang it, gotta go.  If I don't get to the animation lab early, then my seat gets taken and so do the good lightboxes (mainly, ones that work).

						   Finally, a confirmation that someone else remembers the Britannica Boy!  I had to work tonight so I missed most of the Oscars and my VCR messed up and didn't record it.  Dang it.  LoTR:RotK rules!  My schedule for this week:  Mon -- 10:30 am to 4:15 pm Tue -- school Wed -- 3:45 to 10:45 pm Thu -- school Fri -- 10:15 am to 5:00 pm Sat -- 4:15 to 10:15 am Sun -- church, 4:00 to 10:45 pm  This weekend my sister and bro-in-law are set to come.  My Mom's going nuts making kimchee for them and whatnot.  My Dad jokes that she goes all out for my sister and my brother but not for me.  Sad but true. :*I  (Not really.  It's more like her efforts towards me is spread out throughout the days.  After all, I'm pretty lazy.)  I'm already running behind on homework.  And sooo tired.  What else is new?  (BTW, to answer your question, I used  SpyBot Search & Destroy  and  Ad-Aware .  The spyware on my computer was on both their lists but still wasn't able to get rid of it.)

						   Some more updates on the drama that is my life:  This past Saturday I did something pretty darn stupid that ended up costing me big.  I met up with some church friends at the Brea Mall to carpool to another friend's house in Irvine to do some baking for gift baskets for the Church Inaugural Service the next day.  Well, we were in a hurry and I didn't notice that the parking spot I was in (it was in the covered parking structure) wasn't a real parking space but instead was a flow-way.  Hey, it was early, there were hardly any cars, all I saw were lines, and it was an honest mistake!  I mean, if I think about it, there was a point where something didn't seem right, but like I said, we were in a hurry.  Well... you guessed it folks, when I came back, the car wasn't there.  Courtesy of the Brea Towing Company.  Aarrrrrgghhhhh.  Luckily, I was able to get it back that same day, so I didn't have to pay overnight fees.  But this escapade set me back a hunner-fohty-dollahs.  Double-aarrrrrrggghhhhhhhh.  As I was sharing my fate with others, they laughed and told me their stories.  There's a reason why towing is big business out there.  But I do have to admit, this was completely due to my stupidity.  Y'see, as I was pulling in, a thought ran through my head-- why is there an arrow on this parking spot?  Yes, yes, yes.  Now shaddap.  The worst part?  Going home and having my mom tear me a new one.  Y'see, since my car's registered under my dad's name, I couldn't go get it by myself.  Sigh.  More later.

						   Hey, what's the late penalty for filing taxes?  I finally filed my taxes (through free e-file through H&R Block) but it didn't get "officially" filed with the IRS until today.  I mean, it's a tiny return.  What more can they take out of it?  My visit with the dermatologist went okay.  He was a bit condescending and I had to make sure he didn't just see me for five minutes.  I mean, I've heard the spiel before.  I made sure he understood that I tried a lot of things and he better be damn sure he's diagnosing  me  and not what statistically I'd be.  But I made an appointment to see him again in two weeks, and if I have to pay the deductible again, then that's just gonna  suck .  I've already spent $50 this week for doctor's visits (PCP and dermatologist), and next week I'm seeing my PCP again for a physical, and the week after that will be the dermatologist again.  Sigh.  What I liked about Korean doctors was that they would "cook the books" so that we wouldn't have to pay the deductible.  I mean, it's dishonest... but if I end up seeing this dermatologist every other week, then I'll be spending $50 a month on office visits alone.  On the job front, the comission is going so-so.  I haven't had much time to work on it, but then, right now it's just brainstorming ideas for names.  I think he basically wants to see which name can come up with the coolest logo.  Well, I can't work on it until after my shift tonight, anyway.  It's weird, I used to look forward to working.  In the beginning, at least.  Then it got to be so-so, but otherwise okay.  Now... well, it's weird, but the hours before I have to work, I just get this deep feeling of dread in my core.  Kinda like when I was working for that collectibles company.  You know that feeling when you just want to get out and  you're just watching the clock going through the motions 'til time's up?  Well, I was like that at that company.  At my store?  It's kinda like that, though we're much too busy to be able to watch the clock.  But right when I first get on shift, I just feel this sense of being trapped.  I guess being busy helps cuz right when I'm feeling the worst of it, that's when I get my break.  I think what makes it less like that other job is that the interaction with the customers makes it so much better.  I'm not just in my head the entire time.  I don't have time to wallow in my sucky life.  (Okay, I gotta go, but one last thing I want to rant about relating to my doctor visit.  He asked me what type of soap I was using.  I told him it was this one that I bought from a cosmetics company that's suppose to be hydrating cuz it's made of olive oil and it's okay for sensitive skin.  Well, he told me to stop using it.  So now I feel like going to that store and slamming that expensive soap on their counter and demanding a refund, albeit a year later.  It made me realize that we were  duped .  I wish I can sue them for false claims.  They reassured me that all that stuff we bought was okay for sensitive skin.  Stupid Koreans.  Stupid sales people.  That's why I never pressure anyone to buy more than they initially ask for at the store.)

						   Schedule this week: Tue -- no school!, meeting up w/ friends Wed -- 8:30 am to 4 pm, then hanging out w/ Robert Thu -- no school!, doc appt Fri -- 6:15 pm to 12:15 am Sat -- morning hike w/ sister's fellowship Sun -- church  I little more news on the job angst front.  A church friend commissioned me to design a logo (well, design a logo after coming up with a name) for his company.  In  two  weeks.  If I can pull this off, it goes all to God.  Another church friend told me he has contacts that could possibly get me a job doing graphic design in the technology field.  Technically, it's not quite the job I want in not quite the field I want, but... it's better than where I'm at?  I'm wondering if it would help me or hinder me, since the issue of schooling would figure into it.  Urgh!  (And why am I asking faceless internet voyeurs for career advice?)  I finally saw my doctor today (my new doctor... who I chose rather randomly off my insurance provider's website) and got a referral to see a dermatologist, whom I will see this Thursday.  I mentioned how I used everything for my acne including Retin A and Accutane, but the last thing I used was Proactiv and that's when my skin problem got worse, meaning the acne was gone but so was the moisture.  She said that she had patients who came in using Proactiv with worse problems.  Well, it's a crapshoot, I guess.  It works for a lot of people, but not all of them.  She also said something else, but before I go on with my story, this is a warning that what I'm about to share is of the female persuasion and therefore, if you feel like it will be too much information and you'd be uncomfortable knowing this about me, then stop reading.  (Hey, I'm not uncomfortable sharing.  It's all medical.)    Anyway, so we're going through the list of medical history stuff, and she asks me if I'm sexually active and I reply no, and she asks me if I'm a virgin and I say yes.  Then I launch into my story of how I've been menstruating now for fourteen years and my periods are still irregular and coming every 3 to 4 months though it was 7 months before my last one.  Well she says that next week we can do a complete physical including a pap smear (and possibly an ultrasound to check out my ovaries) but since I'm a virgin we should take care to preserve the membrane.     Yep.   The  membrane.  Y'see, my doctor is Pakistani, and I realized that that is a big thing in her culture.  One of the big thing among middle-eastern girls is the hymen-repair surgery.  Anyway, I just laughed and told her I didn't care about that and that I just wanted to make sure I'm healthy.  Anyway, I found that funny.  I mean, I suppose being able to bleed on your wedding night is... nice... I guess, but the whole saving-yourself-for-marriage thing is more a heart issue than a physical one.  Besides, I've been using tampons for years.  Even if I've got barely any membrane left, that doesn't mean I'm not a virgin.  Anyway, it's about time I see a doctor about my womanly problems.  Every time I share about my irregular schedule, most people are rather alarmed.  I even posted about it on WebMD and the nurse replied that it's not normal (though perfectly alright).  A part of me's kinda worried that maybe there's a problem there that's been festering for a decade.

						   Eh.  My school's having an Open House that would've been nice to go to on Friday, but I'm not quite willing to give up a 6.75 hr shift.  Erg.  So what am I doing up 'til 4 am on a school night?  Stupid homework.  Well, it's done.  (They better not trash it!)  But the worst part?  I didn't do the homework for the other class!  Argh!  Sigh, well, I get a half-hour break between classes.  It felt really good to have someone else be frustrated with our store as much as me.  It's been getting busy lately (I think maybe due to the time change cuz there seems to be more people out), and every time I've closed we've been busy right up to closing time.  In fact, we had to kick people out.  Good for business, I guess, but that just means that it takes us longer to clean up afterwards.  So the lead I closed with tonight and last Sunday was the same lead, and she was just promoted not too long ago.  But they've been totally on her case cuz of the hour overages.  And the reason why?  Cuz management gets a bonus for not going over too many hours.  (For those of you that don't know what "hours" are, basically, there's some formula to figure out how many people were needed to work however many hours that day based on that day's sales.  So when it's slow, the leads are supposed to send us home early.  Well, you can see what the problem is.  Slow times come in spurts.  You can't have extra people work in 15-min shifts.)  My manager's trying to get everyone to "take ownership of the store."  Meaning, we should want to work as hard as we can as fast as we can to make our store the best store in the world.  But it's hard to take ownership of a store when you don't get any benefits from working harder.  I worked my @$$ off and didn't get a raise, they cut my hours, and we had fewer people working when it was busy.  And what do we get for it?  More tips?  Hah!  More wages?  Double-hah!  We get a promise of a pizza party for good mystery shopper reports.  Ooooooh.  A pizza party.  Like that'll pay my bills.  There's a reason why a lot of companies offer profit-sharing.  But since we don't see any of the manager's bonuses, I don't see any logical reason to work any harder.  I mean, if they were at least honest and admit that they need the money and could we please help 'em out, well, that I can at least respect.  None of this phony-baloney "we're in this together" crap.  (On a side note, Starbucks does offer stock grants, but that's dependent on the successes of the company as a whole.  And it's a pretty rich company.  I doubt our store makes a dent in their total profits.)

						   Thanks for commenting, everybody.  I think that was a pretty heady question, and probably not a good one to post on my blog.  I guess I just wanted other people's thoughts on the idea.  I'll go into more detail in a bit, but I have another question to pose to y'all:   What is the correct way to wear a pashmina?  Over the shoulders or not?  The one I have is 100% rayon and therefore wrinkles easily, but is it supposed to be wrinkled to begin with?   I get in these funks about my career every now and then, though more now than ever.  I think it was spurned on by a lot of things, one being the recent drama at work.  Then, at a recent meeting for work, I wore my KCPC sweatshirt (the one that says Berkeley on it).  Most of the people there haven't seen me in regular clothes (meaning, not the standard dress code) so one of the guys started calling me "Berk."  It was cute.  Anyway, one of the leads (the one I'm not too crazy about, I might even go as far as to call her a b---h but that would be an insult to female dogs) asked me, "So why'd you leave Berkeley?"  My answer was, "Cuz I graduated."  Which was shortly followed by, "You graduated from Berkeley and you work here?"  I just replied, "Oh, I majored in art."  That'll get the laughs.  But on the inside I was cringing.  I guess my original thinking was that Starbucks would be a temporary stopover on my career path.  But more and more I realize that that might not be the case.  I think it's almost a crutch.  It would be different if I was on a clear-set path and there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  But right now I don't have set goals, just dreams, and I'm thinking more and more as long as I stay in Chino doing what I'm doing, then I'll get too comfortable in my misery.  But on the other hand, I'm also realizing that it would take a looot of money to move out....  Perhaps I'll do something crazy and start commuting every day to LA?  I mean, I gotta get some sort of internship and that might not coincide with my cozy 2-day school week.  Oh well....  My schedule for rest of week: Tue -- school Wed -- 6:30 to 10:45 pm Thu -- school Fri -- 1:00 to 8:15 pm Sat -- 5:00 pm to 12:15 am Sun -- Happy Easter!

						   A coupla things I forgot to mention:  I got a raise at work (yay!) of eleven cents an hour (boo!).  Woo-hoo, I'm rolling in the money now.  If I got it in pennies and spread it very thinly on the floor.  At work the other day, a girl's car stopped in the parking lot while I was taking out the trash.  She looked distressed and I asked her if she needed help.  Only when I started pushing her car (though at first I couldn't cuz she didn't put it in neutral, and I'm wondering why it's so hard) did someone else join in.  I did wait a few minutes before I asked if she wanted help cuz I wanted to finish taking out the trash.  However, since her hazards were on and she had that panicked stare in her eyes, I figured she was in distress.  It reminded me of the time my car overheated and stalled on the freeway.  I tried to pull over, but my car stopped halfway so that the butt-end was in the lane.  I tried pushing it myself but there's only so much you can do my yourself, especially if you're trying to push and steer at the same time.  It was early afternoon rush hour and there were plenty of cars on the road, moving rather slowly.  I called my mom to help but meanwhile, people drove by and no one offered to help.  BUT, a lot of people did roll their windows down and told me that the butt-end of my car was in the lane.  I think it was nearly fifteen minutes before somebody pulled over and asked me if I needed help.  I kept thinking of that while I was pushing this girl's car.  I mean, how dense are people that if they see a lone girl in distress with a car half-way pulled over with hazard light and steam coming out of the front, that they'd think I'm just stupid and decided to park randomly in the middle of the freeway?  Okay, gotta go.  SIGGRAPH awaits.  Tonight, people from Shrek 2!  And they're screening the entire movie!

						   So I'm guessing all my legions of fans have been watching  Colonial House  with me.  It's not quite the same as many of the other "House" series because this is less about the lack of technology and more about the strict lifestyle of the colonial times.  I think the series is focusing less on whether or not they can do the tasks set before them but more on whether they can adopt the attitude of the times and live by those rules.  It's kind of painful to see the negative portrayal of Christians (from both non-Christian and Christian point of view, I think), but it's also tough to compare our modern views of evangelism through love and encouragement with the societal brute force as was the case back then.  Last two episodes of the season tomorrow (er... tonight?)!  I'm trying to think what they can go to next, and in terms of American history, colonial times is as far back as you can go, I think, without resorting to pre-written-history.  I think England's doing more society-related series.  I remember reading about a project related to the Regency era and the various society laws and games that everyone played back then.  I'm thinking it'd be cool to do a "Native American House" project where halfway through the project the US Army will ride in and herd everyone into reservations.  Okay, more later on other goings on in my life, but my schedule for this week:  Tue -- school, then SIGGRAPH Wed -- 11:45 am to 3-ish, I'm not quite sure Thu -- school Fri -- 8 am to 1 pm, then drive to San Jose Sat & Sun -- San Jose!

						   Yay, comments!  Crunch time here.  The end of the semester's mere weeks away.  I'm chipping away at my projects, but I feel like I'm using a toothpick to pick at the Hoover Dam.  Slow but steady?  I think not.  More like panicked and hurried.  I'm trying to figure out how to support myself if I were to move out right now.  Perhaps I should actually try to be a lead at work.  The minimum pay is at least $9/hr.  Erg.  Or maybe I'll just do both Starbucks and Kaplan.  I would still be working for Kaplan if their hours were better.  Gnomon, this really great and really expensive private school for visual effects has evening and weekend classes so that people can have a  real  job while studying, but I'm not sure how they factor in internships there.  Hmmmm....  Well, the policeman's looking to close up the student center.  Tootaloo.

						   Back by popular demand... my weekly schedule!  Mon -- work from 3 to 4 pm that got cancelled Tue -- School all day, hopefully get there earlier to talk to a teacher Wed -- 9 am to 3:30 pm Thu -- afternoon class cancelled, evening class still goes on Fri -- no work, perhaps trip to hair salon w/ Mom Sat -- 7:30 pm to 12:45 pm Sun -- church, then 5 to 10 pm  So yeah, my review today got cancelled.  I was sort of dreading it, but I can't avoid it forever.  It got cancelled, though, when the Manager-Trainee didn't show up (and won't for the whole week) and my manager spent the day tracking her down as well as taking her kid to the doctor.  Her kids get sick a lot.  Well, perhaps cuz it's where she works, or with three kids (and one more on the way) one kid is bound to get get every other week.  Her kids are 5, 3, and 1.  BTW, did I mention that she's only turning 24 this year?  I've been procrastinating as usual, and it doesn't help that I'm sick today.  I'm not sure what it is, but I woke up this morning nauseous and threw up.  I haven't thrown up in a long time.  Ugh, it's awful.  Your throat burns from the stomach acid, and there wasn't much food I threw up since it had been digesting overnight.  Well, my hunger's back, sort of, but I can't eat just anything, and now I'm dealing with body aches and chills, and possibly a slight fever.  I'm wondering if this is food poisoning, though I can't think of what might have been tainted.  Even the milks I used in the drinks at work were first steamed to 150+ degrees.  I'm wary of taking tylenol or something just cuz I don't want my symtoms to last longer than they have to.  But enough about my innards....  One comment I want to make about the movie  A Wrinkle in Time  which was shown last Monday on ABC.   A Wrinkle in Time  is one of my favorite books, and I've read most of the sequels.  But I wasn't too happy with the movie, mainly cuz they tried to add too much modern psychology into it.  The book was written in the 60's, and they tried to update it too much, I think.  But for the most part, it is pretty faithful to the book.  They probably could have made the bad guy a lot more ominous if they had just invested in bigger special effects and didn't deal so much with Meg's emotional problems.  And I guess it was tough to cast a 6-yr-old genius since so few child actors can pull that off.  Anybody else see this movie?  Okay, feeling crappy still.  I'm going to take a nap.  Remember folks, watch  Colonial House  tonight on PBS!  (Oprah had a good show today, too, when she and Gayle visited the colony for two days.)

						   So Blogger has some new templates, so I thought I'd change it.  I like it, though it's not as "cute" as the dog one.  It reminds me of the PBS website for  Frontier House .  Speaking of which, the new series,  Colonial House  is going to start next Monday.  I invite everyone to watch it so when I make comments on it, you guys can respond accordingly.  It is a good series.  (For those of you that don't know, they got volunteers to live like colonists of the 1700s for five months and taped them.  An educational reality series, if you must.)  It'll be on May 17, 18, 24, 25 from 8 to 10 pm.  I should be sleeping right now, but I can't.  Too wired.  I've got four final projects due in four weeks.  Yikes.  I barely eked out a sound project for the midterm this week.  How am I going to eke out a final project?  I'm excited about my 2d and 3d animation projects, but if I want to make them good, then I'm going to have to spend a lot of time on them.  As the case goes, I haven't improved my model for 3d yet when my next week I should have the whole scene textured and lit, and I need to thumbnail for 2d as well as draw my keys but first I need to buy more paper!  Sigh.  Don't even get me started on the Illustrator project.  At least I have my image I'm going to copy.  Basically, it's creating a photorealistic image using Illustrator.  How is that possible, you ask?  Well, let's just say, it takes a lotta work.  I had a good shift tonight, though I let myself get goaded by the other guys.  There's the lead who I usually close with, and this other barista who he's friends with, and every little thing turns into something to rib me about.  Sometimes it's annoying, but on the other hand, it does make the shift more fun.  Less stressful.  Though I do get tired of, "Hey, what I  meant  to say was..."  Work in 4.75 hours.  What am I doing up?

						   Ooh, Blogger has a new interface.  It tells me that my last post was my 200th post.  Woo-hoo!  Y'know how I have a tendency to obsess over little things? (Now, it's not  every  little thing, just  some  little things.  Usually weird.  Like, I can obsess over how to save up for retirement, but not over keeping my room clean.)  Well, I've been obsessing, but more on that later.  Crunch time, sound project due in five hours....  BTW, I nearly crashed a gazillion times today cuz of a funeral procession.  Now it was sad cuz the deceased was an 18-yr-old kid, but the procession was huuuge, and the people in the tail-end didn't know squat about funeral etiquette and took up several lanes.  Now, that wouldn't be bad except that the procession on average was driving slower and had their hazard lights on, so they couldn't really signal lane changes.  So all the other cars were forced to weave in and out of this "procession" (more like a blob).  I mean, I couldn't help but get mad.  Dead kid or not, they nearly got us all killed.  Datzit fer nauw.

						   Tough week.  Anybody know how to learn rotoscoping or match-moving?  8.5 hr shift yesterday, though with the 30 min lunch, I think I missed out on any over-time.  My feelings over this job is a conundrum.  On one hand, I wanna get out.  On the other, that may not be the best move.  I gotta get myself an internship, but I'm not sure what to do about the money situation.  I doubt any regular job will let me take off a few days a week for an internship.  Perhaps I'll go the route of actors and become a waitress.  If it's at a fancy enough restaurant, there'll be plenty of tips.  But one the other hand... I'd have to be full-time at most places to get benefits.  Sigh.  I wonder if seeing a doctor is all that important.  I keep wavering between wanting to get out of Chino, too.  I don't want to be here, yet if it's possible for me to commute from there even for an internship, then I would, just cuz rent's so expensive.  I guess I ought to cross that bridge when I come to it.  I've been meaning to put together my reel for some time now.  Perhaps it will be deferred yet again to another vacation.  Oh well, gotta go.  I'm currently butting head with ProTools to try to put together something that sounds original and good at the same time.  Oh, did I mention I have no idea what I'm doing?

						   In response to my last entry's single comment, yes, it does seem like I have bad luck with parking.  I mean, I did get that parking ticket last semester (to save a quarter and it ended up costing me $35), then the towing, and last Thursday, they were re-paving the streets and I had to park far away and about twice what I normally pay cuz I got to school early and I wasn't sure how anal the metermaids were on that street (normally, I can ignore the last hour of the usual parking spots).  Only to find out that the school was letting everyone park in the school lot even if they didn't have a pass that day.  Argh.  Last Sunday we had our church's inaugural service.  It was pretty good.  The speaker, Pastor Alex Montoya, talked about seven rewards for serving Christ:  1.  Satisfaction of Fulfillment of our Purpose  2.  Blessed Joy of Helping Other People  3.  Serving Others is the Way You Serve Christ  4.  Opportunity to Experience the Power of God  5.  Joy of Knowing as You Serve You are Going to Grow Spiritually  6.  Recognize that Serving Glorifies God  7.  Well Done, Good and Faithful Servant  That last one....  Pastor Montoya talked about how he slacked off in high school and barely managed to graduate.  However, after the graduation ceremony, his father looked at him with tears in his eyes and said, "I'm proud of you."  And he thought, for what?  And he vowed that the next graduation his father attends, he will have something worthy to be proud of.  Anyway, it got me thinking, when the final day comes and I stand before God, will there be a reason for Him to say to me, "Well done, good and faithful servant"?  On a different note, I worked at a store in Claremont today.  Cra-a-azy.  They ran out of ice.  ICE!  I mean, that cuts the menu by 2/3, and 90% of their sales on a hot day like today.  Sooo busy.  Manual labor for little pay sucks.

						   Hey Erica... did I not tell you about SpaceShipOne? :-P  Anyway, yeah, it was a fun day, though technically there wasn't much to see.  The flight itself took place against the sun, so we were all squinting and trying not to fry out our eyes.  But it was still exciting cuz we were seeing it live (when I say "we", I mean the 20,000 people there) and it was a lot of "do you see where it is?" and "oh there it is!" and me thinking, "how the heck can these people actually see this?"  Anyway, it was exciting cuz we were witnesses to history, but afterwards, I was dead tired.  It took me a week to recover.  'course, my wacked sleeping pattern didn't help.  Last night I went out with work people as a night out to say good-bye to people that left.  Well, mainly two of 'em, though more people are leaving or have left.  My manager's leaving at the end of the week to go on maternity leave.  By the time she comes back, I hope to not be there anymore.  Boy can people drink.  Funny how I got carded yet the 18-yr-old with the scraggly goatee-beginnings didn't.  I don't know how many of my readers are Christian, but if you believe in prayer of any sort, I could use some of it.  My car is now parked in our garage, and I'm not sure what will happen to it.  It's almost too good to junk, yet too junky to fix.  I'm driving my brother's old car which has been on its last legs for a long time.  My mom and dad are stressed from life in general, and this car issue ain't helping.  I suppose if anything, my biggest prayer request is that God grant us a peace of mind and the will to do what He requires of us and trust that He's got everything under control.  Most of us like to whine about "why me?" but I'm hoping to take Job's lead and thank God for His steadfastness nonetheless.  Besides, I've learned that the only thing "why me?" gets you is looking pathetic.  Long one.  I'll post more at school, no doubt.  After all, it's hard to go through 8 am to 5 pm without some mental breaks.  My schedule: Wed -- 3:45 to 10 pm Thu -- hanging out with Robert, then heading off to Santa Monica Fri -- class ALL day Sat -- 6:15 to 11:15 am Sun -- church,  Happy Independence Day!

						   Crazy week.  It started off Sunday night when after getting out of work late after a closing shift, I drove to Santa Monica to meet up with Dave, and then we drove an hour-and-a-half to the Mojave Airport and arrived there around 3 am.  Yep, we went to see the  urlLink historic flight  of SpaceShipOne, the first privately-funded spaceship to reach sub-orbital height.  It was crazy cuz we barely got any sleep, there were thousands of people there, and the winds were harsh and cold at 3 am.  It was hard to keep an eye on the ship as it flew into the air, and when it made it's rocket-propelled flight, all we could see is a straight contrail into the sun.  But if was awfully exciting.  Perhaps I'll go into details later.  The other part of my crazy week involved making a mistake on my schedule and requesting the wrong day off and having to find someone to cover my shift tomorrow so I can go to class.  More on that later.  Gotta go.

						   Just squeaked by with enough hours to continue my health benefits for the next three months.  Well, technically four.  I think I should go see my dermatologist again, even though he sees me for all of five minutes per visit, and I have to pay the office $25.  $5 per minute?  Dang.  It sucks to be so close to "making it" yet so far away.  A part of me wants to stop living so hard and get myself a real 9-to-5 job and be able to buy a new car and such.  But then where would I be?  The hope that all this is leading somewhere is my only reason for continuing to work at a place I'm not too crazy about with wages I'm definitely not crazy about (speaking of which... when's my raise gonna kick in???).  Sucky day today.  Shoulda done my research last night instead of this morning.  But then, I'm not one for planning much.  Especially during veg-cation.

						   Doh!  Common HTML posting mistake: failing to close a tag.  My schedule for this week: Tue -- school Wed -- 1:30 to 6:30 pm Thu -- free day, hanging out w/ Robert Fri -- 12 to 5:45 pm Sat -- 7:45 pm to 12:45 am Sun -- church, then 4:15 to 11 pm  Can't get myself to be productive....  I feel a little guilty about my job.  Basically, I am enticing people to spend a lot of money on stuff they shouldn't consume.  I mean, yeah, I'm not exerting sales pressure or anything like a used car, but (in my friendly way) when people lament about the calories and fat and sugar and such, I just say, "Y'know, you can't think about that stuff when you come in here."  But there are rather obese people that come everyday and order huge frappuccinos, and there are so many kids that ask for extra caramel, and when they look at the tall size (i.e. the "small") they say, "Hey, could I get something bigger?" and adults come in with their kids and they're more concerned about the caffeine content of their kids' drinks than their nutritional value.  And today (or was it yesterday?) I saw an overweight woman (who was probably obese but I didn't get a chance to see the lower half of her body) who ordered a venti frappuccino of some type and then gave her daughter, who seemed about three years of age, a  grande  (medium) strawberry-and-creme frapp, and this little girl was sucking down that drink.  Now, she was too young to be overweight (she did have a tummy, but a kiddie-tummy and not a gut), but I can see why obesity tends to run in families (genetics-besides).  I mean, a lot of kids whine for larger sizes but most of the parents I've noticed orders the tall for their kids (unless they're teens), so I was rather surprised that this woman ordered a grande for a girl that probably wasn't old enough to whine for larger sizes.  People are rather surprised that our "kids" sizes are so small (they're the "short" cups, yeah, there is a counterpart to the "tall" size), but they are 8 oz cups.  More than enough for most small kids.  My church has decided to apply for membership in the Southern Baptist Convention.  I'm just hoping it's not the same one as the one with Jerry Falwell.  So far I hear no.  (shudder)

						   It's okay.  You don't  have  to comment.  My schedule's not up cuz I got too busy, and I can't post it now cuz I'm at school and I don't remember what my hours were.  Um, but I do know that I have Saturday afternoon/evening off.  Anybody wanna hang?  Actually, I should be working on my final projects.  Two outta four done!  Everyone liked my animation today.  My teacher said that the timing was pretty good and I put enough secondary action to make it interesting.  I'm not sure what he saw since I didn't have time to put deliberate secondary action, but hey, I ain't complaining.  I just made sure my poses were really good, and I guess that's the key. (That's the  key ... get it??? Har har har.)    Anyway, I gotta be more diligent.  I stayed up 'til 6 am this morning to work on it (and let it render while I slept) but I probably coulda started earlier.  I also have this bad habit of taking a nap cuz I know I'll be staying up late.  Ech.  Something due Thursday and something due next Tuesday.  Well, that ain't too bad.  On the work front, we had one barista leave, one lead is transferring, one lead got promoted, and I'm guessing that as soon as my co-worker starts his teaching position, he's going to leave, too.  Which means that by the time my manager leaves for her maternity leave she has to hire four more people.  It's making me antsy about what to do about my own exit strategy.  Should I wait until after summer, or ASAP?  It's courteous to give a two-week's notice, though I think in our store's case, it'd be better to give 'em a month.  Hmmm... what to do....

						   I'm getting a lot more hours at work it seems.  My paranoid (yet perhaps correct) mind thinks it's because my review went well and there wasn't an issue I had to raise a stink about.  However, it's also because one of our recent hires (I say a little more than 3 months) is quitting.  She recently got her bar certification, which means that she would have gotten a mini-review, and maybe there was some "suggestions" made to her.  Well, it's all speculative at this point.  There seems to be another issue with another person regarding state-mandated breaks vs actual breaks.  More final projects await!  Here's what I got:    New soundtrack to a clip from the old X-men cartoon (with Wolverine in his underwear!)  2D animation of a french toast talking to a bagel bartender  3D animation of a guy executing a flying roll, followed by a roundhouse, sidekick, and then a flying spin heel kick breaking a board    So now that I've got you all excited about it, you'll never see them!  Why?  Cuz video is too big to host on my website!  (muahahahahahah)  ...must sleeeeeeeeep...

						   The holiday weekend was fun.  My brother drove the entire way to and back, so it wasn't that hard for me.  So for the life of me, I can't figure out why I'm so tired.  School's winding down.  I realize that my very first Illustrator drawing of Yakko is completely lost since I never saved it on my home computer and I deleted it off my Yahoo briefcase.  I can only hope that it was saved on my student folder at school.  I mean, it wasn't that hard to do (it took about an hour and half) but I don't want to do it over again.  Anyway, my Illustrator class is ending this week (well, we're taking the final this week, at least) and she wanted us to take our projects and make it into a website.   Shrek 2  is a great movie.  I liked the first one better, but mainly cuz it's hard to tell a story after the happily ever after.  But it is sooo funny, chock-full of jokes.  Antonio Banderas's Puss-in-Boots was there mainly for comic relief more than a plot device, but he was funny.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the kingdom of Far Far Away ws hy-larious.  Especially Farbucks.  Heh heh.  I had an interesting discussion with my bro-in-law over the weekend about tips.  Do I think I deserve my tips?  The answer is yes.  But not because I'm providing any better service than to those who do not tip.  But because they don't pay me enough so that the tips make up for the wages they  should  be paying me.  I think I need a better job.  But what other job out there is as flexibly scheduled with an equal or higher pay (plus benefits)?  My schedule for this week: Tue -- school Wed -- 11:45 am to 4 pm Thu -- school Fri -- 2:45 to 9 pm Sat -- 8 pm to 12:15 am Sun -- 4:30 to 11:15 pm

						   Maybe I'm trolling around too much for comments when none of y'all have any.  'sokay.  As many of you know, I did a stupid thing and procrastinated on my last week's homework project.  So basically, after a 7.5-hr shift on Thursday night, I drove to Santa Monica and pulled an all-nighter so I could turn in my project at 8 am the next morning.  Let's just say, that was hell.  (BTW, thanks Dave for all your help!)  (See how I give shout-outs?  I tend to give more to those who leave comments.  Hint hint.  Heehee.)  So I have to make sure to finish this week's assignment this weekend.  Why?  Well, you'll see when I post my schedule!  Though most of you already know.  I was driving a co-worker crazy today from my recitations of various lines from  Romeo and Juliet .  Yep, Shakespeare.  Well, that's what happens when you're forced to memorize a monologue in ninth grade and it sticks.  I mean, don't y'all have something that you memorized eons ago that you just can't forget?

						   How sad am I that I would rather search the internet to find out if the person that looked familiar at Jennifer's wedding was actually that person rather than walk up to her and ask her directly.  Speaking of, that wedding... man....  It was beautiful because the sentiments were beautiful.  I just wish I could've gotten there on time.  Who knew the 10 and the 101 would be so awful on a Saturday afternoon?  Anyway, typical Korean wedding with gazillions of guests.  The after-party at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel was much better.  The chances of my getting married is pretty slim at this point, but if I ever do, I so want to elope.  Or at least not have such a huge wedding.  Since my car's been out to pasture, I've been driving my brother's old beamer.  People have been complementing it, and I've been down-playing it.  I don't know why.  Most people love having flashy cars, but I think I'd rather drive the Camry with the bashed up front than the BMW.  Maybe because it's an old beamer with crappy insides.  Or maybe it's because it projects a false view of my current financial state.  I just feel uncomfortable having nice stuff, it seems.  My schedule this week: Mon -- no work! Tue -- 4:15 am to 12:15 pm Wed -- 6 am to 12 pm Thu -- 4:15 to 11:45 am Fri -- school Sat -- 6:30 pm to 12:45 pm Sun -- church, 4:30 to 9:30 pm

						   Should be paying attention in class....  Korean drumming = hard, but cool.  Wish I could take more.  Reminds me of college where possibilities numbered in the billions and time remained 24/7.  Wish my projects didn't suck so much.  What you put in is what you get.  Blah.  Nothing new to wear to Jennifer's wedding tomorrow.  Tried looking.  Legs too short for most fashions now.  (Just-under knee skirts too popular.  Not wearing "short-short" skirts.)  Perhaps my calling is in fashion.  Not "petite."  More like "short regular folk."  Would make a fortune.  I call it!  Complete sentences = bad  Tootaloo mon rendezvous!

Fri -- school Sat -- Jennifer's wedding Sun -- church, then 7 to 11:45 pm  Another store called and begged me to cover a shift yesterday.  I guess they thought it'd be crazy like last year.  Turns out, people have either gotten more lazy, or the fact that it was a Sunday kept people away.  Only poor retail schmoes had to work yesterday and today.  At least I got paid time-and-a-half.  Like that means much.  It's been a week of highs and lows.  Turns out, I am poor enough to qualify for fee waivers for school.  I got a reduced fee parking pass only to get a parking ticket that day cuz I forgot to move my car during the break.  Sigh.  I should take advantage of the free counseling offered to me through school and work (I think I get three free sessions each.)  I don't know if I have to guts.  I put on a happy face for other people, and it feels genuine.  Perhaps it's the weird dichotomy of my personality where I am an introverted people person.  That is, I prefer the company of myself to other people, but then I prefer the company of a few close friends to just myself.  Anyway, I think the act of putting on a happy face forces you to feel happy, even if you'd rather wallow and mope.  Which then makes me think that's just life.  That we are all miserable creatures 'til we are forced to not be one.  Or maybe I'm just screwed up.  My sister and her husband (and their dog) drove down for the weekend at the last minute.  I didn't see her much as I ended up working, sleeping, or elsewhere.  I felt a little guilty "appropriating gratuitous beverages" for them... but it's like, what else kind of hookups are there?  Perhaps I'll just dive into a stupor of my drug of choice: TV.  I saw  Spiderman 2  last week.  Abso-freakin'-lutely great movie.  Very satisfying to a Spidey-fan.  So much so that me, Miss Miser-in-Denial, is willing to  pay  to see it in the theaters again.  Ooooooh.

						   Through my old roomate's blog, I found out that one of the hapkido instructors (well, technically the wife of the head instructor) back in my days of Berkeley has breast cancer.  urlLink Her blog  which is fascinating.  I hope she'll make it through okay.   City of Heroes  is a fun game.  I even managed to come out of it tonight without getting nauseous.  Yeah, I think I get motion-sickness from video games with a lot of first-person scenery.  (The character is always facing the same direction, but the scenery moves... like first-person shooters except the character's in front of you.)  My main character is a Batgirl-esque character, stemming from Robert's supergroup led by his Batman-esque character.  Her costume's a bit slutty, I realize, cuz I was going for an overall aesthetic effect and ended up with a... well, a slutty outfit.  I wonder what that says about me.  I will post screen shots soon.  I've been creating characters just for kicks, mainly just for looks.  It's kinda like doodling or playing with a complex Mr. Potato-Head.  I think the appeal (about superheroes in general) are that they are an extension of your fantasy self.  These characters can be as tall or muscular as you want, wear stuff you can't find or don't dare, and they can be of any color.  That's another thing.  With my Batgirl character, I was trying to make her skin tone a tannish color so that she looks like a cross between a tanned white girl and a fair Asian girl.  Well, I must have picked wrong cuz she just looks pale.  It was making me think about if my fantasy self was Asian, or if I'm like the negative stereotype that all minorities secretly want to be white.  I've been trying to find a link, but so far all I have is this:  urlLink Candorville    urlLink U-Comics   Try to look at the August 3rd comics for both  Candorville  (which I remember as  Lemont Brown  from the Berkeley days) and  La Cucharacha .  I just thought "La Cucharacha" was funny cuz I was at work when I read that.  And "Candorville" just made me think about how my parents must see me.  Sigh.  Tired.  Must sleep.

						   Schedule this week:  Mon -- 5 to 10 pm Tue -- 1:15 to 7:45 pm Wed -- 7:15 to 11:45 pm Thu -- 1 to 7:30 pm Fri -- no work, no school, YAY Sat -- 6 pm to 12:45 am Sun -- church, no work!     Vegas was so fun and time just flew by.  The best part?   urlLink Star Trek: The Experience  at the Las Vegas Hilton.  We did both the Klingon Encounter and Borg 4-D, and they were both great.  Pricey, but worth it.  (And you know me, Miss Miser, don't say that about a lot of things.)  I think I like the Klingon one better because it had a surprise beginning, but getting assimilated was pretty cool, too.  What can I say?  Geek heaven.  In the gambling front, I think I ended up ahead by about $5.  I took about $40 in gambling money as well as a roll of quarters (though some of that was used for the arcade) and I ended up winning about $50 on a video poker machine, as well as $5 on megabucks (hey, the pot's too tempting to not try) as well my very last quarter turning into $2.  Cool beans.  We also went to the  urlLink Shark Reef Aquarium  at Mandalay Bay.  Pretty cool.  Too bad the pictures didn't quite turn out right.  And the buffets!    So coming home sucked cuz we knew that vacation was over and there was a lot of stuff waiting for us back home.  Well at least for me.  Cuz as soon as I came back, we returned the rental car, then I had dinner, took a nap, worked on my final project for class, and then drove to Santa Monica, and then proceeded to finish my project for my 8 am class the next day.  Ugh.  Hard.  But no school for a month!     My (new) manager wants to talk to me today before my shift.  I am getting nervous.  I have to keep reminding myself that it's just a job and if it doesn't involve God, Family, or Friends, then it's not that important.
