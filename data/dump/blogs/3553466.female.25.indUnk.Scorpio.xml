      I had my last psychopathology project due today.  I woke up at 7:00am, rolled out of bed, put my eyes in, and left for the library.  Oh, and I got dressed.  Anyway, to make a very long and very boring story shorter, I spent the next seven hours sitting intently at my computer, and at 3:30 I handed in about 30 pages of fascinating information on what can go wrong with your brain.    So then I came home, took one look at the mirror and thought to myself, "Geez, I look like crap!"  And I do.  It's not that today was really any different than any other day this year, it's just that with my mind not on schoolwork for once, I finally had the brain-space to notice my appearance.  And it is NOT a pretty thing.    Seriously, I don't know anything that is more tough on your looks than graduate school.  First there was the whole balding fiasco, but even without that...ugh!  I just don't have time to care what I look like.  I pull my hair in a ponytail, put on only the bare minimum of make-up, and walk out the door in the clothes I slept in that night.  I think every piece of clothing I own comes from either Goodwill, Ross, or Payless.  But I decided today that it had to stop.  I went out and got my haircut, bought a curling iron at Target (can you believe I haven't used one for almost two years, since I left my old one in Walnut Creek??), and...well, okay, since it was so late in the day, I didn't really do anything, except shower, which was good.  But I WILL curl my hair tomorrow, dammit.   That's all.  Thank you and goodnight.

      It's been a busy weekend here at 2961 1/2.  Nienna's two friends were in town, so they've spent the last few days sleeping on our couch.  They're both cool, and I've been having fun, but one of them said something the other morning that made me think, "Well now THAT'S stupid!"    We were discussing books (for some reason people who visit are always in awe of the number of books I have) and I was asking if she'd read such-and-such a book and she said, "No, I actually don't read fiction."    "Why not?" said I.  "Well, I don't think I read my scriptures enough," she said. "And I think I should read them more before I read fiction."  Yes, yes, I know you are all thinking "Well now THAT'S stupid!" just like I was.  I almost said it out loud, actually, but I just met the girl that morning, and I try to spare people the full force of my personality before breakfast. Seriously though, we could take her idea a step farther and just say, well, we're never going to be perfect, so let's just stop doing ALL good things.  They just pale in comparison anyway.    Right.  Aside from that faulty logic though, I get REALLY bothered when people don't take fiction (or more accurately "stories," fictional or not) seriously.  Presenting a full explanation of  why  would take more time than I have tonight, but let me just give you the nutshell version.  I've learned a lot from reading stories.  A LOT.  Storytelling is one of the most effective teaching skills there are.  I think part of the reason for that is that in stories, the characters are a step removed from the reader, which allows that reader to learn valuable lessons without their pride getting in the way.  For example, look at the parables told in the New Testament.  When we read the story of the Good Samaritan, we can examine in our hearts what it truly means to be someone's neighbor, far better and at far deeper a level than we could if the same message were merely told to us:  Be nice to people you hate (okay, I know the message is more encompassing than that, but you get the drift).  Kierkegaard wrote his greatest works with pseudonyms for this very purpose.  Storytelling is a time honored teaching-technique of humanity, mostly because it works very, very well.   The other reason I think stories are important is because each one is, in some sense, an act of creation.  When I was taking creative writing from Master Findecáno at BYU, he said something to us that I have pondered on a lot.  In writing stories, he said, "You can create worlds without number."  I truly believe that we are here on earth to learn to be like God, and what greater way to learn than to create?   Now I realize that not all fiction is good fiction.  But learning to tell the difference between the good and the bad is something that, at least partially, comes with practice.  Stories that teach us to be better people should be read and savored and re-told again.  And when you DO find a story that speaks to your heart, and you use it to create a more thoughtful, emotional, moral self, you are in a very literal sense holding the chaos at bay and helping to create order in the universe (or so I believe anyway, I suppose I could be off my rocker).  Studying the scriptures is important.  I get that.  I'm not saying we should  stop  in order to read novels.  But I AM trying to highlight why reading stories is not something we should do to escape reality.  It's something we should do to create reality.

      This will be short, but here are three things that absolutely drive me nuts.  1.  People who refer to those individuals that have completed a mission as "Return Missionaries."  If they have RETURNED from a mission, then they are RETURNED Missionaries, not Return Missionaries.  I hear this (and see it written) way too often.  It's like those people who say "I could care less."  It's "I COULDN'T care less."  When people say that they could care less, that means that they do care at least a little bit - which is the opposite of what they generally mean.  Yeah, that last bit had nothing to do with the gospel.  Sorry, when I get talking about pet peeves, I just can't stop.  2.  People who call President Hinckley (or any other church leader, or old person for that matter) "cute."  Bunnies are cute.  Little baby chicks are cute.  Prophets are not cute.  End of story.  3.  "In Our Lovely Deseret."  I wonder if there is a single Mormon alive who takes this song seriously.  I think someone put it in the hymnbook on a dare, to see if anyone would actually sing it.  And what do you know, people do.    I sound so curmudgeonly tonight!  Sorry, I'll be more cheerful next time.

      Sometimes I really wonder if I knew what I was getting myself into with this whole counseling thing.  I have this new roommate, Ránëwén Telrúnya, and she is really cool.  We've only been roommates for about 2 weeks, but in that time (and mostly because of my major) I've been asked my opinion regarding her issues with her sister, her father, her boyfriend, her sister-in-law...it's not that I mind really.  We've only known each other a short time, but we're friends.  I like her.  I like listening to her, and helping her out if I can.    I guess it's just lonely.  I feel like I'm involved in all these people's lives at a startlingly personal level, but I still just really long for my own relationships.  I mean, I do have my own relationships, but nearly all of them are not anywhere in San Diego (with a few notable exceptions).  I miss them.  I miss you, if you're close enough to be reading this.  I really just want to be able to sit down and have a conversation with someone, and know that I can be a part of that person's life and not be expected to fix everything.    I don't know if I know how to have compassion and empathy for people, and still remain objective.  Maybe objectivity is stressed too much?  Maybe I just need to break down and admit to people that I'm human too?  I don't know.  But I think learning how to balance all of this is a process, and I'm really not quite there yet.  Sometimes the process, though always worthwhile, is just difficult.  I suspect that's why I was thinking about Plato's cave analogy the other day.  Sigh...such a useful analogy for so much of life.

      Plato had this theory of metaphysics (which I won't get into here), and as a part of this theory, he outlined an analogy of a cave (which I will get into here, and take some happy-fun liberties while doing so.  You want the real thing, go read the Republic).  In the cave are people, facing the wall, restrained somehow so that the only thing they see is the wall in front of them.  They can't see each other, they can't turn their heads and look behind them out the mouth of the cave.    The light shines from the outside world behind them onto the cave walls in front of them.  Occasionally, animals or other creatures would run past the mouth of the cave, or the wind would blow and the tree branches would sway, and the shadows would be displayed on the cave wall in front of people.    To the people facing the cave wall, these shadows are all that they know.  They've never even looked behind them at the mouth of the cave, let alone ventured into that world.  To these people, the shadows on the cave wall ARE reality.    Now suppose that something happens, and suddenly the people in the cave are able to move around freely--they can turn around and see the light.  What do you think would happen?  Upon seeing the real world for the first time, would these people be happy?  Not a chance.  They would be miserable.  It would hurt, for one thing, to see the light and the colour for the first time after spending a lifetime staring at cave shadows.  It would be incredibly uncomfortable to see the real world, and maybe some of these cave dwellers would want to just stay in the cave forever because it's comfortable.  It's what they know, and it's safe.  Some people, though, might go out and explore the real world.  Sure it would be really uncomfortable, but after a while they would learn how to function in this new life.  And one thing is for sure - after having seen what really exists outside the cave walls, you would no longer ever be satisfied with just shadows.  Sorry this is long, but now I'll get to the point:  I have thought about this particular analogy a lot in the past few years, and I find a lot of parallels in everyday life.  There are opportunities each of us have in life to leave our individual caves.  Some people take these opportunities, some people are happy to stare at the shadows on the cave wall.  Leaving the cave totally and completely sucks, at least for a while.  But once you stretch yourself (mentally, physically, socially, emotionally, whatever) and see what the world has to offer, you can't go back.  The cave will never again be enough for you.  By staying in the cave, you may have saved yourself some discomfort.  But you really limit the complexity of joy you can experience in life.    So what am I trying to say?  Just...live.  Don't be content with shadows, when you can have the real thing.

      My roommate rented  The Two Towers  last night and so I sat and watched it with her.  I guess I was in kind of a symbolic mood (and I've been thinking about all that changing the world stuff from the other day), because I started thinking about which character in LOTR I feel the most connected to.  It's a tough one (part of the beauty of Tolkein's work is that we can see bits of ourself in all the characters), but right now I really identify with Eowyn.  She's this young woman who has been raised as a leader among her people and she has big dreams.  She wants to fight for her people, she wants to protect them, she wants to be a part of the big things in the world and experience the excitement and the glory.  Eowyn doesn't want to sit at home while everyone else is out saving the world!  What good is that?  And then, she (initially) falls in love with Aragorn, who epitomizes everything she wants to be.  He's strong, he's honorable, he's courageous and a good leader, and she knows that by his side she'd find everything she's ever dreamed of and ever wanted...or at least everything she thinks she's ever wanted.  And the last thing she wants from him is his gentle understanding and pity (which is, of course, what she gets).  The movies didn't really do Eowyn's transition any justice, but when I read  Return of the King  I was really moved by her story.  After having gone out and taken part in the fighting, she comes back to the houses of healing.  But she is not truly healed until she understands her own heart clearly.  And because Tolkein says it so much better than I can, let me quote:   "I stand in Minas Anor, the Tower of the Sun," she said; "And behold! the Shadow has departed!  I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying.  I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren."  And again she looked at Faramir.  "No longer do I desire to be a queen."   Instead of continuing her unrequited love for Aragorn, she chooses to love Faramir, the unambitious second-son who shares her newfound love of life, the man with a heart so strong and pure that he was able to resist the temptation of the ring's power, where his own brother could not.  And although Faramir was a great leader in his own right, he never desired glory.    The reason I love Eowyn's story is because I feel a little like her in my life right now.  For so long, I dreamed of being this great, renowned person that would save the world (or at least make a major contribution to saving the world, and it wouldn't be major enough if the world didn't know about it).  But now, I'm starting to realize that this is not my calling (as it is Aragorn's, for instance).  My decision is like Eowyn's, to be a healer and love life, and cultivate that love in those around me.  In this way will I have changed the world.  Now if only my Faramir would show up...*taps foot impatiently*

      Okay, I LOVE those Reese Peanut Butter Cups with white chocolate.  Oh, yum.  I don't even like the original kind very much, but those white chocolate ones...oh geez, my mouth is watering and I just ate two.  Also, my new favorite country singer is Keith Urban.  Have you guys heard that song "You'll Think of Me"?  It was on the radio the other night when I was driving home in the dark, and I totally almost started crying in my car.  (I know, I know, I say I'm not a drama-queen, but I totally am.  I hope you don't feel too misled.)  And lastly, news from my psychopathology class, where we were discussing general physical health and some risk factors:  depression and anxiety have massively huge effects on your physical health.  People who are depressed show more susceptibility to immune problems, catch colds easier, are less able to fight off sickness, and are much more at risk for any number of very serious problems like heart disease and cancer and stuff.    Seriously, people, learn how to be happy, and learn it now.  Life's too short to be miserable.

      I was wondering, is there anything sexier than a man taking off his suit jacket to go cook dinner?  I don't think so.  But I do think that I've become very domestic lately, which is sort of a new thing for me.  Now, about changing the world.  My mom told me once (when I was complaining about not changing the world enough) that the best thing you can do is work within your circle of influence, and then constantly work to expand your circle of influence.  This is really good advice.  To that I would add my own thought:  really, the only thing I sort of regret in life is that I didn't start trying to change the world earlier on, like in high school.  It's frustrating, you know, because in high school you feel really powerless to do things, or at least I did.  But I could've gone and volunteered somewhere.  That's a really good start (and not only does it give you a chance to help people, it also gives you great references for college, graduate school, careers.  The volunteer work I did in college is why I'm in grad school today).  It doesn't have to be anything big either, but it does have to BE.  I'm not trying to be preachy or anything, I'm just passing along something I wish I would have done, so that people younger than me can take advantage of my mistakes.  Just a thought...  Also, I found this book-quote that I think might fit here, so bear with me because it's a bit long.    "What good is a life lived as if it made no difference to the great life of the world?  A sadder thing I cannot imagine.  Why should not a mother say to herself, if I raise this child right, if I love and care for her, she shall live a life that brings joy to those about her, and thus I have changed the world?  Why should not the farmer that plants a seed say to his neighbor, this seed I plant today will feed someone, and that is how I change the world today?....This is life.  And no one has time not to think of such things.  Each creature in the world should consider this thing, every moment of the heart's beating.  Otherwise, what is the point of arising each day?" --"Royal Assassin" page 201  There's my thought for this lovely Sunday morning.  Have you ever heard that theory that the flap of a butterfly's wing can cause a hurricane on the other side of the world?  Be the butterfly.

      Is anyone interested in some really great reading material?  I picked up this fantasy trilogy last year that was recommended to me by some guy on the internet.  Anyway, it's called The Farseer Trilogy and is written by Robin Hobb (the books in order go Assassin's Aprentice, Royal Assassin, and Assassin's Quest).  I don't know if anyone besides me reads fantasy stuff, but if you do, you simply HAVE to get these books.  All I can say is that I was so emotionally swept up in this story, I walked around in my little dreamworld for a good month or so (for me, this is a good thing, but it might not be for you so don't say I didn't warn you).  If anyone wants more info, I'll be happy to email it to you.  So I got home taught yesterday.  My home teacher is this guy named Huor Vanimedlë (again, elvish) and he's a physician's assistant at the hospital here.  Anyway, he was telling me about this teenage girl he saw the other day, who came into the emergency room with severe stomach pains.  When Huor x-rayed her, he discovered that she had swallowed two pens and a key.  What??  He said, "Hey, can you tell me why you swallowed two pens and a key?" and the girl replied, "I got depressed."  Anyway, Huor and his collegues when in and removed the pens from the girl's intestine and everything seemed fine.  But then, when he went to check on her the next day, she said, "I got depressed again and swallowed the batteries in the remote control for the TV."  I had never heard of depression manifesting itself this way (in fact, I suggested that this might be a form of Manchausen's syndrome, where people will deliberately hurt themselves in order to receive doctor attention).  So I checked with my psychopathology teacher and what do you know, she suggested Manchausen's too.    So I guess the moral of the story is that there are better ways to deal with depression than swallowing batteries, and that I'm getting better at this psychopathology assessment thing.  Go me!  Last but not least, I made THE BEST beef stir-fry the other day, and if anyone is looking for a good stir-fry recipe, I've got one.    Have a happy fun day everybody!

      I had an epiphany last night while watching back-to-back episodes of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" and it is this:  Why  shouldn't  straight men invest in a good facial cleanser???  Seriously, in the past I've had a tendency to go for those grunting manly types (for example, Beren Earfalas) (not his real name, for the purposes of anonymity, I will only refer to people by their elvish names).  But as I was watching these five gay guys on TV last night, I decided that while I may be superficially attracted to insensitive macho men, I really would rather marry someone who is clean and cooks good food, dresses well, and knows something about decorating.  Honestly, there is no reason for guys to act and dress and home-decorate like slobs in order to retain their masculinity.  So thank you Fab 5, you are providing a valuable human service.  And on a slightly related topic, here in San Diego they have this guy who comes on the radio to give the "Queer tip of the day," and he is so great.  The other day he goes, "Florescent lighting is to gays what sunlight is to vampires."  I am so with him on that.  I'm really fussy about lighting issues too.  Now, totally switching gears for a moment, I learned something really interesting in my psychopathology class yesterday.  We were talking about the neurological research on depression and anxiety disorders.  People with these problems often show a different brain structure than people who don't have these problems (which I knew already).  However, with time and therapy and learning how to control their thoughts, depressed and anxious people not only can get better, but can actually, literally change their brain structure!  Weird, huh?  It's interesting because we have just barely scratched the surface of what the human brain is capable of, and I'm excited to see the new research that will come out of this.  But what really excites me is realizing that individuals can have a lot more power over their mental state than many people believe.  Well, okay, I have always believed this, but it's nice to know I've got some research backing me up.

      CE HE MISE LE ULAINGT?/THE TWO TREES by William Butler Yeats (happy thoughts sent your way to the person who can tell me what it's about!)  Beloved, gaze in thine own heart The holy tree is growing there; From joy the holy branches start And all the trembling flowers they bear. The changing colours of its fruit Have dowered the stars with merry light; The surety of its hidden root Has planted quiet in the night; The shaking of its leafy head Has given the waves their melody. And made my lips and music wed, Murmuring a wizard song for thee, There the Loves a circle go,  The flaming circle of our days, Gyring, spiring to and fro In those great ignorant leafy ways; Remembering all that shaken hair And how the winged sandals dart Thine eyes grow full of tender care;  Beloved, gaze in thine own heart.   Gaze no more in the bitter glass The demons, with their subtle guile, Lift up before us when they pass, Or only gaze a little while; For there a fatal image grows That the stormy night receives, Roots half hidden under snows, Broken boughs and blackened leaves. For all things turn to bareness In the dim glass the demons hold, The glass of outer weariness, Made when God slept in times of old. There, through the broken branches, go The ravens of unresting thought; Flying, crying, to and fro, Cruel claw and hungry throat, Or else they stand and sniff the wind, And shake their ragged wings: alas!  Thy tender eyes grow all unkind: Gaze no more in the bitter glass. Beloved, gaze in thine own heart, The holy tree is growing there; From joy the holy branches start, And all the trembling flowers they bear. Remembering all that shaken hair  And how the winged sandals dart, Thine eyes grow full of tender care; Beloved, gaze in thine own heart.

      So today during psychopathology, I found out that one of my best friends in the program just withdrew.  Withdrew!  Ack!  I guess I'm not even terribly surprised, because I could kind of see that the stress was getting to her.  I feel both better and worse than I did - better because I feel more normal about my hair falling out, and worse because dang, I'm really going to miss that girl!  I suppose you have to do what's right for you, though.  No point killing yourself over a career that you're only going to hate, right?  Well, that's how I feel on the surface, anyway.  Deeper down, I've made yet another committment to myself (I think this must be committment #497) to stick with this no matter how hard and stressful it gets.  So I guess I'm just filled with a new sense of determination to kick ass at this profession and I'm renewing my "whatever it takes" attitude.  So yeah...whatever it takes.

      I'm still wondering why I'm doing this.  At first it started out as a joke between me and...hmm, I guess I should change names of people to protect the innocent...okay, a joke between me and...okay, I'll have to get back to you on the name.  But anyway, it started as a joke, but as I got to thinking, maybe this could be an interesting way for me to express myself.   So because I'm short on time, here are the things I've been thinking about this morning.  #1 - My hair.  It started falling out last semester, I assume because of stress or something.  It is odd for me to react that way to stress, but then again, I've never been under more stress in my life than I was that first semester at grad school.  Thankfully, though I guess I've adjusted because it's all growing back now.  But seriously, these bangs are out of control!!  Half my bangs are only 2 inches long, and with this humidity they have a tendency to curl.  I look so ridiculous.    #2 - Cheesecake.  Whoever invented cheesecake should have a shrine built to them somewhere where people can go and worship the glory that is that person.  I will be thankful for him/her forever!!  #3 - My psychopathology class.  This week, we're studying depression.  I've been having so many epiphanies about it lately, and at the same time I feel a little overwhelmed.  I've been reading up on the cultural influences of depression and it's interesting.  I'll probably jot down a few more thoughts on that later.  #4 - Marathons.  There is this marathon going down the road next to my apartment today.  I could never run a marathon.  I do not even come close to having the physical stamina required.  So, a salute to all marathon runners, even though I think you're nuts.   #5 - Harry Potter.  Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about Harry Potter today, probably because I just saw movie #3 the other night.  Man, that beat the pants off of #1&2.  Great flick.  Anyway, I must go worship (God, not Cheesecake-guy, although I am bringing cheesecake to church so we'll just have to see what happens about that.)  cya l8r!

      One night I had a wondrous dream,  One set of footprints there were seen,  The footprints of my precious Lord,  But mine were not along the shore.  But then some stranger prints appeared,  And I asked the Lord, "What have we here?  Those prints are large and round and neat,  But Lord, they are too big for feet."  "My child," He said in somber tones,  "For miles I carried you alone.  I challenged you to walk in faith,  But you refused and made me wait."  You disobeyed, you would not grow,  The walk of faith, you would not know,  So I got tired, I got fed up,  And there I dropped you on your butt.  Because in life, there comes a time,  When one must fight, and one must climb,  When one must rise and take a stand,  Or leave their butt prints in the sand."   --Anonymous

      I had the privilige of attending Eámanë Carnesîr's wedding over the weekend.&nbsp; It was kind of funny, because I haven't seen Eámanë in oh, 2 or so years, so I had never met her fiance (now husband) before.&nbsp; In fact, I didn't even know she was dating anyone until I got the wedding announcement.&nbsp; But anyway, by the sheerest of good luck, they were married here in San Diego and so I got to go to the ring ceremony, and the sort-of reception that took place afterwards.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, a conversation with Eámanë sparked this blog topic today.&nbsp; She was telling me about Elros's family and was saying that she had only met his parents THAT DAY.&nbsp; And that they were completely crazy, and she was worried they were going to get completely sloshed at the reception and mess it all up (I didn't stay long enough to see that happen...when I left, they were only serving Gatorade, which is really an odd wedding reception drink but at least everyone's electrolytes were balanced).&nbsp; So I got to thinking, what are some things you&nbsp;should know about your future spouse before you marry them?&nbsp; And then my brain took that a step further and started composing a letter to my own Mr.&nbsp; Right-but-apparently-not-punctual.&nbsp; Here goes:  &nbsp;  Dear (insert future pet name),  Here is just a small list of things&nbsp;you should know about me.&nbsp; First, you should know that I hate hot weather.&nbsp; I just do.&nbsp; I grew up in a land of almost perpetual winter, and believe it or not, that didn't really bother me.&nbsp; If you are from Southern California, you should know that I will only consent to live here permanently in the most extreme circumstances.&nbsp; But you should also know that if&nbsp;those circumstances happen, I'll make the best of it.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm actually a pretty resilient person that way.&nbsp; I'm good at making the best of things.&nbsp; This is probably good for you, because I'm the sort of person that gets better when things are tougher.&nbsp; I guess you could say I thrive in adversity.&nbsp; I don't know why this is.&nbsp; Maybe because it gives me an opportunity to prove myself, and I like proving myself.  &nbsp;  You should know that I find a lot of things very exciting.&nbsp; Mountains, trees, thunderstorms, good music, great books, new ideas...all that and more.&nbsp; When I get excited, I tend to shout, and people often think I'm angry about something.&nbsp; I'm not angry usually, and I try to tell them that, but a lot of people find it hard to believe me (which actually DOES make me angry).&nbsp; I guess it's because of all the shouting.&nbsp; In any case, I promise to let you know when I am angry and when I'm just excited, and to just be straightforward in general with my emotions...as long as&nbsp;you promise to believe me.&nbsp; I won't lie to you.  &nbsp;  I didn't grow up on a ranch or anything and I don't usually wear Wranglers, but sometimes I can be a bit of a cowgirl.&nbsp; There are few things in this world so satisfying to me as a well-written, well-performed country song.&nbsp; And speaking of songs, I like my car music loud.&nbsp; So loud I probably won't be able to hear you talking.&nbsp; I will be busy singing at the top of my lungs and using the steering wheel as percussion instrument.&nbsp; I love dancing, especially with men who also love dancing.&nbsp; You don't have to be good or anything, but it's nice if you can at least be exhuberant.&nbsp; Exhuberance is one of those traits I find really attractive.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  You should also know that I have a great family.&nbsp; They will do their very best to welcome you with open arms.&nbsp; I love them deeply and would do just about anything for each of them.&nbsp; I would love it if you took an interest in each of them personally, and I promise I'll make the same effort with your family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some families show love for each other through doing nice things for each other, or physical affection.&nbsp; We do this too, but one of the best ways to show love in my family is through meaningful conversation.&nbsp; I'm likely to continue this trait.&nbsp; One of the most wonderful things you can say to me is "I understand," and if you follow it up with an interesting point that I've never considered, well, you'll be happy you did.  &nbsp;  Also, patience is a virtue I don't have much of.&nbsp; I hate waiting more than almost anything in the world.&nbsp; I hate being late, and love being early.&nbsp; I also don't really like being startled or being made fun of, even good-naturedly.&nbsp; If you do happen to good-naturedly make fun of me, I will probably smile and pretend I think it's funny.&nbsp; If you make fun of me and it's NOT good-natured, I WILL make a scene.&nbsp; You don't want me to do that.&nbsp; Also, no poking, tickling, or spanking without permission.&nbsp; Seriously.  &nbsp;  I have a creative streak that I love and that I want to develop more.&nbsp; If you want to help me do this, that's really cool.&nbsp; If writing stories and music and stuff isn't really your thing, that's okay too I suppose.&nbsp; Just don't try to stop me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Don't ever, EVER make fun of Alias.  &nbsp;  I'm not that athletic.&nbsp; I'm just not.&nbsp; I try to keep myself in good shape and I like exercising, but I like doing that alone.&nbsp; I don't really enjoy watching sports, except for hockey, but if YOU want to watch sports then I will bring you chips and salsa, and maybe a steak, because I really like cooking.  &nbsp;  I have a "Canadian Girls Kick Ass" bumper sticker, which I have absolutely no intention of getting rid of, and I don't particularly care what Sister so-and-so thinks.  &nbsp;  Play with my hair and I'm yours forever.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I guess I should also tell you that I'm a very deeply spiritual person.&nbsp; In some ways, I get really annoyed with organized religion (although I hate saying that because it sounds&nbsp;so cliche).&nbsp; The fact that I am also a devout follower of an organized religion is just one of the many contradictions you'll find&nbsp;in me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I want you to be strong.&nbsp; I want to respect you.&nbsp; But the way to&nbsp;have that happen&nbsp;is simply be&nbsp;a kind, compassionate person who does his best to make the world around him a better place.&nbsp; I also want&nbsp;you to respect&nbsp;ME, but not in the tiresome and silly ways I hear so often.&nbsp; None of this "Women don't need the priesthood because they are naturally more&nbsp;spiritual" crap.&nbsp; I don't want to be put on some unreachable spiritual pedestal.&nbsp; I want to be down on the ground with you,&nbsp;getting my hands dirty with life and working as a team.&nbsp; I like life.&nbsp; I like the world.&nbsp; You'll probably find me striving to be more worldly, not less.&nbsp; This is because I believe that most people in the world are just trying to be happy, good people.&nbsp; I really want to help them do that, and I hope you do too.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, until we meet...take care.  &nbsp;  Tari Felagund

      So I went home.&nbsp; I love home.&nbsp; I love the mountains, the trees, the green, the fields of grass that wave in the wind.&nbsp; I love the way the southern Alberta sky looks, I love the smell, I love the thunderstorms.&nbsp;  &nbsp; San Diego's not a bad place either, but Calgary just...fills me.&nbsp; I remember reading this essay once in one of my undergraduate classes that lamented the fact that most of us have forgotten our sense of "generational rootedness" - our ties to our ancestors, and to the land that we are from.&nbsp; I reflected on that a bit this past week, and I've decided that I have a pretty good sense of generational rootedness. &nbsp; And yet.&nbsp; I don't understand how I can love home so much, but after a short while there I feel compelled to leave.&nbsp; The feeling used to be so disorienting, and I guess it still is and I've just come to expect it so I deal with it better.&nbsp; I've also come to realize that it's not necessarily  Calgary  that I want to leave, it's who I am when I'm there.&nbsp; I have this snapshot in my mind of the way things were when I was 17 and felt like I completely belonged, and I keep expecting everything to be the same (although not consciously).&nbsp; But I don't fit anymore.&nbsp; I've made choices that have taken me far away, and those choices have changed who I am (for the better, I like to think).&nbsp; I don't regret these choices, but&nbsp;one of the consequences is that I spend a lot of time feeling kind of alone.&nbsp; It's like John Mayer said, "Everybody is just a stranger, but that's the danger in going my own way..." &nbsp; Maybe one day I'll go back and make a new life.&nbsp; I really hope that happens, especially because I have some of the most amazing friends and family members that against all odds have managed to&nbsp;stick with me for the past few years.&nbsp; I hope that one day I can find a place where people really know me.&nbsp; Is that even possible?&nbsp; For now the only&nbsp;answer I have to that question is not yet...not yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I'm so bored. I was supposed to start my internship today, but my director called and said she wants to meet with me first so I don't just "hit the ground running." Which is probably a really good thing, but honestly, I don't know how much more I can learn about doing therapy until I actually get in there and DO it. So anyway, I'll meet with her on Monday and then I have a two-day long training up in the O.C. (haha...seriously) and then I'll probably start conducting multi-family group sessions either that week or the next.  I think I'm really nervous. No, that's not quite it. More than nervousness, I think I'm feeling an extreme drop in self-confidence lately (yeah, that's definitely it, because as soon as I typed that, my eyes started welling up). I don't know why. I think part of it is just accumulated feelings from all the events this summer, and really the whole previous year. I'm just the sort of person that needs to feel competent at something. I know that's not unusual, I'd say that most people in the world need to feel competent at something to be really happy. I think the difference for me is that for most of my life I HAVE felt extremely competent at just about everything I cared to try. And when I didn't feel like I was good at a particular activity, I either slacked off on purpose (physics) or I just quit (skiing). I hate, I HATE what that says about me.  But now, I just don't really feel good at anything. I know, I know, I'm not the type to make negatively melodramatic comments like that, so let me explain. Right now, I'm an MFT trainee. I've done very well in my course work so far at graduate school, so no problem there. But doing well in coursework doesn't mean a darn thing if you're not good at connecting with people, knowing the right thing to say to a person, being able to think on your feet, and carrying yourself in a manner that says "trust me, I know what I'm talking about." And I'm afraid of not being able to do that. Every time someone asks my opinion on some family issue or what have you, I answer them with my authoritative posturing and inside I'm thinking, "do I even have a clue what I'm talking about?"  The weird thing is, I don't think this fear is even rational to me. When I take a step back and think, I know the advice I've given is generally good, that I really do have good intuition and perception, and that I'll probably be just fine after I get some practice.  I suppose that brings me to the bottom of this problem, which is that I have a problem knowing that with hard work and practice, I'll be good at something  eventually . I want to be good at it RIGHT NOW. I really detest how that desire for immediacy has taken over so much of my life without me even realizing it. I hate looking back and seeing all of my failed attempts and missed opportunities that came simply because I couldn't handle not being perfect. But I hate even more the idea that this could keep on happening if I let it.  When I look at everything with that in mind, I think for once I've reached a point in my life where my desire to complete this program and find some way to really help people is stronger than my fear of failure. I honestly don't think I've ever confronted that before. It's terrifying, it's exciting, it's depressing. 99% of the time, I feel so discouraged. I'm not nice enough to be a therapist. I'm too opinionated. I'm too impatient. I'm too young. My manner is just all wrong. I'm not good with showing sympathy, especially if I'm not sympathetic (which, let's face it, is usually true). I have too short a fuse. I get annoyed way too easily. And on and on and on. I believe it all, but at the same time, I just don't think I have it in me to quit right now. Maybe that means I don't  really  believe it? Maybe I don't care if I'm a crappy therapist, so long as I am one?  Or maybe it means that deep down, I know I'll get better with... practice  :)  Whatever.  So there's my convoluted self-pep talk for today. Thank you, and good night.

      My hair.  It frizzes.  I have just enough natural curl to frizz, but not enough to actually look good.  And with the humidity in San Diego, there is just no way for my hair to look nice.  Hey Maranwe (psst, Kari that's you), I totally get the whole curly hair thing now.  Apologies for ever making light of it.

      Well, the long awaited day finally arrived on Saturday and my sister Celebriän married Olwë Nénharma in the Las Vegas temple. I know I should probably spend most of this entry talking about them, as it was their wedding, but it's my blog so I will focus on me and the things I learned this weekend.  This week, I learned a lot more about marriage. I learned that at its best, marriage is not just the joining of two people, but the joining of two families. I will unabashedly brag here for a moment and just say that it's a rare thing to see two families pull off a wedding as well as the Felagunds and the Nénharmas did. One of the most touching moments this weekend for me was actually at the very end, when Celebriän and Olwë had already left for their honeymoon. We had to stop over at the Nénharma's for a couple of last minute things, and before we left we all sat in their living room and had a prayer together, to thank God for the experiences and the spirit that we had all shared during the past few days. It's weird how much that meant to me, but I suspect it has to do with me feeling a little bit alone in my life right now and really needing that kind of family support system around me.  There were lots of family moments, actually. I watched my dad and my uncles laugh when remembering my grandpa. I saw the quilt my grandma gave to my sister as a wedding present, a priceless gift made with so much love. I noticed my uncle getting a little emotional when he hugged my mom in the temple. Does he realize, I wonder, how much his actions as a teenager have affected the formation of my own family? I also felt quite strongly the presence of my grandpa and grandma and even more family members at that wedding, reminding me that I owe everything I have to the efforts of those who have gone before me.  I also learned that I've never had the kind of relationship that my sister has with her husband. The way they just glowed whenever they looked at one another, the respect and love that they show each other...yeah, I've never experienced that (at least to the same degree, and if you are a former boyfriend or not-boyfriend reading this, don't get your feelings hurt, it's nothing personal). This makes me feel a little discouraged, but more than that it actually makes me feel rather hopeful. I don't totally get that, so I'll just go with it.  This weekend I learned that it's really not polite to ask the unmarried older sister if she is upset that her younger sister is getting married first. Seriously, what am I supposed to say to that? As it happens, I'm not particularly upset about it, but what if I was? There was this girl I met both at the shower and the reception that must have mentioned being 31 and not married about 50, 000, 000 times. I can bet she wouldn't have reacted particularly well to that question. It's hit and miss, you know, but why risk it? Come on people, be thoughtful.  I learned (once again) that Lamonte is just one hell of a car, but I wish her CD player wouldn't overheat so easily. Speaking of heat, I had it reconfirmed that Las Vegas is not a nice place to be in August, but I also learned that you sort of get used to it. I used to absolutely despise Las Vegas, but I don't so much anymore. So I guess I also learned that there's more to Vegas than the strip.  However, though Las Vegas has it's good points, I learned yet again that there is virtually nothing lonelier than spending the night by yourself in a Las Vegas hotel room and driving to California the next day.  This weekend, I met this person who looked directly into my eyes when he talked to me. I'd forgotten how rare that is, or how much I like it when someone does that.  I learned stuff about myself too. For instance, I think I really need to stop trying to re-create my past experience and instead focus on just having new ones. Sometimes I do that (the re-creating thing) more than is healthy. I learned that I need to be more proactive in life in general. Seems odd, doesn't it, because I know a lot of people think of me as a proactive person already. What can I say, we all have our little hidden insecurities.  Anyway, it's back to the grind for me (I'm starting my internship on Wednesday and I'm sort of freaking out), but this week was terrific. Thanks, everyone.

      There's this couple that lives below me, and every once in a while, they'll get in a huge fight.  I mean HUGE.  I've never seen them before, but the sound of their fighting somehow makes it up through my floor and into my bedroom and wakes me up in the middle of the night.  Which actually is a pretty big deal, because when I get sleeping, it's not that easy to wake me up.  I have enough morbid curiosity to put my head to the floor (or inside the water-heater closet, somehow I can hear them better in there) and listen to figure out what they're fighting about.  This is how it generally goes:  "muffle muffle muffle F*&% YOU!! muffle muffle muffle!!"  "muffle muffle blah blah YOU STUPID B*%&#!!!! blah muffle muffle!!!"  THUD!  THUD!  "MUFFLE MUFFLE F-ING SOMETHING BLAH BLAH MUFFLE!!!"  ...and so on, you get the point.  Odd how the swear-words come through loud and clear.  Anyway, I kind of wonder sometimes what I should do about this.  I can't tell with the thuds whether they're whacking each other, or just throwing things at the walls.  If they're hitting each other, I feel like maybe I should call the police or something.  In fact, my totally bizzare roommate Lúthien Silimaurë did just that one night, except that she called 911.  Typical, she is so weird.  The police, sure, but 911?  That seems excessive.   But I digress.  Or, I would be digressing if this blog entry had a point, which it doesn't.  Except maybe to say that there are fighting people downstairs and if they are going to wake me up at 3:00 am, then I wish they would at least make it more interesting for me.  Even the F-word gets boring after a while.
