0,"Her brow was clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features"
1,At length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes
2,"the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open;"
3,His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath;
4,"but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips"
5,"when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created"
6,"Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple and clock, which indicated the sixth hour"
7,"I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky"
8,The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they never change;
9,"he is very tall of his age, with sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair"
10,"I discovered more distinctly the black sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc"
11,the sky and lake are blue and placid
12,"But it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another earth, the habitations of another race of beings"
13,"“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels;"
14,"Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb;"
15,"In the midst of poverty and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground"
16,"“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth"
17,The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil
18,"“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;"
19,"“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha, and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own desire, was left alone in the cottage"
20,"“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again"
21,"We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible"
22,"and on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene"
23,"I lay at the bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger"
24,"I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance;"
25,"It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain"
26,"but everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country"
27,"Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean"
28,"He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck"
29,"As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate"
30,"Sometimes they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them;"
31,"Sometimes, indeed, I felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays, to see once more the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early childhood;"
32,"we walked for a short time on the shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines"
33,"The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber"
34,"to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever"
35,"The blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea"
36,"The snows descended on my head, and I saw the print of his huge step on the white plain"
37,How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south!
38,"There he lies, white and cold in death"
39,"The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse"
40,"I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still at my heart;"
41,"and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards"
42,"Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her"
43,"The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving"
44,"but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back;"
45,She is grown so brown and coarse!
46,I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat
47,"Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose"
48,"beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees"
49,"Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to his breakfast"
50,"He had a good leg, and was a little vain of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine texture;"
51,"His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea"
52,"When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals"
53,"A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work"
54,"It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables"
55,"as if they were buried, in deep graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them until they were dug out"
56,"As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions—as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran high"
57,"The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender—and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette"
58,"A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him flying back against the nearest wall"
59,"“And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;"
60,"The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled"
61,"The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks on the billets;"
62,"The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there"
63,"nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed;"
64,"The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine"
65,"His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to the elbows"
66,"“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death"
67,"It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people"
68,"for, with his back towards the door, and his face towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes"
69,"Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that bent low over the shoemaking"
70,"He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes"
71,"The hollowness and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really otherwise;"
72,"His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body to be withered and worn"
73,"As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him"
74,"His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white hair, which they tore in a frenzy"
75,"His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him"
76,"“Your papers, travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge, getting down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of monsieur inside, with the white head"
77,"They were consigned to me, with him, at the—” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head"
78,"They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him"
79,"and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread"
80,"Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie"
81,"It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died before him"
82,"As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun"
83,"When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become"
84,"The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis Lorry"
85,Buzzing from the blue-flies
86,"for, the crowd came pouring out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search of other carrion"
87,Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind
88,"Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was?"
89,"In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall—as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors"
90,"It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and had since improved"
91,"On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor’s table, but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor—a blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance"
92,"“Sometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied—but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and solemn—”"
93,"who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and white silk stockings"
94,"And who among the company at Monseigneur’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see the very stars out!"
95,"When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly;"
96,"He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage"
97,"All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”"
98,"The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap"
99,"to whom the mender of roads, with the aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it"
100,"“What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour"
101,"the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage"
102,The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night for three heavy hours;
103,"Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap"
104,"His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face:"
105,"Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down!"
106,"but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears"
107,"and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked"
108,the other a mender of roads in a blue cap
109,"Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank"
110,"Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret—formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes"
111,No white-haired man was there now;
112,"And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall"
113,"The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”"
114,"“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight—except on the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs"
115,"In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work"
116,"They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle"
117,"The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap:"
118,"Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull’s Eye, more lords and ladies, more Long live they all!"
119,"Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the whispering trees"
120,"Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the stone floor, and the pure water in the village well—thousands of acres of land—a whole province of France—all France itself—lay under the night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line"
121,"When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saint’s boundaries, were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:"
123,"Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression!"
124,"and it was from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown monsieur;"
125,"and he lay asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet"
126,"For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam"
127,"They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker’s white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting"
128,"Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg"
129,"If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night—and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time—"
130,"“I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, “that I should have to pass the night at Tellson’s"
131,"A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley—this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it—suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!"
132,"In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman’s"
133,"The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown"
134,"Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked around him!"
135,"Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people"
136,"As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones"
137,"The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe"
138,"Four lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all was black again"
139,"In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away"
140,"A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved!"
141,"For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted in"
142,"Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed"
143,"“Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end of his musket"
144,Listen to him!” cried the same scowling red-cap
145,"Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by a watch-fire"
146,"The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either side of him"
147,"The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women"
148,"When they had ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell"
149,"For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over the counter?"
150,"Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it"
151,"And as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their frenzied eyes;—eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun"
152,"His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone"
153,"The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again, and the sun was red on the courtyard"
154,"But, the lesser grindstone stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had never given, and would never take away"
155,the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame;
156,"bright women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey;"
157,"all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst"
158,"But, from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties"
159,"She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;"
160,"At first, they were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags;"
161,"As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer’s house, the feathery snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been"
162,"Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road"
163,"A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness"
164,but the rough red cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing
165,"Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top"
166,"In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor’s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men’s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine"
167,"All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be"
168,"“Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;"
169,"A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room"
170,"Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he stood with the lamp in his hand, as if he were a statue made to hold it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red woollen shirt, said:"
171,"It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as the rest"
172,"of the people, pipe in mouth, playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes;"
173,"of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude, like slumbering bears or dogs;"
174,"Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire—perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson’s, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago"
175,"Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over"
176,"He wore the white riding-coat and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him"
177,"Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy shoes, and trudged"
178,"The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep—whom many fell away from in dread—pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd"
179,"“That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o’clock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs"
180,"When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned"
181,"But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies"
182,"Her father’s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish"
183,"Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath—the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing her—and both highly commended it"
184,"In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited their fate"
185,"“I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up"
186,"“The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes"
187,"The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap"
188,"Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap"
189,"Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets"
190,"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her"
191,"such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;"
192,"It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other:"
193,"so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go"
194,"As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she was talking"
195,"A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!"
196,"Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely"
197,"By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:"
198,"She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else"
199,"all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her"
200,“What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice
201,"And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?” She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves"
202,"Two began in a low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;"
203,"He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections"
204,"found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which he didn't know what to make of;"
205,"using the jaw, he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor"
206,"One side of his body lifted itself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it, soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground"
207,By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it
208,"bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard;"
209,"But Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to one side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the wallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw screamed:"
210,"dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by the employees at the banking institute;"
211,his normally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his scalp
212,"These little, red apples rolled about on the floor, knocking into each other as if they had electric motors"
213,"an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped around her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest work;"
214,"He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the inflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust"
215,"It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others"
216,"Then she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John’s, and she wished we would be more careful!"
217,"There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it"
218,"It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw—not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things"
220,"They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside-down, and makes their eyes white!"
221,"For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow"
222,"And, think of it, soon the spring will come and the big blue sky!"
223,Such red cheeks like apples and roses
224,How pretty the red flowers look—
225,"As soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send you my card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the loathsome end has begun"
226,She is in an Italian costume with a large black shawl around her;
227,"he is in evening dress, and a black domino which is flying open"
228,There is a big black hat—have you never heard of hats that make you invisible?
229,There is a black cross over the name
230,"the icy, black water—the unfathomable depths—If only it were over!"
231,"which is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my reason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will be sufficient to serve four females"
232,"I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew"
233,"Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans"
234,"Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay"
235,The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house
236,"All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore"
237,We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue
238,"Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire"
239,The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged
240,"The lamplight, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms"
241,Our white girlhood was passed together there
242,"Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard"
243,"Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock"
244,Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high
245,"They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose"
246,"The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing"
247,When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes
248,"Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering"
249,"A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom"
250,"She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York"
251,” He passed his hand over the brown washrag of a back
252,I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner
253,At th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment-houses
254,"The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white"
255,"He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room"
256,The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room
257,"Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering"
258,"When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied"
259,"A massage and a wave, and a collar for the dog, and one of those cute little ashtrays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer"
260,In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars
261,"On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains"
262,"The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher"
263,A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s-egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer:
264,"Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven, and wandered around rather ill at ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train"
265,"She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses, who stopped at the foot of the steps"
266,"A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight, and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble"
267,It was gas blue with lavender beads
268,"One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song"
269,"The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets"
270,“Please come and see me… Phone book… Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard… My aunt…” She was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door
271,In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust
272,"He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden"
273,"Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town"
274,"We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds"
275,"Taking a white card from his wallet, he waved it before the man’s eyes"
276,"Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of nonolfactory money"
277,"As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl"
278,"I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut, in a disapproving way"
279,"She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night"
280,"When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before"
281,It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car
282,"An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in"
283,"A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek, and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car"
284,"I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge black knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain"
285,His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door
286,“You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock
287,Now it was again a green light on a dock
288,"The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea"
289,“I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around
290,"It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour"
291,"A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap"
292,"They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously"
294,"” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree"
295,“I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose
296,"They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between"
297,only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning
298,"Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead"
299,"… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight"
300,His heart beat faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own
301,"the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry"
302,"Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans"
303,"Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine"
304,” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck
305,“Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too
306,"On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea"
307,Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky
308,"It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it… High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl…"
309,"He felt the hot, green leather of the seat"
310,He wears a pink suit
311,"“It’s a nice yellow one,” said Wilson, as he strained at the handle"
312,"Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé"
313,"Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out… Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white"
314,"“We’re all white here,” murmured Jordan"
315,"He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead"
316,"“It was a yellow car,” he said, “big yellow car"
317,That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear?
318,“He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car
320,"I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon"
321,there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor
322,The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves
323,"He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car"
324,"Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street"
325,"His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before"
326,"Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry"
327,About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car
328,"He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen"
329,"The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before"
330,"He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off"
331,About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light
332,"The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he “had a way of finding out,” supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car"
333,"The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water"
334,"But when I’d shouted “hello” several times in vain, an argument broke out behind a partition, and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes"
335,"About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and me in the limousine, and a little later four or five servants and the postman from West Egg, in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin"
336,the Schultzes’?” and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands
337,"And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St"
338,In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress
339,So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home
340,"She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee"
341,"On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone"
342,"And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world"
343,"And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock"
344,"He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it"
345,"Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us"
346,One of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a whale in Spitzbergen that was white all over
347,"They stand in so great dread of some of them, that when out at sea they are afraid to mention even their names, and carry dung, lime-stone, juniper-wood, and some other articles of the same nature in their boats, in order to terrify and prevent their too near approach"
348,there—pointing to the sea—is a green pasture where our children’s grand-children will go for bread
349,Are the green fields gone?
350,"Further on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight"
351,A hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer;
352,"and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit"
353,"and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin"
354,"” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well"
355,"says old Dives, in his red silken wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh!"
356,Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights?
357,"But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast"
358,"Though true cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom"
359,"One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner"
360,"His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast;"
361,"So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study"
362,"“May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I rayther guess you’ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin’ his head"
363,"It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares"
364,"But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks"
365,"I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them"
366,but I never heard of a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one
367,"I am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension"
368,"Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms"
369,"Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner"
370,"a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards;"
371,"There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery"
372,Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came
373,full of fine maples—long avenues of green and gold
374,"And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses"
375,"and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit"
376,ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass;
377,What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!
378,"The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste"
379,"Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers"
380,"then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea"
381,"He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him"
382,"And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep"
383,"and the whale shoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison"
384,"and in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils"
385,"Do you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood?"
386,"We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back;"
387,"With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp"
388,"When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling;"
389,as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro
390,Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the red-men
391,"But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met where the place was:"
392,"these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard"
393,and a pair of prodigious black pots too!
394,"I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt"
395,"But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared"
396,"But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;"
397,"consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale"
398,"he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;"
399,"I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large;"
400,"Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime"
401,"that worships in Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at Queequeg"
402,"“No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face"
403,a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck
404,"spring, thou chap with the red whiskers;"
405,"spring, thou green pants"
406,"and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows"
407,"Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were heard,—"
408,good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent
409,the sail-needles are in the green locker!
410,"For, like his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face"
411,"Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers"
412,"Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main"
413,and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress
414,"So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole"
415,"So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood"
416,"For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods;"
417,"even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants;"
418,"This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine"
419,"“If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!"
420,"A white whale—did ye mark that, man?"
421,"He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them"
422,"Though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below"
423,"The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag"
424,"Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs"
425,"And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver"
426,hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals
427,“All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale
428,“Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
429,"whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”"
430,"“It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul:"
431,“a white whale
432,look sharp for white water;
433,"“Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick"
434,"“Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”"
435,"aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing;"
436,it was that accursed white whale that razed me;
437,"to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out"
438,“A sharp eye for the white whale;
439,wilt thou not chase the white whale?
440,"To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me"
441,"and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him"
442,"and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss"
443,I leave a white and turbid wake;
444,The white whale is their demigorgon
445,girls and a green!—then I’ll hop with ye;
446,) That’s a white man;
447,to think of the green navies and the green-skulled crews!
448,"Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!"
449,green the first day I brought ye thence;
450,"White skin, white liver!"
451,"But those chaps there are worse yet—they are your white squalls, they"
452,"white whale, shirr!"
453,"Here have I heard all their chat just now, and the white whale—shirr!"
454,"Oh, thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on this small black boy down here;"
455,"For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump"
456,"a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings"
457,"Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal"
458,"but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it"
459,He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down;
460,"What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted;"
461,"and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe;"
462,"and though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day;"
463,though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor;
464,"by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar;"
465,"and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord;"
466,"John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool;"
467,"Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;"
468,So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or shark
469,"As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same quality in the Polar quadruped"
470,"Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations?"
471,"the white thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns"
472,"But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!"
473,"Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale man” of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?"
474,For Lima has taken the white veil;
475,"but under precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread;"
476,he never rests till blue water is under him again
477,"But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul;"
478,"There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils;"
479,"for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black bisons of distant Oregon?"
480,"Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way?"
481,"and when we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper;"
482,"and like wilful travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him"
483,"There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place;"
484,"that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople?"
485,"For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale;"
486,"Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore"
487,"The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips"
488,"A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff"
489,"But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head"
490,"Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere"
491,"While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head, “All ready there, Fedallah?”"
492,"“Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy"
493,"“What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”"
494,Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone;
495,"As for Fedallah, who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon;"
496,"Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea"
497,"nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white rolling billows"
498,"Beach me, beach me on their black backs, boys;"
499,"see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and down on it;"
500,"Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey"
501,"The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea"
502,There’s white water again!—close to!
503,The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall
504,"the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning;"
505,on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow
506,"These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow"
507,"And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience;"
508,"for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air without any horizon"
509,"It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest"
510,"at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams;"
511,"Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck"
512,"“It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair;"
513,"while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea"
514,"But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him"
515,still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him
516,"” In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs"
517,their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint
518,while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene
519,"In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs"
520,"His jets are erect, full, and black like soot;"
521,"And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer"
522,"and to windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen"
523,"As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage"
524,"In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges"
525,"Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely feeds"
526,and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea
527,"Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else"
528,"But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm;"
529,"In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills"
530,"whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering"
531,"As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice exclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to have seen thee, thou white ghost!”"
532,"what cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman’s nooses;"
533,"An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe"
534,The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill
535,"The slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men"
536,"And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman;"
537,"At last, gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red wine, shot into the frighted air;"
538,"Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains standing"
539,"Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head"
540,"Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them;"
541,"which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh"
542,"like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter"
543,You would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods
544,"Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it"
545,The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre;
546,"The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous din"
547,"The sea-vultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled"
548,"Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it;"
549,"An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea"
550,It was a black and hooded head;
551,"He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair"
552,"A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam’s whaling voyage"
553,"“Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!"
554,a broad white shadow rose from the sea;
555,"It was sorely tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin"
556,"For now, as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side;"
557,"Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near"
558,"But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast"
559,"I’d give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much"
560,"only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece"
561,"from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins"
562,"In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles, including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips"
563,"in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner"
564,"*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw"
565,"The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent"
566,"and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves;"
567,"Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet"
568,"“Pull now, men, like fifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils"
569,Hurrah for the white-ash breeze!
570,"While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask"
571,Blinding vapors of foam and white-fire!
572,"As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into its eternal blue noon;"
573,"The next moment, relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea"
574,turned up the white secrets of his belly;
575,"Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red blood"
576,"and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory, known to seamen as Java Head;"
577,"But though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was descried"
578,"Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually rising and falling away to leeward"
579,"And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese!"
580,"It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales;"
581,"And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end;"
582,"and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm thing from its place"
583,"and when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond;"
584,"Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he is gallied"
585,"as we thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us;"
586,"The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths"
587,” Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices
588,the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour
589,"The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales"
590,and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at his side
591,it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour
592,"In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in one eccentric span"
593,"Nor smile so, while I write that this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;"
594,"So, though in the clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow;"
595,"It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day;"
596,"Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest"
598,"First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes"
599,"After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer"
600,"Here lounged the watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads"
601,"as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides;"
602,"and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon"
603,so that in the pitchiest night the ship’s black hull still houses an illumination
604,This is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil
605,"I sailed with thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I am, taught thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!"
606,"and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’s talisman"
607,the green miser’ll hoard ye soon!
608,"He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth;"
609,"“See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet"
610,"“Well, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!"
611,"But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple"
612,"and, flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was all chips"
613,"he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers;"
614,The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;
615,"Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton"
616,"The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white billiard-ball"
617,"Forward, the red flame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work"
618,He makes a fierce red flame there!
619,he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work
620,and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above
621,"where, stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well"
622,"for not only do they believe that the stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens;"
623,and so form the white breakers of the milky way
624,"till at last, Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights, some of which flew close to Ahab"
625,“For the white fiend!
626,"all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship, and mocked it!"
627,the mild blue hill-sides;
628,The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats;
629,"and drawing still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew"
630,I’ll soon take that black from your brow
631,"then, such a sweetness and such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns"
632,"and touched at each tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar"
633,"Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come"
634,"while lit up by the preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body"
635,the white flame but lights the way to the White Whale!
636,"Why, my little man, you have pretty red hair, but you couldn’t get afire now"
637,"and when she profoundly settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake"
638,"the black one with the white, for I will not let this go"
639,"I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an Emperor’s!”"
640,"and looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea"
641,"and while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward;"
642,and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water;
643,"spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man!—and a black!"
644,"Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants"
645,"What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy’s host to white men with gold lace upon their coats!—Monsieurs, have ye seen one Pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly!"
646,"now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered Moby Dick;—and now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;"
647,one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes;
648,"with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his prize"
649,"while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea"
650,"Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat;"
651,"the masoned, walled-town of a Captain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without—oh, weariness!"
652,By the green land;
653,"I think, sir, they have some such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket"
654,only black water!
655,"Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade;"
656,"and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake;"
657,"and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale’s back;"
658,Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns;
659,"Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left"
660,"and he gazed beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward"
661,"In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab’s boat;"
662,"But suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable bottom"
663,"his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea"
664,"Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows;"
665,"and breaking up the charmed circle, she effectually parted the white whale from his victim"
666,"Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine caking in his wrinkles;"
667,"So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier;"
668,"Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being"
669,"“The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin, forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”"
670,"The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the forged iron, men, the white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool!"
671,"Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake"
672,the white whale goes that way;
673,No such green weather stains on Ahab’s head!
674,"We’ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail"
675,"and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck"
676,he pecks—he tears the vane”—pointing to the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha!
677,"The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;"
678,"but in that evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship;"
679,"and the red flag, half-wrapping him as with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing heart;"
680,"Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!”"
681,"Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship’s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled"
682,"But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost touched;—at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar"
683,a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides;
684,"Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve"
685,"Till, gaining that vital centre, the black bubble upward burst;"
686,"As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession"
687,"” He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table"
688,” He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
689,"’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette"
690,"Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl"
691,"Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance"
692,"He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered"
693,"“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person"
694,"His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled"
695,"“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand"
696,"“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise"
697,"I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair"
698,"He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament"
699,A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him
700,"Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features"
701,That trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China
702,"“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column"
703,"All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible"
704,"“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man"
705,"He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;"
706,"“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply"
707,"From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement"
708,"Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked like a coster’s orange barrow"
709,"A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager"
710,"The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance"
711,He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper
712,"“‘What, the red-headed man?’"
713,Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
714,"” He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird"
715,"Three gilt balls and a brown board with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business"
716,"The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians"
717,"A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums"
718,"and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions"
719,"As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopædia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me"
720,"Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light"
721,"With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern"
722,"In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair"
723,“Your red-headed idea was very new and effective
724,"Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear"
725,"As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat"
726,"And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer"
727,"Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face"
728,"Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments"
729,"Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves"
730,"You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink"
731,"strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache;"
732,"Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots"
733,"I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland"
734,"where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap"
735,"However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him"
736,"In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard"
737,"Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern"
738,"I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel"
739,"” It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls"
740,"His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter"
741,But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost
742,and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past
743,"What can this be?’ Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate"
744,"I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter K three times repeated"
745,"We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden"
746,"There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one"
747,"The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips"
748,"“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I have felt helpless"
749,"He rummaged in his coat pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon the table"
750,"Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire"
751,"Then he lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling"
752,"Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others"
753,"He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table"
754,"There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves, was upon their track"
755,"Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room"
756,"Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search"
757,"and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the forecastle of an emigrant ship"
758,"Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes"
759,"“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns"
760,"A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by"
761,"As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists"
762,"“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself"
763,"If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade"
764,"He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs"
765,"In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features"
766,"“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is as black as a tinker’s"
767,A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
768,Gone was the coarse brown tint!
769,"A twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment"
770,"When an actor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for my skill"
771,"Then with a red head of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar"
772,"He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand"
773,"In front of him he saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder"
774,"It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear"
775,"The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured"
776,"“He is a man who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream"
777,"“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining"
778,"They all appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of lime-cream"
779,"This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of training"
780,"See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand"
781,“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated
782,", abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle"
783,"‘Found at the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat"
784,"It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red"
785,"A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes’ surmise as to his habits"
786,"His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt"
787,"Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord"
788,You see this other page in red ink?
789,"Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure"
790,A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger
791,"It was one bird, I imagine in which you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail"
792,"It laid an egg after it was dead—the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen"
793,"Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance"
794,"You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”"
795,It’s the big white one over yonder
796,"“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the flock"
797,"A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered"
798,For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor’s knee
799,"Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist"
800,” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room
801,"His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand"
802,"A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey"
803,"” He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands"
804,"He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures"
805,"The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth"
806,Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened
807,"The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided"
808,"A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window"
809,"A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand"
810,"Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers"
811,"Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head"
812,"The woman was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face"
813,"By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp"
814,"and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?"
815,"As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward"
816,” He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece
817,"As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters"
818,"It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth"
819,"The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand"
820,"“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a bride’s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water"
821,"“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air"
822,"Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell"
823,"He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers"
824,"“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair"
825,"Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a little from the road"
826,Something like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black eyes
827,"With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class"
828,"A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths"
829,"Our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet"
830,"You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation"
831,"“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe"
832,My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning
833,"He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me"
834,"It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east"
835,"All over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage"
836,"Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him"
837,"That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the road"
838,"It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones"
839,"I may tell you that, besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him through the door"
840,"“Now lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business"
841,An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
842,"There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle buried in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the ground"
843,"Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck"
844,finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth—to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines
845,"and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement"
846,"So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows"
847,"“Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there"
848,"The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained:"
849,"A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;"
850,the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it;
851,and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur
852,"and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit:"
853,"Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault"
854,Daylight began to forsake the red-room;
855,"and now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls—occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaming mirror—I began to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed;"
856,"“Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself"
857,"The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed with thick black bars"
858,"I knew quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery fire"
859,"“You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying;"
860,"“Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished”—“A great black dog behind him”—“Three loud raps on the chamber door”—“A light in the churchyard just over his grave,” &c"
861,No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red-room;
862,"“But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room"
863,"“Little darling!—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has;"
864,"I remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion;"
865,"“What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a woman?” The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug:"
866,"I shall remember how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day;"
867,"the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour’s silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position"
868,"the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds"
869,"but, as I had no appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments"
870,"they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores"
871,"in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag:"
872,"brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front;"
873,"her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet;"
874,"but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay"
875,"not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog;"
876,“The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith;
877,the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd;
878,"and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot:"
879,"“Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ——?—I cannot pronounce her name as you do"
880,"we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread"
881,Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time;
882,"A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead"
883,there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair:
884,"I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me"
885,"“My dear children,” pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, “this is a sad, a melancholy occasion;"
886,"for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the red-room:"
887,"She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well contented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure from the contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns"
888,"That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings:"
889,"sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her steps"
890,"snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies"
891,"How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!"
892,"days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration"
893,the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies;
894,"My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water;"
895,"Close by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there stood a little crib"
896,"My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks;"
897,"I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two;"
898,"it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands"
899,I saw her in a black gown and widow’s cap;
900,"I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff;"
901,"very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively complexion"
902,"an arm-chair high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron;"
903,"The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view"
904,"However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy"
905,"I looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing"
906,the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields;
907,"I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park;"
908,"It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in stained glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded"
909,"Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard"
910,"Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers;"
911,"both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans;"
912,"the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight"
913,"narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard’s castle"
914,"a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face:"
915,"and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop"
916,"pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys:"
917,"when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees"
918,"a black merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet;"
919,"and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house—from the grey hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud;"
920,"This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance"
921,"Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane"
922,"however, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk;"
923,"his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his black hair"
924,"“The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,” said I, speaking as seriously as he had done"
925,"Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water;"
926,"Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight:"
927,"a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible"
928,"Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge"
929,the large fire was all red and clear;
930,the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch;
931,"She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock;"
932,"A dress of rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn;"
933,her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals
934,"When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart’s core"
935,"and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning"
936,"There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap"
937,"This was when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief;"
938,"carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases:"
939,"Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her gloves, and her gold watch;"
940,"the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him;"
941,"Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze;"
942,"Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as grave as any judge"
943,"They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds"
944,her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well
945,"Her black satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame"
946,"The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;—but her face?"
947,"and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong!"
949,"Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet;"
950,and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called their occupants out into the grounds
951,"and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c"
952,"Within the arch, the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet:"
953,"“He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out?"
954,"no command in that blank, brown eye"
955,almost as black as a crock
956,She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet:
957,"she was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze:"
958,It looked all brown and black:
959,"elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws:"
960,"she then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke"
961,"She again put her short black pipe to her lips, and renewed her smoking with vigour"
962,"“Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then—”"
963,"and the two dowagers, in vast white wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail"
964,his black eyes darted sparks
965,"approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;"
966,"the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front, divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame;"
967,"I had, again and again, held the water to Mason’s white lips;"
968,"little birds were just twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard;"
969,"“I hope no one is dead,” I said, glancing at his black dress"
970,the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains;
971,"This was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair"
972,The hue of her dress was black too;
973,"Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide"
974,"I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked away"
975,"of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead"
976,"I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and servants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service"
977,"its blue—where blue was visible—was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin"
978,"If I dared, I’d touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!—but I’d as soon offer to take hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh"
979,"and whether she won’t look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions"
980,the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn;
981,the roads white and baked;
982,"Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of clouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven"
983,"the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?” (I had green eyes, reader;"
984,"Your eyebrows have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, ‘a blue-piled thunderloft"
985,Thank God it is no worse!” And now he unknit his black brows;
986,"for I am to take mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me"
987,"How would a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?"
988,"” We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed"
989,"he fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin"
990,"With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk"
991,"I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure"
992,"you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black satin"
993,"“And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?”"
994,"No sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to lower her blue and starry banner over the lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him, for the love of heaven, to give me a song"
995,"It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet:"
996,"“I will leave you by yourself, white dream,” I said"
997,no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day
998,it stood up black and riven:
999,you will never have green leaves more—never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs;
1000,"for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright:"
1001,"I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment"
1002,it was white and straight;
1003,I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!”
1004,the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes
1005,"the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were figments of imagination;"
1006,"I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds;"
1007,"the priest waited in his white surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him"
1008,"His eye, as I have often said, was a black eye:"
1009,An inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips
1010,"sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear"
1011,"the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet"
1012,"I recognised well that purple face,—those bloated features"
1013,Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this face with that mask—this form with that bulk;
1014,a white December storm had whirled over June;
1015,"and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway"
1016,"eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow"
1017,"I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears"
1018,"While I walked under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics kindled round me—I reasoned thus, Jane—and now listen;"
1019,"When I think of the thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles—”"
1020,I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain;
1021,"but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter"
1022,I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead;
1023,"then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward"
1024,I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside;
1025,What business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering knocker?
1026,"She shook her head, she “was sorry she could give me no information,” and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly:"
1027,"I imagine he did not think I was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his brown loaf"
1028,"Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor"
1029,"I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs"
1030,a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat
1031,Mary’s pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth:
1032,"“As white as clay or death,” was responded"
1033,My black silk frock hung against the wall
1034,"His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes;"
1035,"Mr. Rivers now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat, fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me"
1036,"“Indeed you shall stay here,” said Diana, putting her white hand on my head"
1037,"They clung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment"
1038,"the white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray;"
1039,"Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple habit, with her Amazon’s cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can scarcely be imagined:"
1040,"The massive towers, the donjon keep, The flanking walls that round them sweep, In yellow lustre shone”—"
1041,the cloak that covered his tall figure all white as a glacier
1042,"I have it here—it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white"
1043,"As I looked at his lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a good husband:"
1044,"but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation:"
1045,there I found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye
1046,"The thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his own"
1047,"As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom:"
1048,"his eye was a cold, bright, blue gem;"
1049,"“Down superstition!” I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the black yew at the gate"
1050,"I had set out from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face"
1051,"She was a big woman, and had long black hair:"
1052,so dank and green were its decaying walls
1053,"I passed my finger over his eyebrows, and remarked that they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make them grow as broad and black as ever"
1054,“Just to comb out this shaggy black mane
1055,I described to him how brilliantly green they were;
1056,how sparklingly blue was the sky
1057,"“His appearance,—I forget what description you gave of his appearance;—a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?”"
1058,"tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile"
1059,"he is present to your imagination,—tall, fair, blue-eyed, and with a Grecian profile"
1062,"What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest!"
1063,"Was he born in what the Radical papers call the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy?"
1064,"I was in a hand-bag—a somewhat large, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary hand-bag in fact"
1066,"Because you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily"
1067,"He is dressed in the deepest mourning, with crape hatband and black gloves"
1068,"Kneels at table, opens box, and produces letters tied up with blue ribbon"
1069,Enter Jack with a hand-bag of black leather in his hand
1070,"I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty"
1071,"They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other, and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there were petticoats under them"
1072,"The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass nails"
1073,"They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches"
1074,"” She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door"
1075,"I dined on what they called “robber steak”—bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat’s meat!"
1076,"I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard"
1077,"Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the road"
1078,and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals
1079,"In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the “Mittel Land” ran the road, losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame"
1080,Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves
1081,"Right and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range, deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where the snowy peaks rose grandly"
1082,"Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water"
1083,"for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves"
1084,"The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud"
1085,"We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle"
1086,"They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us"
1087,"I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red in the lamplight, as he turned to us"
1088,"” As he spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory"
1089,"It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall, so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket"
1090,"Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame"
1091,"He went rapidly to where the blue flame arose—it must have been very faint, for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all—and gathering a few stones, formed them into some device"
1092,"Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle"
1093,"but just then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues, with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair"
1094,"Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky"
1095,"Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour about him anywhere"
1096,"The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth;"
1097,"Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine;"
1098,"Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames"
1099,"He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year—last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway—a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed"
1100,"As far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm"
1101,"He grew excited as he spoke, and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength"
1102,"They were all of the thinnest foreign post, and looking at them, then at him, and noticing his quiet smile, with the sharp, canine teeth lying over the red underlip, I understood as well as if he had spoken that I should be careful what I wrote, for he would be able to read it"
1103,"I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day"
1104,"The windows were curtainless, and the yellow moonlight, flooding in through the diamond panes, enabled one to see even colours, whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth"
1105,"Two were dark, and had high aquiline noses, like the Count, and great dark, piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon"
1106,All three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips
1107,"I felt in my heart a wicked, burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips"
1108,"There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth"
1109,"As my eyes opened involuntarily I saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant’s power draw it back, the blue eyes transformed with fury, the white teeth champing with rage, and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion"
1110,"The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them"
1111,the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white-hot metal
1112,the lips were as red as ever
1113,"their red jaws, with champing teeth, and their blunt-clawed feet as they leaped, came in through the opening door"
1114,"with a red light of triumph in his eyes, and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of"
1115,"There lay the Count, but looking as if his youth had been half renewed, for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron-grey;"
1116,"the cheeks were fuller, and the white skin seemed ruby-red underneath;"
1117,"I sympathise with poor Desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear, even by a black man"
1118,"The houses of the old town—the side away from us—are all red-roofed, and seem piled up one over the other anyhow, like the pictures we see of Nuremberg"
1119,there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows
1120,Lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock;
1121,To my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey
1122,"Everything is grey—except the green grass, which seems like emerald amongst it;"
1123,"Before the sun dipped below the black mass of Kettleness, standing boldly athwart the western sky, its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset-colour—flame, purple, pink, green, violet, and all the tints of gold;"
1124,"Some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest—the sea, running mountains high, threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam, which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space;"
1125,now and again the white wings of a storm-tossed sea-bird
1126,"It almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water, and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage"
1127,to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object
1128,"I ran along the North Terrace, but could see no sign of the white figure which I expected"
1129,"but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone, and bent over it"
1130,"When I got almost to the top I could see the seat and the white figure, for I was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow"
1131,"There was undoubtedly something, long and black, bending over the half-reclining white figure"
1132,"Lucy!” and something raised a head, and from where I was I could see a white face and red, gleaming eyes"
1133,"I must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it, for there are two little red points like pin-pricks, and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood"
1134,"the red light was thrown over on the East Cliff and the old abbey, and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow"
1135,“His red eyes again!
1136,The red sunlight was shining on the windows of St
1137,They are like little white dots with red centres
1138,"Then I had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes, just as we saw in the sunset, and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once;"
1139,"and then I seemed sinking into deep green water, and there was a singing in my ears, as I have heard there is to drowning men;"
1140,As I got through the belt of trees I saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house
1141,"When the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband—oh, Lucy, it is the first time I have written the words ‘my husband’—left me alone with my husband, I took the book from under his pillow, and wrapped it up in white paper, and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck, and sealed it over the knot with sealing-wax, and for my seal I used my wedding ring"
1142,"I reached him just as the sun was going down, and from his window saw the red disc sink"
1143,"“My friend John, when the corn is grown, even before it has ripened—while the milk of its mother-earth is in him, and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold, the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands, and blow away the green chaff, and say to you:"
1144,"the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently;"
1145,"As he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat, buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her, was dragged a little up, and showed a red mark on her throat"
1146,The velvet band again covered the red mark
1147,"There was no sign of disease, but the edges were white and worn-looking, as if by some trituration"
1148,"There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon, lay poor Lucy, more horribly white and wan-looking than ever"
1149,"He wetted the poor white lips with it, and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart"
1150,"He opened it with much impressment—assumed, of course—and showed a great bundle of white flowers"
1151,"There wasn’t much people about that day, and close at hand was only one man, a tall, thin chap, with a ’ook nose and a pointed beard, with a few white hairs runnin’ through it"
1152,"He had a ’ard, cold look and red eyes, and I took a sort of mislike to him, for it seemed as if it was ’im as they was hirritated at"
1153,"He ’ad white kid gloves on ’is ’ands, and he pointed out the animiles to me and says:"
1154,"My eye, won’t some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes a-shining at her out of the dark!"
1155,"The air seems full of specks, floating and circling in the draught from the window, and the lights burn blue and dim"
1156,"With white faces and trembling hands, we opened the door gently, and entered the room"
1157,"The latter lay farthest in, and she was covered with a white sheet, the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window, showing the drawn, white face, with a look of terror fixed upon it"
1158,"By her side lay Lucy, with face white and still more drawn"
1159,"The flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother’s bosom, and her throat was bare, showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before, but looking horribly white and mangled"
1160,"When he arrived it was nearly six o’clock, and the sun was setting full and warm, and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks"
1161,"“So here we are, installed in this beautiful old house, and from both my bedroom and the drawing-room I can see the great elms of the cathedral close, with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and I can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day, after the manner of rooks—and humans"
1162,"Very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness, and putting out her poor, pale, thin hand, took Van Helsing’s great brown one;"
1163,"There was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers, and death was made as little repulsive as might be"
1164,"He was very pale, and his eyes seemed bulging out as, half in terror and half in amazement, he gazed at a tall, thin man, with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard, who was also observing the pretty girl"
1165,"it was hard, and cruel, and sensual, and his big white teeth, that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red, were pointed like an animal’s"
1166,I could see Van Helsing’s face grow white and purple by turns
1167,"and those holy men, with the white garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time their eyes never on the page;"
1168,"Big, dark blue eyes are set widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man’s moods"
1169,"how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that it is hot, flit down on them, and then—and then in the morning are found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?”"
1170,"Holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he made assurance of Lucy’s coffin"
1171,"Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb;"
1172,"I heard the rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child"
1173,"“Are you convinced now?” said the Professor in response, and as he spoke he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth"
1174,"if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week, after she die—if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard, and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe?"
1175,"He, poor fellow, must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him;"
1176,Arthur looked up with set white face and said:—
1177,"We then waited, and saw something white come through the trees"
1178,"how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city"
1179,"First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin;"
1180,"and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advance—a dim white figure, which held something dark at its breast"
1181,and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again
1182,It was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes
1183,"Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a long leather one, something like a cricketing bag;"
1184,"First he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame;"
1185,"Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could see its dint in the white flesh"
1186,"and a hideous, blood-curdling screech came from the opened red lips"
1187,"the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam"
1188,"Then noticing my red eyes, he went on:"
1189,"Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to see the high lights of the Count’s evil face, the ridge of the nose, the red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor"
1190,"All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own"
1191,"so that a thin streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own"
1192,"The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room"
1193,") The mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like smoke—or with the white energy of boiling water—pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of the door"
1194,"It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye"
1195,"But the pillar was composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me;"
1196,"till, as I looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St"
1197,"Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became black darkness"
1198,The last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist
1199,"“Well, guv’nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built"
1200,"Curse me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an’ him a old feller, with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn’t throw a shadder"
1201,"All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away"
1202,He was laughing with his red mouth;
1203,"the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees, to where the dogs were barking"
1204,"all red blood, with years of life in it;"
1205,"‘All these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall down and worship me!’ And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes;"
1206,"He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no one"
1207,"There was a red cloud before me, and a noise like thunder, and the mist seemed to steal away under the door"
1208,The moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see
1209,Kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the white-clad figure of his wife
1210,"Her white nightdress was smeared with blood, and a thin stream trickled down the man’s bare breast which was shown by his torn-open dress"
1211,His eyes flamed red with devilish passion;
1212,the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge;
1213,"and the white sharp teeth, behind the full lips of the blood-dripping mouth, champed together like those of a wild beast"
1214,"The moonlight suddenly failed, as a great black cloud sailed across the sky;"
1215,"Then she put before her face her poor crushed hands, which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the Count’s terrible grip, and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief"
1216,"When she raised it, his white night-robe was stained with blood where her lips had touched, and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops"
1217,"It interested me, even at that moment, to see, that, whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head, the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair"
1218,"All the manuscript had been burned, and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes;"
1219,There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed
1220,"the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line;"
1221,"the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between;"
1222,and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St
1223,"I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him"
1224,"but over his face, as the awful narrative went on, came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light, till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up, the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair"
1225,"” The poor dear grew white as death, and shock and shivered, as I have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide"
1226,"As he had placed the Wafer on Mina’s forehead, it had seared it—had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white-hot metal"
1227,"And oh, Madam Mina, my dear, my dear, may we who love you be there to see, when that red scar, the sign of God’s knowledge of what has been, shall pass away, and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know"
1228,"If it may be that with all the others we can be so successful, then the sunset of this evening may shine on Madam Mina’s forehead all white as ivory and with no stain!”"
1229,"Last night he was a frank, happy-looking man, with strong, youthful face, full of energy, and with dark brown hair"
1230,"To-day he is a drawn, haggard old man, whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief-written lines of his face"
1231,"His waxen hue became greenish-yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes, and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound"
1232,"and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband, and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested, she listened bravely and with calmness"
1233,"of that sweet, sweet, good, good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation, with the red scar on her forehead, of which she was conscious, and which we saw with grinding of our teeth—remembering whence and how it came;"
1234,"Oh, God, let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered, who all his life has done no wrong, and on whom so many sorrows have come"
1235,"I thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face, but somehow now I think it has a deeper meaning"
1236,"A red streak shot up, and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room"
1237,as friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock!
1238,In the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darling’s white forehead
1239,"He swear much, and he red face and loud of voice, but he good fellow all the same;"
1240,"Final the captain, more red than ever, and in more tongues tell him that he doesn’t want no Frenchmen—with bloom upon them and also with blood—in his ship—with blood on her also"
1241,for I caught sight in the mirror of the red mark upon my forehead;
1242,It was only when I caught sight of the red blotch on Mrs. Harker’s forehead that I was brought back to reality
1243,though to me all happiness for her was denied by the red scar on her forehead
1244,"” She paused, and the red sun shot up"
1245,"It is now not far off sunset time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood, so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep"
1246,"None safer in all the world from them than I am,” and as I wondered at the meaning of her words, a puff of wind made the flame leap up, and I see the red scar on her forehead"
1247,"I knew the swaying round forms, the bright hard eyes, the white teeth, the ruddy colour, the voluptuous lips"
1248,And so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snow-gloom
1249,"and far off, beyond the white waste of snow, I could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way"
1250,"He was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which I knew too well"
1251,"The Castle of Dracula now stood out against the red sky, and every stone of its broken battlements was articulated against the light of the setting sun"
1252,"The sun was now right down upon the mountain top, and the red gleams fell upon my face, so that it was bathed in rosy light"
1253,"The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn"
1254,"Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette"
1255,"In the grass, white daisies were tremulous"
1256,"Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examined it"
1257,"“I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk, “and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible"
1258,"A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings"
1259,"With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized"
1260,"I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room, the most astounding details"
1261,"“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky"
1262,Lord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane
1263,"There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows"
1264,"“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a funny look of penitence"
1265,"Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair"
1266,The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now
1267,"In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars"
1268,"Two green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing"
1269,I am no more to you than a green bronze figure
1270,"Who is he?” asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy white eyebrows"
1271,"And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face"
1272,"Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us"
1273,"Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides"
1274,"Some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in London"
1275,"I don’t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares"
1276,"Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose"
1277,"She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat"
1278,"She lives with her mother, a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she had seen better days"
1279,"“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have been to the opera with you several times,” said Dorian, opening his blue eyes in wonder"
1280,Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks
1281,"He was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eyes—that it was through certain words of his, musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her"
1282,"He was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses"

1323,"On a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley, his guardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled"
1324,A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye
1325,And it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil

1331,"He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the “panis cælestis,” the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins"

1480,"There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck"
1481,"come, black with sin!"
1482,"They had white domestic awnings in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts"
1483,"They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill, and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and used considerable many cuss words"
1484,"Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted"
1485,"they warn’t nothing else but mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places, and two or three inches deep in all the places"
1486,"he was over fifty year old, and had a very red face"
1487,"He cussed away with all his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray hair a-flying"
1488,"One long, lanky man, with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t’other and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane;"
1489,"So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them up all over the village"
1490,and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their’n
1491,"He dressed Jim up in King Lear’s outfit—it was a long curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers;"
1492,"but now, when he’d take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that you’d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old Leviticus himself"
1493,"You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed one;"
1494,"Mary Jane was red-headed, but that don’t make no difference, she was most awful beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so glad her uncles was come"
1495,"and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said so—said “How do you get biscuits to brown so nice?” and “Where, for the land’s sake, did you get these amaz’n pickles?” and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know"
1496,"When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no more sound than a cat"
1497,"It’s jest a small, thin, blue arrow—that’s what it is;"
1498,"All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out:"
1499,"You hain’t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark"
1500,"We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards"
1501,"So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate"
1502,"big double log-house for the white folks—hewed logs, with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another;"
1503,"And here comes the white woman running from the house, about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her hand;"
1504,"and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same way the little niggers was doing"
1505,"He turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection"
1506,Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line;
1507,"Jim he couldn’t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him;"
1508,"And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn’t hardly wait for the blessing;"
1509,"My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder"
1510,"But it’s gone, that’s the long and the short of it, and you’ll just have to change to a red flann’l one till I can get time to make a new one"
1511,"and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:"
1512,"I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he’d say what he did say—so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor"
1513,"So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a brown study;"
1514,"And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep"
1515,"So he now doubled himself up and perched on the low curb surrounding the monument, while the little girl and the big black dog dropped easily down beside him"
1516,With a toss of her yellow locks she pointed her forefinger westward
1517,The dog replied by dropping his black head from Bonny-Gay’s shoulder to the ground and by blinking in a deprecating way from that lowly position
1518,"In a few minutes she had gotten the whole sad story from her old friend, the gardener, and her sunny head had gone down upon the dog’s black one in a paroxysm of grief"
1519,With that he walked briskly away and Bonny-Gay saw him enter the big gray house in the middle of the Place
1520,"She need look no more, to either right or left, for the blue-shirted figure, which had been wont to wave a salutation to her as she passed with her brood of nurselings"
1521,how soft and rich and brown the earth did look!
1522,the Gray Gentleman had sent his elderly black “boy” with a note to the vine-covered house in Mt
1523,the dark eyes as beautiful as the blue ones;
1524,"for with a whisk to the stove she had seized a coarse brown teapot and poured from it a hot draught into a cup that had no handle, indeed, yet could serve as well as another to refresh an exhausted creature"
1525,"But there was Mary Jane herself just as the carriage door was closing, thrusting something white and feather-trimmed into the pale lady’s lap"
1526,"There sat a great black dog beside her, so close that he almost forced her crutch away"
1527,"To see her little white hands hold it up to her lips and see her just nibble, nibble—Why, mother Bump!"
1528,"Only Max remained undisturbed, even nestled the closer to the blue-shirted man, who in some manner reminded him of his old master, Mr. Weems"
1529,"At the door he paused, cast one miserable glance over the little room and his face was very white beneath its stains of toil and weather"
1530,By the time they returned Mary Jane’s eyes were no longer red and there was nothing out of common in her manner
1531,"She had exchanged her blue gingham for her pink print, had dusted off the shoes which, alas!"
1532,"Standing upon her crutches before the tiny looking-glass, hung at an angle above the mantel, she adjusted and readjusted the pretty leghorn, until she had placed it as nearly in the position it had occupied on Bonny-Gay’s yellow curls as she could"
1533,"Right in the very business part of the city the car stopped and he came back to her, thrusting a pale green slip of paper into her hand, and hurriedly lifting her out"
1534,This time it was a yellow slip Mary Jane received and again she was set down in the midst of a confusing crowd
1535,and will this yellow ticket pay my way?”
1536,The green house I call it;
1537,"It seemed like the passage of some bird, so swift she was and so unerring, for before even the most watchful of the nurses could intervene she had entered the darkened chamber and crossed to a white cot in the middle of it"
1538,"Bonny-Gay lay, shorn of her beautiful curls, almost as white as her pillows"
1539,for at that cheerful reply she opened her blue eyes and looked into the eager face so near them
1540,"A gray-haired man appeared at the doorway, took one long, delighted look at the small figure on the cot, barely seeing the other child beside it, and went away again"
1541,The white-capped woman smiled back and silently held forward a plate on which was some carefully cut up food
1542,The two white-capped women exchanged glances
1543,The gray-haired father had come into the room and bent beside his wife over the cot where lay their one darling child;
1544,"Mary Jane had never seen such brilliancy as this, and again she forgot herself in studying her surroundings and enjoying the vivid green of the grass and shrubs"
1545,"So she hopped nimbly over the velvet lawn to where the flowers gleamed scarlet and white and wonderful, and bending above them thrust her face deep down into their loveliness"
1546,"and his blue uniform represented to Mary Jane’s mind an all-powerful guardian, to whom appeal was never made in vain"
1547,"And how simple and kind was this gray-haired father, who didn’t look half so strong as her own absent one, but who talked so fast and asked so many questions that, before she at all realized what she was doing, the cripple had given him their whole family history"
1548,and she wondered at the slowness of the one colored “boy”—as gray as his master—who answered that master’s ring
1549,"Then William Bump arose, put on his hat, whistled to a big black dog who lay on the doorstep and started off for his afternoon of loafing"
1550,"She did not see the Gray Gentleman, who had come into the park awhile before and having caught sight of his favorite’s pink frock, crossed the level space from the “Playgrounds” to the embankment to see what so interested her"
1551,"The fallow fields of the McClure estate no longer lie idle under the blue sky, a reproach to their owner"
1552,"its floor is strewn with gray sand, in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse;"
1553,"Doubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed Puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins, that, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk of the family tree, with so much venerable moss upon it, should have borne, as its topmost bough, an idler like myself"
1554,“What is he?” murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to the other
1555,"a gray-headed shipmaster, in each generation, retiring from the quarter-deck to the homestead, while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast, confronting the salt spray and the gale, which had blustered against his sire and grandsire"
1556,"According to the received code in such matters, it would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, to bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine"
1557,"it is, with both, a gleam that plays upon the surface, and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch, and gray, mouldering trunk"
1558,"Then, moreover, the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair"
1559,"With his florid cheek, his compact figure, smartly arrayed in a bright-buttoned blue coat, his brisk and vigorous step, and his hale and hearty aspect, altogether he seemed—not young, indeed—but a kind of new contrivance of Mother Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no business to touch"
1560,"To observe and define his character, however, under such disadvantages, was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view of its gray and broken ruins"
1561,"but, rather, a deep, red glow, as of iron in a furnace"
1562,"The Custom-House marker imprinted it, with a stencil and black paint, on pepper-bags, and baskets of anatto, and cigar-boxes, and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise, in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost, and gone regularly through the office"
1563,"glancing at such matters with the saddened, weary, half-reluctant interest which we bestow on the corpse of dead activity,—and exerting my fancy, sluggish with little use, to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old town’s brighter aspect, when India was a new region, and only Salem knew the way thither,—I chanced to lay my hand on a small package, carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment"
1564,"There was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity, and made me undo the faded red tape, that tied up the package, with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light"
1565,"But the object that most drew my attention, in the mysterious package, was a certain affair of fine red cloth, much worn and faded"
1566,"While thus perplexed,—and cogitating, among other hypotheses, whether the letter might not have been one of those decorations which the white men used to contrive, in order to take the eyes of Indians,—I happened to place it on my breast"
1567,"and as if the letter were not of red cloth, but red-hot iron"
1568,"Moonlight, in a familiar room, falling so white upon the carpet, and showing all its figures so distinctly,—making every object so minutely visible, yet so unlike a morning or noontide visibility,—is a medium the most suitable for a romance-writer to get acquainted with his illusive guests"
1569,"Glancing at the looking-glass, we behold—deep within its haunted verge—the smouldering glow of the half-extinguished anthracite, the white moonbeams on the floor, and a repetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture, with one remove further from the actual, and nearer to the imaginative"
1570,"To confess the truth, it was my greatest apprehension,—as it would never be a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself, and it being hardly in the nature of a public officer to resign,—it was my chief trouble, therefore, that I was likely to grow gray and decrepit in the Surveyorship, and become much such another animal as the old Inspector"
1571,"white-headed and wrinkled images, which my fancy used to sport with, and has now flung aside forever"
1572,"Before this ugly edifice, and between it and the wheel-track of the street, was a grass-plot, much overgrown with burdock, pigweed, apple-peru, and such unsightly vegetation, which evidently found something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilized society, a prison"
1573,"It might be, that an Antinomian, a Quaker, or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the town, or an idle and vagrant Indian, whom the white man’s fire-water had made riotous about the streets, was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest"
1574,"The door of the jail being flung open from within, there appeared, in the first place, like a black shadow emerging into sunshine, the grim and grisly presence of the town-beadle, with a sword by his side, and his staff of office in his hand"
1575,"because its existence, heretofore, had brought it acquainted only with the gray twilight of a dungeon, or other darksome apartment of the prison"
1576,"On the breast of her gown, in fine red cloth, surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold-thread, appeared the letter A"
1577,"She had dark and abundant hair, so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam, and a face which, besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion, had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes"
1578,"and as for the red letter, which she hath stitched so curiously, I’ll bestow a rag of mine own rheumatic flannel, to make a fitter one!”"
1579,"a decayed house of gray stone, with a poverty-stricken aspect, but retaining a half-obliterated shield of arms over the portal, in token of antique gentility"
1580,"She saw her father’s face, with its bald brow, and reverend white beard, that flowed over the old-fashioned Elizabethan ruff;"
1581,"Next rose before her, in memory’s picture-gallery, the intricate and narrow thoroughfares, the tall, gray houses, the huge cathedrals, and the public edifices, ancient in date and quaint in architecture, of a Continental city;"
1582,"a new life, but feeding itself on time-worn materials, like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall"
1583,"but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the English settlements, that one of them would have attracted any notice from Hester Prynne, at such a time;"
1584,"By the Indian’s side, and evidently sustaining a companionship with him, stood a white man, clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage costume"
1585,"He wore a dark feather in his hat, a border of embroidery on his cloak, and a black velvet tunic beneath;"
1586,"while his gray eyes, accustomed to the shaded light of his study, were winking, like those of Hester’s infant, in the unadulterated sunshine"
1587,"Even if I imagine a scheme of vengeance, what could I do better for my object than to let thee live,—than to give thee medicines against all harm and peril of life,—so that this burning shame may still blaze upon thy bosom?” As he spoke, he laid his long forefinger on the scarlet letter, which forthwith seemed to scorch into Hester’s breast, as if it had been red-hot"
1588,"But it is not recorded that, in a single instance, her skill was called in aid to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride"
1589,"Sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb, as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate, the model of piety and justice, to whom that age of antique reverence looked up, as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels"
1590,"They averred, that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but was red-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen glowing all alight, whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the night-time"
1591,"and, however white and clear originally, they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold, the fiery lustre, the black shadow, and the untempered light of the intervening substance"
1592,"Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility;"
1593,"The pine-trees, aged, black and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as Puritan elders;"
1594,"and, suddenly,—for women in solitude, and with troubled hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions,—she fancied that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but another face, in the small black mirror of Pearl’s eye"
1595,"At last, her shot being all expended, the child stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little, laughing image of a fiend peeping out—or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it—from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes"
1596,The mother herself—as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form—had carefully wrought out the similitude;
1597,"The serf wore the blue coat, which was the customary garb of serving-men of that period, and long before, in the old hereditary halls of England"
1598,"all, and especially the helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance, and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor"
1599,"Pearl, seeing the rose-bushes, began to cry for a red rose, and would not be pacified"
1600,"The wide circumference of an elaborate ruff, beneath his gray beard, in the antiquated fashion of King James’s reign, caused his head to look not a little like that of John the Baptist in a charger"
1601,"This creed was never taught, for instance, by the venerable pastor, John Wilson, whose beard, white as a snow-drift, was seen over Governor Bellingham’s shoulder;"
1602,"while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches might yet be naturalized in the New England climate, and that purple grapes might possibly be compelled to nourish, against the sunny garden-wall"
1603,"“I can teach my little Pearl what I have learned from this!” answered Hester Prynne, laying her finger on the red token"
1604,"This fantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the Governor’s red roses, as Pearl stood outside of the window;"
1605,"Hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child, so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom?”"
1606,"who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters, often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art"
1607,"Sometimes, a light glimmered out of the physician’s eyes, burning blue and ominous, like the reflection of a furnace, or, let us say, like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from Bunyan’s awful doorway in the hillside, and quivered on the pilgrim’s face"
1608,"since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin, that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart, to make manifest an unspoken crime?”"
1609,"Or,—can we not suppose it?—guilty as they may be, retaining, nevertheless, a zeal for God’s glory and man’s welfare, they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men;"
1610,"“Thus, a sickness,” continued Roger Chillingworth, going on, in an unaltered tone, without heeding the interruption,—but standing up, and confronting the emaciated and white-cheeked minister, with his low, dark, and misshapen figure,—“a sickness, a sore place, if we may so call it, in your spirit, hath immediately its appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame"
1611,"It came to pass, not long after the scene above recorded, that the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale, at noonday, and entirely unawares, fell into a deep, deep slumber, sitting in his chair, with a large black-letter volume open before him on the table"
1612,"Roger Chillingworth, however, was inclined to be hardly, if at all, less satisfied with the aspect of affairs, which Providence—using the avenger and his victim for its own purposes, and, perchance, pardoning where it seemed most to punish—had substituted for his black devices"
1613,"While thus suffering under bodily disease, and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul, and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy, the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office"
1614,"The virgins of his church grew pale around him, victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it to be all religion, and brought it openly, in their white bosoms, as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar"
1615,"“I, whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthood,—I, who ascend the sacred desk, and turn my pale face heavenward, taking upon myself to hold communion, in your behalf, with the Most High Omniscience,—I, in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of Enoch,—I, whose footsteps, as you suppose, leave a gleam along my earthly track, whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blest,—I, who have laid the hand of baptism upon your children,—I, who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends, to whom the Amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quitted,—I, your pastor, whom you so reverence and trust, am utterly a pollution and a lie!”"
1616,"More than once, he had cleared his throat, and drawn in the long, deep, and tremulous breath, which, when sent forth again, would come burdened with the black secret of his soul"
1617,"Alas, if he discern such sinfulness in his own white soul, what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine!” The minister well knew—subtle, but remorseful hypocrite that he was!—the light in which his vague confession would be viewed"
1618,"Now came the dead friends of his youth, and his white-bearded father, with a saint-like frown, and his mother, turning her face away as she passed by"
1619,"The same platform or scaffold, black and weather-stained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years, and foot-worn, too, with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it, remained standing beneath the balcony of the meeting-house"
1620,"If the same multitude which had stood as eye-witnesses while Hester Prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth, they would have discerned no face above the platform, nor hardly the outline of a human shape, in the dark gray of the midnight"
1621,"At one of the chamber-windows of Governor Bellingham’s mansion, which stood at some distance, on the line of another street, he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself, with a lamp in his hand, a white night-cap on his head, and a long white gown enveloping his figure"
1622,"Hither, likewise, would come the elders and deacons of Mr. Dimmesdale’s church, and the young virgins who so idolized their minister, and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms;"
1623,"Whom would they discern there, with the red eastern light upon his brow?"
1624,"the garden-plots, black with freshly turned earth;"
1625,"the wheel-track, little worn, and, even in the market-place, margined with green on either side;—all were visible, but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they had ever borne before"
1626,"We impute it, therefore, solely to the disease in his own eye and heart, that the minister, looking upward to the zenith, beheld there the appearance of an immense letter,—the letter A,—marked out in lines of dull red light"
1627,"But, as he came down the pulpit steps, the gray-bearded sexton met him, holding up a black glove, which the minister recognized as his own"
1628,"“But did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last night?—a great red letter in the sky,—the letter A, which we interpret to stand for Angel"
1629,"“It is our Hester,—the town’s own Hester, who is so kind to the poor, so helpful to the sick, so comfortable to the afflicted!” Then, it is true, the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself, when embodied in the person of another, would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of bygone years"
1630,"All the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this red-hot brand, and had long ago fallen away, leaving a bare and harsh outline, which might have been repulsive, had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it"
1631,"So the child flew away like a bird, and, making bare her small white feet, went pattering along the moist margin of the sea"
1632,"Come thou into the pool!” And Pearl, stepping in, mid-leg deep, beheld her own white feet at the bottom;"
1633,"Ever and anon, too, there came a glare of red light out of his eyes;"
1634,"Nor do I,—whom the scarlet letter has disciplined to truth, though it be the truth of red-hot iron, entering into the soul,—nor do I perceive such advantage in his living any longer a life of ghastly emptiness, that I shall stoop to implore thy mercy"
1635,Let the black flower blossom as it may!
1636,"His gray beard almost touched the ground, as he crept onward"
1637,"Then she took up the white foam, that streaked the line of the advancing tide, and threw it upon the breeze, scampering after it, with winged footsteps, to catch the great snow-flakes ere they fell"
1638,"One little gray bird, with a white breast, Pearl was almost sure, had been hit by a pebble, and fluttered away with a broken wing"
1639,"“My little Pearl,” said Hester, after a moment’s silence, “the green letter, and on thy childish bosom, has no purport"
1640,"but, though there was that singular expression which she had so often remarked in her black eyes, she could not satisfy herself whether Pearl really attached any meaning to the symbol"
1641,"Two or three times, as her mother and she went homeward, and as often at supper-time, and while Hester was putting her to bed, and once after she seemed to be fairly asleep, Pearl looked up, with mischief gleaming in her black eyes"
1642,"This hemmed it in so narrowly, and stood so black and dense on either side, and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above, that, to Hester’s mind, it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering"
1643,"Overhead was a gray expanse of cloud, slightly stirred, however, by a breeze;"
1644,"And, mother, the old dame said that this scarlet letter was the Black Man’s mark on thee, and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him at midnight, here in the dark wood"
1645,"The trees impending over it had flung down great branches, from time to time, which choked up the current and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points;"
1646,"Letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream, they could catch the reflected light from its water, at some short distance within the forest, but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of tree-trunks and underbrush, and here and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens"
1647,"Throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice, he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees, clad in garments so sombre, and so little relieved from the gray twilight into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide, that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow"
1648,"Canst thou deem it, Hester, a consolation, that I must stand up in my pulpit, and meet so many eyes turned upward to my face, as if the light of heaven were beaming from it!—must see my flock hungry for the truth, and listening to my words as if a tongue of Pentecost were speaking!—and then look inward, and discern the black reality of what they idolize?"
1649,"until, some few miles hence, the yellow leaves will show no vestige of the white man’s tread"
1650,"Be, if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission, the teacher and apostle of the red men"
1651,"All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst the sunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure forest, gladdening each green leaf, transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold, and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees"
1652,"The great black forest—stern as it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into its bosom—became the playmate of the lonely infant, as well as it knew how"
1653,"It offered her the partridge-berries, the growth of the preceding autumn, but ripening only in the spring, and now red as drops of blood upon the withered leaves"
1654,and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her
1655,"But there was Hester, clad in her gray robe, still standing beside the tree-trunk, which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago, and which time had ever since been covering with moss, so that these two fated ones, with earth’s heaviest burden on them, might there sit down together, and find a single hour’s rest and solace"
1656,"As she drew nigh, the arch-fiend whispered him to condense into small compass and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon, and bear black fruit betimes"
1657,"having on a high head-dress, a rich gown of velvet, and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch, of which Ann Turner, her especial friend, had taught her the secret, before this last good lady had been hanged for Sir Thomas Overbury’s murder"
1658,"“Have I then sold myself,” thought the minister, “to the fiend whom, if men say true, this yellow-starched and velveted old hag has chosen for her prince and master!”"
1659,"He knew that it was himself, the thin and white-cheeked minister, who had done and suffered these things, and written thus far into the Election Sermon!"
1660,"The minister stood, white and speechless, with one hand on the Hebrew Scriptures, and the other spread upon his breast"
1661,"On this public holiday, as on all other occasions, for seven years past, Hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth"
1662,"for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green before a village meeting-house, than the centre of a town’s business"
1663,"But we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge, which undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age"
1664,"The picture of human life in the market-place, though its general tint was the sad gray, brown, or black of the English emigrants, was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue"
1665,"A party of Indians—in their savage finery of curiously embroidered deer-skin robes, wampum-belts, red and yellow ochre, and feathers, and armed with the bow and arrow and stone-headed spear—stood apart, with countenances of inflexible gravity, beyond what even the Puritan aspect could attain"
1666,"Thus, the Puritan elders, in their black cloaks, starched bands, and steeple-crowned hats, smiled not unbenignantly at the clamor and rude deportment of these jolly seafaring men;"
1667,"In that old day, the English settler on these rude shores—having left king, nobles, and all degrees of awful rank behind, while still the faculty and necessity of reverence were strong in him—bestowed it on the white hair and venerable brow of age;"
1668,and it glows like a red flame in the dark
1669,"“Then tell her,” rejoined he, “that I spake again with the black-a-visaged, hump-shouldered old doctor, and he engages to bring his friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him"
1670,"Even the Indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white man’s curiosity, and, gliding through the crowd, fastened their snake-like black eyes on Hester’s bosom;"
1671,"He tells you, that, with all its mysterious horror, it is but the shadow of what he bears on his own breast, and that even this, his own red stigma, is no more than the type of what has seared his inmost heart!"
1672,"By sending yonder dark and terrible old man, to keep the torture always at red-heat!"
1673,"Near this latter spot, one afternoon, some children were at play, when they beheld a tall woman, in a gray robe, approach the cottage-door"
1674,"In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits"
1675,"He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol"
1676,"And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men"
1677,"Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each other—then separating slowly or hastily"
1678,It had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery—a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over
1679,"Yes, two black hens"
1680,"Therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people watched him, thunderstruck, till some man—I was told the chief’s son—in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab with a spear at the white man—and of course it went quite easy between the shoulder-blades"
1681,"Two women, one fat and the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool"
1682,"There was a vast amount of red—good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer"
1683,"A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a compassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary"
1684,In the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly
1685,"She wore a starched white affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose"
1686,"Often far away there I thought of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the unknown, the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes"
1687,Old knitter of black wool
1688,"The edge of a colossal jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist"
1689,"Here and there greyish-whitish specks showed up clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above them perhaps"
1690,It was paddled by black fellows
1691,You could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening
1692,"a small flame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech—and nothing happened"
1693,"A lot of people, mostly black and naked, moved about like ants"
1694,"A horn tooted to the right, and I saw the black people run"
1695,"Six black men advanced in a file, toiling up the path"
1696,"He had a uniform jacket with one button off, and seeing a white man on the path, hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity"
1697,"This was simple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who I might be"
1698,"these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed and drove men—men, I tell you"
1699,"They were not enemies, they were not criminals, they were nothing earthly now—nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish gloom"
1700,"The black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant, a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out slowly"
1701,He had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck—Why?
1702,"It looked startling round his black neck, this bit of white thread from beyond the seas"
1703,"When near the buildings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort of vision"
1704,"I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots"
1705,"Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand"
1706,"Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform, camping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very hospitable and festive—not to say drunk"
1707,"I had a white companion, too, not a bad chap, but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade and water"
1708,"One of them, a stout, excitable chap with black moustaches, informed me with great volubility and many digressions, as soon as I told him who I was, that my steamer was at the bottom of the river"
1709,"When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special house had to be built"
1710,"He allowed his ‘boy’—an overfed young negro from the coast—to treat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence"
1711,there were shiny patches on the black creek
1712,"He was a lank, bony, yellow-faced man, with big intense eyes"
1713,"at work, when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose"
1714,"It came in sections during the next three weeks, each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the impressed pilgrims"
1715,"a lot of tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white cases, brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard, and the air of mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station"
1716,"the dugout, four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home—perhaps;"
1717,"It was so startling that I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as though I had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of confidence"
1718,"Sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange—had the appearance of being held there captive by a spell"
1719,"But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage"
1720,The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy
1721,I had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes—I tell you
1722,"A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and flapped sadly in our faces"
1723,but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago
1724,"but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which looked clean yet"
1725,"When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the night"
1726,"We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it—all perfectly still—and then the white shutter came down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves"
1727,"What is the meaning—’ stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims—a little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore sidespring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks"
1728,"It was very curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away"
1729,"Don’t you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity?"
1730,"An athletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor predecessor, was the helmsman"
1731,"He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the world of himself"
1732,"I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the doorway"
1733,"Only in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably sombre, brooding, and menacing expression"
1734,Perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black Sahara
1735,"Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business"
1736,The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that at least this poor Kurtz had been properly avenged
1737,the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar;
1738,"The river-bank was clear, and on the waterside I saw a white man under a hat like a cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm"
1739,"His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright patches, blue, red, and yellow—patches on the back, patches on the front, patches on elbows, on knees;"
1740,"A beardless, boyish face, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a wind-swept plain"
1741,"’ He opened his arms wide, staring at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round"
1742,"I returned deliberately to the first I had seen—and there it was, black, dried, sunken, with closed eyelids—a head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line of the teeth, was smiling, too, smiling continuously at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber"
1743,"There was a low jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of fringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her"
1744,"‘He suspected there was an active ill-will towards him on the part of these white men that—’ ‘You are right,’ I said, remembering a certain conversation I had overheard"
1745,‘I have a canoe and three black fellows waiting not very far
1746,"but deep within the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed the exact position of the camp where Mr. Kurtz’s adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil"
1747,"a dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which black things stood very still"
1748,"A black figure stood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the glow"
1749,"I steamed up a bit, then swung down stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping, fierce river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air"
1750,"In front of the first rank, along the river, three men, plastered with bright red earth from head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly"
1751,"they shook towards the fierce river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent tail—something that looked a dried gourd;"
1752,"The three red chaps had fallen flat, face down on the shore, as though they had been shot dead"
1753,"“The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us down towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress;"
1754,"Suddenly the manager’s boy put his insolent black head in the doorway, and said in a tone of scathing contempt:"
1755,"I shall see this eloquent phantom as long as I live, and I shall see her, too, a tragic and familiar Shade, resembling in this gesture another one, tragic also, and bedecked with powerless charms, stretching bare brown arms over the glitter of the infernal stream, the stream of darkness"
1756,"The offing was barred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast sky—seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness"
1757,"The shape of the letters on my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair"
1758,"As I saw him go, picking his way among the nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in"
1759,"The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped to look after him;"
1760,and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed
1761,On the edge of the river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright;
1762,"Joe was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites"
1763,"My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap"
1764,"After that, he sat feeling his right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times"
1765,"but he found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread and butter on the other"
1766,"As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with grey, I got up and went downstairs;"
1767,"Stop him!” The cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes, and steaming out of their nostrils, “Halloa, young thief!” One black ox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved round, that I blubbered out to him, “I couldn’t help it, sir!"
1768,"He sees the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore, closing in round him"
1769,"In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage, which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other"
1770,"And now, when they were all in lively anticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account, poor wretches"
1771,"Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain, though all of a watery lead colour"
1772,"“Didn’t I tell you,” said the other convict then, “that he would murder me, if he could?” And any one could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes, like thin snow"
1773,I could see nothing else but black darkness
1774,"By the light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark"
1775,"“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what a scholar you are!"
1776,"In time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a purple leptic fit"
1777,Joe’s blue eyes turned a little watery;
1778,"It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew keenly, and the frost was white and hard"
1779,"and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom"
1780,"And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was white"
1781,"But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow"
1782,"Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair"
1783,"not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then"
1784,"She had her back towards me, and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never looked round, and passed out of my view directly"
1785,"A figure all in yellow white, with but one shoe to the feet;"
1786,"“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach"
1787,"Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another—as they well might—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”"
1788,"“Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out at the coach-window"
1789,"Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence;"
1790,"Why sure you don’t mean to say, Pip, that there was no black welwet co—eh?” For, I stood shaking my head"
1791,"‘Good Lord!’ says he, ‘Camilla, what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black?’ So like Matthew!"
1792,"He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but stood up bristling"
1793,"He had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them"
1794,"and, as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community"
1795,"But the black beetles took no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not on terms with one another"
1796,“I am yellow skin and bone
1797,"she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered;"
1798,the once white cloth all yellow and withered;
1799,"Never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window, and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair"
1800,"The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again, looking up at me out of a black eye"
1801,"What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black night-sky, and Joe’s furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road"
1802,"Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms?"
1803,"Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach;"
1804,"Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the business,—such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,—not but what they would have been attended to, don’t you see?”"
1805,"indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed;"
1806,"The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a church,—and with people hanging over the pews looking on,—and with mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading the newspapers,—and with some shining black portraits on the walls, which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking-plaster"
1807,"Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about everybody’s private affairs) that he was the man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going"
1808,"There may be black ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved;"
1809,"I was haunted by the fear that she would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me"
1810,"Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havisham’s would seem to show me Estella’s face in the fire, with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,—often at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last"
1811,"When I went to Lunnon town sirs, Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul Wasn’t I done very brown sirs?"
1812,"Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella;"
1813,"and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the same"
1814,"When I was very small and timid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner of the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well:"
1815,"The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot bar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body, whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,—as if it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,—and finally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he again leaned on his hammer,—"
1816,"The Constables and the Bow Street men from London—for, this happened in the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house for a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases"
1817,"Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, “Such a fine figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!” Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy;"
1818,"So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew older, it stood still"
1819,"I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder, I checked off again in detail his large head, his dark complexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand"
1820,"As I passed the church, I felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds"
1821,"won’t his manners do then?” asked Biddy, plucking a black-currant leaf"
1822,"Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and the smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have you never considered that he may be proud?”"
1823,her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow
1824,"Mr. Jaggers’s own high-backed chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin;"
1825,"So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison"
1826,"” There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggers is for him, ’Melia, and what more could you have?” There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;"
1827,"My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot"
1828,"We all three went to it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap"
1829,"This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery, which was painted over"
1830,"“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face;"
1831,"When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?” And she looked up from her book, and said, “Yes"
1832,"” She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water?"
1833,"I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket’s falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the baby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers"
1834,"Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,—"
1835,"” In the room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair (his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt me anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration, as if he had been trying his art on himself"
1836,"In a back room, a high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’s own use"
1837,"there’s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who wouldn’t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it was red hot, if inveigled into touching it"
1838,"Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and repair to the battery"
1839,"So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor"
1840,"For, after I had made the monster (out of the refuse of my washerwoman’s family), and had clothed him with a blue coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat;"
1841,"“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel"
1842,"Still more, when his mourning ’at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off, try to keep it on how you may"
1843,But we didn’t find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors;
1845,"In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed stairs,—again heard the gruff “Give way, you!” like and order to dogs,—again saw the wicked Noah’s Ark lying out on the black water"
1846,"and its seared red brick walls, blocked windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich attractive mystery, of which I was the hero"
1847,"At the end of the passage, while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me"
1848,"Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant lady whom I had never seen"
1849,"As my eyes followed her white hand, again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me"
1850,"If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance"
1851,"We had stopped near the centre of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth"
1852,"Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green and yellow friend"
1853,"Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I beheld Trabb’s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag"
1854,"His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb’s with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait"
1855,"He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, “Don’t know yah!” Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb’s boy, when passing abreast of me, he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his attendants, “Don’t know yah, don’t know yah, ’pon my soul don’t know yah!” The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country"
1856,"consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance"
1857,"Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s have supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping"
1858,"On his taking the recorders,—very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,—he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia"
1859,"Mr. Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike, the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, “Look out!"
1860,"Here’s the undertaker a coming, to see how you’re a getting on with your work!” I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it, without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;"
1861,"but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment, “Wai-ter!” The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification"
1862,"with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office"
1863,"The last Hamlet as I dressed, made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out “I don’t see no wafers!” And at night his reading was lovely"
1864,"Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of the bars, and put his hand to his hat—which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose military salute"
1865,"Upon that, he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he couldn’t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous article, considering the hole’s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet, and somebody’s pattens"
1866,"A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—sounded gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering out to receive Estella"
1867,"As we got more and more into debt, breakfast became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not unwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,” I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet,—so that he was actually in the air, like a booted Cupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll"
1868,” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border
1869,"Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door;"
1870,"Here, Mr. Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity of black pins"
1871,"At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;"
1872,"Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room;"
1873,"Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly here and there, and was very helpful"
1874,"Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my attention"
1875,"The remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy and his comrade"
1876,"While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property, and see how the island looked in wintertime"
1877,"but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her"
1878,"This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect"
1879,"and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain"
1880,"He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hands"
1881,"He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with his heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf"
1882,"When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness"
1883,"Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner"
1884,"As he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the breast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head"
1885,"“How long?” said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping his jaw as he stared at me"
1886,"“Dear boy,” he returned, “there’s disguising wigs can be bought for money, and there’s hair powder, and spectacles, and black clothes,—shorts and what not"
1887,"“And even then, dear boy,” said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of his pocket, “we’ll have him on his oath"
1888,"To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to state what I never quite established;"
1889,"“It’s all right, dear boy!” said Provis coming forward, with his little clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert"
1890,"He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head, when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative"
1891,"She’s all in white,’ he says, ‘wi’ white flowers in her hair, and she’s awful mad, and she’s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she says she’ll put it on me at five in the morning"
1892,"Him and me was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own book,—this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade on"
1893,"“Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done—which ’ud take a week—I’ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave"
1894,"“When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked, wi’ his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked"
1895,"And when it come to speech-making, warn’t it Compeyson as could speak to ’em wi’ his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket-handkercher,—ah!"
1896,"The black-hole of that ship warn’t a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive"
1897,"After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—at first, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention"
1898,"and, as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs from the market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying by for next summer"
1899,"It came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about;"
1900,"Previous to placing it before him, he went into the Aged’s room with a clean white cloth, and tied the same under the old gentleman’s chin, and propped him up, and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air"
1901,"Two mutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper"
1902,"But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly, silently, and surely, to take him"
1903,"And Herbert had seen him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells"
1904,"the whole population of Portsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody else’s, and sing “Fill, fill!” A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn’t fill, or do anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly stated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties;"
1905,"which was so effectually done (the Swab family having considerable political influence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he couldn’t confute with what he had overheard"
1906,"The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner"
1907,"“And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre, and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes, with the torchlight shining on their faces,—I am particular about that,—with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us?”"
1908,"” So I changed my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered, serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall"
1909,"There were none there, and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck"
1910,To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame
1911,"What have I done!” She wrung her hands, and crushed her white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again"
1912,"and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or why we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us"
1913,"for, they had covered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her"
1914,"“It would turn a man’s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it, sir,” said the landlord"
1915,"Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon"
1916,"The lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and left, and no workmen were visible"
1917,"The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter"
1918,"I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and breathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue point of the match;"
1919,"Presently I saw his blue lips again, breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and showed me Orlick"
1920,"He had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot"
1921,"My rapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with him in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapour creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved"
1922,"The white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now"
1923,"He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas bag;"
1924,"and the last green barge, straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed;"
1925,"and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud"
1926,"There was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black;"
1927,"Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me"
1928,"The blessed darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book, and hasn’t a notion about her grandpapa"
1929,"As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions"
1930,"That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white"
1931,"It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and put the cover on again"
1932,"Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green"
1933,"As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would subside again"
1934,"Do what he would, and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling"
1935,"The change, though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me"
1936,"The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and his head dropped quietly on his breast"
1937,Joe’s eyes were red when I next found him beside me;
1938,"The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave the case a black look"
1939,"The sky was blue, the larks were soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet"
1940,"But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe’s hammer"
1941,"The limes were there, and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen;"
1942,"But the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be in use, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window was open and gay with flowers"
1943,"The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin"
1944,"The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white ceiling, which had passed away"
1945,"“I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps"
1946,"every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that sawbones turn sick and white with the desire to kill him"
1947,"And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies"
1948,"and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black sneering coolness—frightened too, I could see that—but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan"
1949,"and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your fellows who do what they call good"
1950,"This was a hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner"
1951,"black secrets, by the look of him;"
1952,"And as she so sat she became aware of an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the lane;"
1953,"and the next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings"
1954,"From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a green cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire;"
1955,"At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize;"
1956,"Poole, who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief"
1957,"for his face was white and his voice, when he spoke, harsh and broken"
1958,"while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door"
1959,"The footman came at the summons, very white and nervous"
1960,"the blow shook the building, and the red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges"
1961,"At one table, there were traces of chemical work, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass saucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been prevented"
1962,and when I opened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour
1963,"He thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red tincture and added one of the powders"
1964,"and as I looked there came, I thought, a change—he seemed to swell—his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter—and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to shield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror"
1965,"The night however, was far gone into the morning—the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the conception of the day—the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber;"
1966,"it was large, firm, white and comely"
1967,"But the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corded, knuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair"
1968,"At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble;"
1969,"The city clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air"
1970,"Wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle;"
1971,"The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blindman’s-buff"
1972,"The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold"
1973,"He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step"
1974,"Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white as if with age;"
1975,It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand;
1976,"They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell hanging in it"
1977,"“Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head;"
1978,"The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection!"
1979,"Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam"
1980,"It was clothed in one simple green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur"
1981,Its dark brown curls were long and free;
1982,"Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly"
1983,"The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;"
1984,"and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water"
1985,"There were ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe"
1986,"there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner"
1987,"a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course—and in truth it was something very like it in that house"
1988,"Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness"
1989,"Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship"
1990,"especially Topper, who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it"
1991,"It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand"
1992,"“What has he done with his money?” asked a red-faced gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock"
1993,"“Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,” said the first speaker, “for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch"
1994,It would have done you good to see how green a place it is
1995,Herein lie buried many things which if read with patience may show the strange meaning of being black here at the dawning of the Twentieth Century
1996,"Venturing now into deeper detail, I have in two chapters studied the struggles of the massed millions of the black peasantry, and in another have sought to make clear the present relations of the sons of master and man"
1997,"Leaving, then, the white world, I have stepped within the Veil, raising it that you may view faintly its deeper recesses,—the meaning of its religion, the passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater souls"
1998,"Before each chapter, as now printed, stands a bar of the Sorrow Songs,—some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from black souls in the dark past"
1999,"I held all beyond it in common contempt, and lived above it in a region of blue sky and great wandering shadows"
2000,With other black boys the strife was not so fiercely sunny:
2001,"walls strait and stubborn to the whitest, but relentlessly narrow, tall, and unscalable to sons of night who must plod darkly on in resignation, or beat unavailing palms against the stone, or steadily, half hopelessly, watch the streak of blue above"
2002,"He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world"
2003,"Through history, the powers of single black men flash here and there like falling stars, and die sometimes before the world has rightly gauged their brightness"
2004,"Here in America, in the few days since Emancipation, the black man’s turning hither and thither in hesitant and doubtful striving has often made his very strength to lose effectiveness, to seem like absence of power, like weakness"
2005,"The double-aimed struggle of the black artisan—on the one hand to escape white contempt for a nation of mere hewers of wood and drawers of water, and on the other hand to plough and nail and dig for a poverty-stricken horde—could only result in making him a poor craftsman, for he had but half a heart in either cause"
2006,"The would-be black savant was confronted by the paradox that the knowledge his people needed was a twice-told tale to his white neighbors, while the knowledge which would teach the white world was Greek to his own flesh and blood"
2007,The innate love of harmony and beauty that set the ruder souls of his people a-dancing and a-singing raised but confusion and doubt in the soul of the black artist;
2008,A million black men started with renewed zeal to vote themselves into the kingdom
2009,"the curiosity, born of compulsory ignorance, to know and test the power of the cabalistic letters of the white man, the longing to know"
2010,"The red stain of bastardy, which two centuries of systematic legal defilement of Negro women had stamped upon his race, meant not only the loss of ancient African chastity, but also the hereditary weight of a mass of corruption from white adulterers, threatening almost the obliteration of the Negro home"
2011,"while sociologists gleefully count his bastards and his prostitutes, the very soul of the toiling, sweating black man is darkened by the shadow of a vast despair"
2012,"before that personal disrespect and mockery, the ridicule and systematic humiliation, the distortion of fact and wanton license of fancy, the cynical ignoring of the better and the boisterous welcoming of the worse, the all-pervading desire to inculcate disdain for everything black, from Toussaint to the devil,—before this there rises a sickening despair that would disarm and discourage any nation save that black host to whom “discouragement” is an unwritten word"
2013,"Away with the black man’s ballot, by force or fraud,—and behold the suicide of a race!"
2014,"and, all in all, we black men seem the sole oasis of simple faith and reverence in a dusty desert of dollars and smartness"
2015,"And now what I have briefly sketched in large outline let me on coming pages tell again in many ways, with loving emphasis and deeper detail, that men may listen to the striving in the souls of black folk"
2016,"They came at night, when the flickering camp-fires shone like vast unsteady stars along the black horizon:"
2017,"old men and thin, with gray and tufted hair;"
2018,"some of the black refugees declared themselves freemen, others showed that their masters had deserted them, and still others were captured with forts and plantations"
2019,"In Washington the military governor, at the urgent appeal of the superintendent, opened confiscated estates to the cultivation of the fugitives, and there in the shadow of the dome gathered black farm villages"
2020,"The systems of control, thus started, rapidly grew, here and there, into strange little governments, like that of General Banks in Louisiana, with its ninety thousand black subjects, its fifty thousand guided laborers, and its annual budget of one hundred thousand dollars and more"
2021,"In South Carolina was General Saxton, with his deep interest in black folk"
2022,"Here at a stroke of the pen was erected a government of millions of men,—and not ordinary men either, but black men emasculated by a peculiarly complete system of slavery, centuries old;"
2023,"Bereaved now of a father, now of a brother, now of more than these, they came seeking a life work in planting New England schoolhouses among the white and black of the South"
2024,"He had emerged from slavery,—not the worst slavery in the world, not a slavery that made all life unbearable, rather a slavery that had here and there something of kindliness, fidelity, and happiness,—but withal slavery, which, so far as human aspiration and desert were concerned, classed the black man and the ox together"
2025,"And the Negro knew full well that, whatever their deeper convictions may have been, Southern men had fought with desperate energy to perpetuate this slavery under which the black masses, with half-articulate thought, had writhed and shivered"
2026,So the cleft between the white and black South grew
2027,"Amid it all, two figures ever stand to typify that day to coming ages,—the one, a gray-haired gentleman, whose fathers had quit themselves like men, whose sons lay in nameless graves;"
2028,"who stood at last, in the evening of life, a blighted, ruined form, with hate in his eyes;—and the other, a form hovering dark and mother-like, her awful face black with the mists of centuries, had aforetime quailed at that white master’s command, had bent in love over the cradles of his sons and daughters, and closed in death the sunken eyes of his wife,—aye, too, at his behest had laid herself low to his lust, and borne a tawny man-child to the world, only to see her dark boy’s limbs scattered to the winds by midnight marauders riding after “damned Niggers"
2029,"First, thirty thousand black men were transported from the refuges and relief stations back to the farms, back to the critical trial of a new way of working"
2030,"abandoned lands were leased so long as they remained in the hands of the Bureau, and a total revenue of nearly half a million dollars derived from black tenants"
2031,"but the nature of its other activities and the character of its personnel prejudiced the Bureau in favor of the black litigants, and led without doubt to much injustice and annoyance"
2032,"for some fifteen million dollars, beside the sums spent before , and the dole of benevolent societies, this Bureau set going a system of free labor, established a beginning of peasant proprietorship, secured the recognition of black freedmen before courts of law, and founded the free common school in the South"
2033,"Its successes were the result of hard work, supplemented by the aid of philanthropists and the eager striving of black men"
2034,"With the prestige of the government back of it, and a directing board of unusual respectability and national reputation, this banking institution had made a remarkable start in the development of that thrift among black folk which slavery had kept them from knowing"
2035,"and they were summed up by Senator Davis, of Kentucky, when he moved to entitle the act of a bill “to promote strife and conflict between the white and black races… by a grant of unconstitutional power"
2036,"for, argued this opportunist, if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with white votes, we certainly can with black votes"
2037,"else every sensible man, black and white, would easily have chosen the latter"
2038,"there was scarcely a white man in the South who did not honestly regard Emancipation as a crime, and its practical nullification as a duty"
2039,"In such a situation, the granting of the ballot to the black man was a necessity, the very least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race, and the only method of compelling the South to accept the results of the war"
2040,"in well-nigh the whole rural South the black farmers are peons, bound by law and custom to an economic slavery, from which the only escape is death or the penitentiary"
2041,To gain the sympathy and cooperation of the various elements comprising the white South was Mr. Washington’s first task;
2042,"and this, at the time Tuskegee was founded, seemed, for a black man, well-nigh impossible"
2043,"And so thoroughly did he learn the speech and thought of triumphant commercialism, and the ideals of material prosperity, that the picture of a lone black boy poring over a French grammar amid the weeds and dirt of a neglected home soon seemed to him the acme of absurdities"
2044,"The liberalizing tendencies of the latter half of the eighteenth century brought, along with kindlier relations between black and white, thoughts of ultimate adjustment and assimilation"
2045,"In Philadelphia and New York color-prescription led to a withdrawal of Negro communicants from white churches and the formation of a peculiar socio-religious institution among the Negroes known as the African Church,—an organization still living and controlling in its various branches over a million of men"
2046,"For a time Price arose as a new leader, destined, it seemed, not to give up, but to re-state the old ideals in a form less repugnant to the white South"
2047,"Mr. Washington distinctly asks that black people give up, at least for the present, three things,—"
2048,"they hate the white South blindly and distrust the white race generally, and so far as they agree on definite action, think that the Negro’s only hope lies in emigration beyond the borders of the United States"
2049,"they do not ask that ignorant black men vote when ignorant whites are debarred, or that any reasonable restrictions in the suffrage should not be applied;"
2050,This group of men honor Mr. Washington for his attitude of conciliation toward the white South;
2051,"that, on the contrary, Negroes must insist continually, in season and out of season, that voting is necessary to modern manhood, that color discrimination is barbarism, and that black boys need education as well as white boys"
2052,"but if that reconciliation is to be marked by the industrial slavery and civic death of those same black men, with permanent legislation into a position of inferiority, then those black men, if they are really men, are called upon by every consideration of patriotism and loyalty to oppose such a course by all civilized methods, even though such opposition involves disagreement with Mr. Booker T"
2053,"We have no right to sit silently by while the inevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our children, black and white"
2054,"First, it is the duty of black men to judge the South discriminatingly"
2055,"Discriminating and broad-minded criticism is what the South needs,—needs it for the sake of her own white sons and daughters, and for the insurance of robust, healthy mental and moral development"
2056,while the passions of the ignorant are easily aroused to lynch and abuse any black man
2057,"but to use the same breath in praising Governor Aycock, exposing Senator Morgan, arguing with Mr. Thomas Nelson Page, and denouncing Senator Ben Tillman, is not only sane, but the imperative duty of thinking black men"
2058,"second, industrial and common-school training were necessarily slow in planting because they had to await the black teachers trained by higher institutions,—it being extremely doubtful if any essentially different development was possible, and certainly a Tuskegee was unthinkable before ;"
2059,"The black men of America have a duty to perform, a duty stern and delicate,—a forward movement to oppose a part of the work of their greatest leader"
2060,"” So I walked on and on—horses were too expensive—until I had wandered beyond railways, beyond stage lines, to a land of “varmints” and rattlesnakes, where the coming of a stranger was an event, and men lived and died in the shadow of one blue hill"
2061,"Next morning I crossed the tall round hill, lingered to look at the blue and yellow mountains stretching toward the Carolinas, then plunged into the wood, and came out at Josie’s home"
2062,I remember the day I rode horseback out to the commissioner’s house with a pleasant young white fellow who wanted the white school
2063,"There were the Dowells from their farm over toward Alexandria,—Fanny, with her smooth black face and wondering eyes;"
2064,"Martha, brown and dull;"
2065,"There were the Burkes,—two brown and yellow lads, and a tiny haughty-eyed girl"
2066,"There they sat, nearly thirty of them, on the rough benches, their faces shading from a pale cream to a deep brown, the little feet bare and swinging, the eyes full of expectation, with here and there a twinkle of mischief, and the hands grasping Webster’s blue-black spelling-book"
2067,"The front room was full of great fat white beds, scrupulously neat;"
2068,"and, finally, how “mean” some of the white folks were"
2069,"As I lingered there in the joy and pain of meeting old school-friends, there swept over me a sudden longing to pass again beyond the blue hill, and to see the homes and the school of other days, and to learn how life had gone with my school-children;"
2070,"Josie was dead, and the gray-haired mother said simply, “We’ve had a heap of trouble since you’ve been away"
2071,O black boy of Atlanta!
2072,They are rising—all are rising— The black and white together
2073,she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of Georgia;
2074,"then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys, the tinkle of bell and scream of whistle broke the silence, the rattle and roar of busy life slowly gathered and swelled, until the seething whirl of the city seemed a strange thing in a sleepy land"
2075,"to feel the pang of the conquered, and yet know that with all the Bad that fell on one black day, something was vanquished that deserved to live, something killed that in justice had not dared to die;"
2076,"and that future held aloft vistas of purple and gold:—Atlanta, Queen of the cotton kingdom;"
2077,"what wings must Atalanta have to flit over all this hollow and hill, through sour wood and sullen water, and by the red waste of sun-baked clay!"
2078,"wealth to employ the black serfs, and the prospect of wealth to keep them working;"
2079,To-day the ferment of his striving toward self-realization is to the strife of the white world like a wheel within a wheel:
2080,neither the black preacher nor the black teacher leads as he did two decades ago
2081,"Here stands this black young Atalanta, girding herself for the race that must be run;"
2082,"What if to the Mammonism of America be added the rising Mammonism of the re-born South, and the Mammonism of this South be reinforced by the budding Mammonism of its half-wakened black millions?"
2083,The beauty of the group lies in its simple unity:—a broad lawn of green rising from the red street and mingled roses and peaches;
2084,"In winter’s twilight, when the red sun glows, I can see the dark figures pass between the halls to the music of the night-bell"
2085,"the determination to realize for men, both black and white, the broadest possibilities of life, to seek the better and the best, to spread with their own hands the Gospel of Sacrifice,—all this is the burden of their talk and dream"
2086,"Here, amid a wide desert of caste and proscription, amid the heart-hurting slights and jars and vagaries of a deep race-dislike, lies this green oasis, where hot anger cools, and the bitterness of disappointment is sweetened by the springs and breezes of Parnassus;"
2087,"They forgot, too, just as their successors are forgetting, the rule of inequality:—that of the million black youth, some were fitted to know and some to dig;"
2088,"And if this is the white South’s need and danger, how much heavier the danger and need of the freedmen’s sons!"
2089,"Why not here, and perhaps elsewhere, plant deeply and for all time centres of learning and living, colleges that yearly would send into the life of the South a few white men and a few black men of broad culture, catholic tolerance, and trained ability, joining their hands to other hands, and giving to this squabble of the Races a decent and dignified peace?"
2090,And they say that yon gray mist is the tunic of Atalanta pausing over her golden apples
2091,"” To be sure, behind this thought lurks the afterthought of force and dominion,—the making of brown men to delve when the temptation of beads and red calico cloys"
2092,"And last of all there trickles down that third and darker thought,—the thought of the things themselves, the confused, half-conscious mutter of men who are black and whitened, crying “Liberty, Freedom, Opportunity—vouchsafe to us, O boastful World, the chance of living men!” To be sure, behind the thought lurks the afterthought,—suppose, after all, the World is right and we are less than men?"
2093,"the inferiority of black men, even if forced by fraud;"
2094,but what training for the profitable living together of black men and white?
2095,"At the same time the white South, by reason of its sudden conversion from the slavery ideal, by so much the more became set and strengthened in its racial prejudice, and crystallized it into harsh law and harsher custom;"
2096,while the marvellous pushing forward of the poor white daily threatened to take even bread and butter from the mouths of the heavily handicapped sons of the freedmen
2097,"From the very first in nearly all the schools some attention had been given to training in handiwork, but now was this training first raised to a dignity that brought it in direct touch with the South’s magnificent industrial development, and given an emphasis which reminded black folk that before the Temple of Knowledge swing the Gates of Toil"
2098,"Yet after all they are but gates, and when turning our eyes from the temporary and the contingent in the Negro problem to the broader question of the permanent uplifting and civilization of black men in America, we have a right to inquire, as this enthusiasm for material advancement mounts to its height, if after all the industrial school is the final and sufficient answer in the training of the Negro race;"
2099,"Race-prejudices, which keep brown and black men in their “places,” we are coming to regard as useful allies with such a theory, no matter how much they may dull the ambition and sicken the hearts of struggling human beings"
2100,"And above all, we daily hear that an education that encourages aspiration, that sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character rather than bread-winning, is the privilege of white men and the danger and delusion of black"
2101,The white teachers who flocked South went to establish such a common-school system
2102,"At that time it was the sudden volcanic rupture of nearly all relations between black and white, in work and government and family life"
2103,in a single generation they put thirty thousand black teachers in the South;
2104,"they wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black people of the land, and they made Tuskegee possible"
2105,"and above all, to furnish the black world with adequate standards of human culture and lofty ideals of life"
2106,Among white Southerners this feeling is widespread and positive
2107,"It was not and is not money these seething millions want, but love and sympathy, the pulse of hearts beating with red blood;—a gift which to-day only their own kindred and race can bring to the masses, but which once saintly souls brought to their favored children in the crusade of the sixties, that finest thing in American history, and one of the few things untainted by sordid greed and cheap vainglory"
2108,Colored college-bred men have worked side by side with white college graduates at Hampton;
2109,"If white people need colleges to furnish teachers, ministers, lawyers, and doctors, do black people need nothing of the sort?"
2110,"It will demand broad-minded, upright men, both white and black, and in its final accomplishment American civilization will triumph"
2111,"So far as white men are concerned, this fact is to-day being recognized in the South, and a happy renaissance of university education seems imminent"
2112,"The dangerously clear logic of the Negro’s position will more and more loudly assert itself in that day when increasing wealth and more intricate social organization preclude the South from being, as it so largely is, simply an armed camp for intimidating black folk"
2113,"And as the black third of the land grows in thrift and skill, unless skilfully guided in its larger philosophy, it must more and more brood over the red past and the creeping, crooked present, until it grasps a gospel of revolt and revenge and throws its new-found energies athwart the current of advance"
2114,"The rape which your gentlemen have done against helpless black women in defiance of your own laws is written on the foreheads of two millions of mulattoes, and written in ineffaceable blood"
2115,"I insist that the question of the future is how best to keep these millions from brooding over the wrongs of the past and the difficulties of the present, so that all their energies may be bent toward a cheerful striving and cooperation with their white neighbors toward a larger, juster, and fuller future"
2116,"We shall hardly induce black men to believe that if their stomachs be full, it matters little about their brains"
2117,"They already dimly perceive that the paths of peace winding between honest toil and dignified manhood call for the guidance of skilled thinkers, the loving, reverent comradeship between the black lowly and the black men emancipated by training and culture"
2118,Herein the longing of black men must have respect:
2119,"And to themselves in these the days that try their souls, the chance to soar in the dim blue air above the smoke is to their finer spirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black"
2120,Is this the life you long to change into the dull red hideousness of Georgia?
2121,"I am black but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon"
2122,Thus like a snake the black population writhed upward
2123,"” There will be no objection,—already four other white men, and a little white girl with her nurse, are in there"
2124,but the white coach is all white
2125,The discomfort lies chiefly in the hearts of those four black men yonder—and in mine
2126,"The bare red clay and pines of Northern Georgia begin to disappear, and in their place appears a rich rolling land, luxuriant, and here and there well tilled"
2127,"three rough field-hands and two or three white loafers accompany us, and the newsboy still spreads his wares at one end"
2128,hot with the sun and damp with the rich black swamp-land;
2129,"But on Saturday suddenly the whole county disgorges itself upon the place, and a perfect flood of black peasantry pours through the streets, fills the stores, blocks the sidewalks, chokes the thoroughfares, and takes full possession of the town"
2130,"Now the world has well-nigh forgotten what the country is, and we must imagine a little city of black people scattered far and wide over three hundred lonesome square miles of land, without train or trolley, in the midst of cotton and corn, and wide patches of sand and gloomy soil"
2131,"Here is one of them now,—a tall brown man, a hard worker and a hard drinker, illiterate, but versed in farmlore, as his nodding crops declare"
2132,"Benton is an intelligent yellow man with a good-sized family, and manages a plantation blasted by the war and now the broken staff of the widow"
2133,"Then he went, and his neighbors too, and now only the black tenant remains;"
2134,"but the shadow-hand of the master’s grand-nephew or cousin or creditor stretches out of the gray distance to collect the rack-rent remorselessly, and so the land is uncared-for and poor"
2135,"Only black tenants can stand such a system, and they only because they must"
2136,Ten miles we have ridden to-day and have seen no white face
2137,"A resistless feeling of depression falls slowly upon us, despite the gaudy sunshine and the green cottonfields"
2138,"Three black tenants live on his place, and in his little store he keeps a small stock of tobacco, snuff, soap, and soda, for the neighborhood"
2139,"The Big House stands in half-ruin, its great front door staring blankly at the street, and the back part grotesquely restored for its black tenant"
2140,He digs hard to pay rent to the white girl who owns the remnant of the place
2141,"We had come to the boundaries of Dougherty, and were about to turn west along the county-line, when all these sights were pointed out to us by a kindly old man, black, white-haired, and seventy"
2142,"Forty-five years he had lived here, and now supports himself and his old wife by the help of the steer tethered yonder and the charity of his black neighbors"
2143,"Great dismantled trunks of pines tower above the green cottonfields, cracking their naked gnarled fingers toward the border of living forest beyond"
2144,"Of course Harrison Gohagen,—a quiet yellow man, young, smooth-faced, and diligent,—of course he is lord of some hundred acres, and we expect to see a vision of well-kept rooms and fat beds and laughing children"
2145,"An old ragged black man, honest, simple, and improvident, told us the tale"
2146,"White slender-legged curlews flitted by us, and the garnet blooms of the cotton looked gay against the green and purple stalks"
2147,"A peasant girl was hoeing in the field, white-turbaned and black-limbed"
2148,"pendent gray moss and brackish waters appear, and forests filled with wildfowl"
2149,"In one place the wood is on fire, smouldering in dull red anger;"
2150,"great dark green shadows fade into the black background, until all is one mass of tangled semi-tropical foliage, marvellous in its weird savage splendor"
2151,"Once we crossed a black silent stream, where the sad trees and writhing creepers, all glinting fiery yellow and green, seemed like some vast cathedral,—some green Milan builded of wildwood"
2152,"His war-cry reached the red Creeks of Dougherty, and their war-cry rang from the Chattahoochee to the sea"
2153,Then the false slime closing about them called the white men from the east
2154,Then came the black slaves
2155,"a wide rambling old mansion, brown and dingy, filled now with the grandchildren of the slaves who once waited on its tables;"
2156,"So we ride on, past phantom gates and falling homes,—past the once flourishing farms of the Smiths, the Gandys, and the Lagores,—and find all dilapidated and half ruined, even there where a solitary white woman, a relic of other days, sits alone in state among miles of Negroes and rides to town in her ancient coach each day"
2157,The red-clay sub-soil already had begun to peer above the loam
2158,Here sits a pretty blue-eyed quadroon hiding her bare feet;
2159,"Across the way is Gatesby, brown and tall, lord of two thousand acres shrewdly won and held"
2160,"There is a store conducted by his black son, a blacksmith shop, and a ginnery"
2161,Five miles below here is a town owned and controlled by one white New Englander
2162,"He owns almost a Rhode Island county, with thousands of acres and hundreds of black laborers"
2163,and in one of the houses of the whites a worthless black boy was harbored too openly two years ago;
2164,"the white folks say it is ever full of black criminals,—the black folks say that only colored boys are sent to jail, and they not because they are guilty, but because the State needs criminals to eke out its income by their forced labor"
2165,Here and there are black free-holders:
2166,"His master helped him to get a start, but when the black man died last fall the master’s sons immediately laid claim to the estate"
2167,"“And them white folks will get it, too,” said my yellow gossip"
2168,A young black fellow greets us
2169,"After the war it was for many years worked by gangs of Negro convicts,—and black convicts then were even more plentiful than now;"
2170,"Then they took the convicts from the plantations, but not until one of the fairest regions of the “Oakey Woods” had been ruined and ravished into a red waste, out of which only a Yankee or an immigrant could squeeze more blood from debt-cursed tenants"
2171,"Twenty years yonder sunken-cheeked, old black man has labored under that system, and now, turned day-laborer, is supporting his wife and boarding himself on his wages of a dollar and a half a week, received only part of the year"
2172,"They are not happy, these black men whom we meet throughout this region"
2173,I remember one big red-eyed black whom we met by the roadside
2174,"He stopped us to inquire after the black boy in Albany, whom it was said a policeman had shot and killed for loud talking on the sidewalk"
2175,"“Let a white man touch me, and he dies;"
2176,"There go part of them to the fields now,—three big boys astride mules, and a strapping girl with bare brown legs"
2177,"He was an old, hollow-cheeked man, with a drawn and characterful brown face"
2178,"Then he continued, “My mule died last week,”—a calamity in this land equal to a devastating fire in town,—‘but a white man loaned me another"
2179,"” Then he added, eyeing us, “Oh, I gets along with white folks"
2180,"Sad and bitter tales lie hidden back of those white doors,—tales of poverty, of struggle, of disappointment"

2182,"He was a Baptist preacher, and when he died, two thousand black people followed him to the grave;"
2183,"It is a joy to meet him,—a great broad-shouldered, handsome black man, intelligent and jovial"
2184,"Six hundred and fifty acres he owns, and has eleven black tenants"
2185,"We pass the Munson place, where a plucky white widow is renting and struggling;"
2186,the silent old black woman patching pantaloons and saying never a word;
2187,"Have you ever seen a cotton-field white with harvest,—its golden fleece hovering above the black earth like a silvery cloud edged with dark green, its bold white signals waving like the foam of billows from Carolina to Texas across that Black and human Sea?"
2188,"All through the Carolinas and Georgia, away down to Mexico, rise these gaunt red buildings, bare and homely, and yet so busy and noisy withal that they scarce seem to belong to the slow and sleepy land"
2189,"To-day, then, my reader, let us turn our faces to the Black Belt of Georgia and seek simply to know the condition of the black farm-laborers of one county there"
2190,"All over the face of the land is the one-room cabin,—now standing in the shadow of the Big House, now staring at the dusty road, now rising dark and sombre amid the green of the cotton-fields"
2191,"Within is a fireplace, black and smoky, and usually unsteady with age"
2192,"white laborers would be offered better accommodations, and might, for that and similar reasons, give better work"
2193,"Looking now at the county black population as a whole, it is fair to characterize it as poor and ignorant"
2194,Much that the white boy imbibes from his earliest social atmosphere forms the puzzling problems of the black boy’s mature years
2195,"Ignorant it may be, and poverty stricken, black and curious in limb and ways and thought;"
2196,These black thousands are not in reality lazy;
2197,"One of them lives there yet,—a short, stocky man, his dull-brown face seamed and drawn, and his tightly curled hair gray-white"
2198,"The most piteous thing amid all the black ruin of war-time, amid the broken fortunes of the masters, the blighted hopes of mothers and maidens, and the fall of an empire,—the most piteous thing amid all this was the black freedman who threw down his hoe because the world called him free"
2199,"As soon as the green cotton-leaves appear above the ground, another mortgage is given on the “crop"
2200,"When cotton rose to ten cents last fall, the shrewd merchants of Dougherty County sold a thousand buggies in one season, mostly to black men"
2201,"So skilfully and so closely has he drawn the bonds of the law about the tenant, that the black man has often simply to choose between pauperism and crime;"
2202,"as soon as it is ready for market he takes possession of it, sells it, pays the landowner his rent, subtracts his bill for supplies, and if, as sometimes happens, there is anything left, he hands it over to the black serf for his Christmas celebration"
2203,"There is no use asking the black tenant, then, to diversify his crops,—he cannot under this system"
2204,"A young black fellow sat in it driving listlessly, his elbows on his knees"
2205,the meal was in a white bushel bag
2206,The net indebtedness of the black tenant families of the whole county must have been at least sixty thousand dollars
2207,And to all this must be added the obvious fact that a slave ancestry and a system of unrequited toil has not improved the efficiency or temper of the mass of black laborers
2208,"I see now that ragged black man sitting on a log, aimlessly whittling a stick"
2209,white man sittin’ down gits all
2210,"If such a peon should run away, the sheriff, elected by white suffrage, can usually be depended on to catch the fugitive, return him, and ask no questions"
2211,This represents the lowest economic depths of the black American peasant;
2212,"The “Associated Press” recently informed the world of the arrest of a young white man in Southern Georgia who represented the “Atlantic Naval Supplies Company,” and who “was caught in the act of enticing hands from the turpentine farm of Mr. John Greer"
2213,"Similar to such measures is the unwritten law of the back districts and small towns of the South, that the character of all Negroes unknown to the mass of the community must be vouched for by some white man"
2214,"In many instances this system has been of great good to the Negro, and very often under the protection and guidance of the former master’s family, or other white friends, the freedman progressed in wealth and morality"
2215,"A black stranger in Baker County, Georgia, for instance, is liable to be stopped anywhere on the public highway and made to state his business to the satisfaction of any white interrogator"
2216,"Thus it is that in the country districts of the South, by written or unwritten law, peonage, hindrances to the migration of labor, and a system of white patronage exists over large areas"
2217,"it was primarily a huddling for self-protection,—a massing of the black population for mutual defence in order to secure the peace and tranquillity necessary to economic advance"
2218,"Why do not the Negroes become land-owners, and build up the black landed peasantry, which has for a generation and more been the dream of philanthropist and statesman?"
2219,"To the car-window sociologist, to the man who seeks to understand and know the South by devoting the few leisure hours of a holiday trip to unravelling the snarl of centuries,—to such men very often the whole trouble with the black field-hand may be summed up by Aunt Ophelia’s word, “Shiftless!” They have noted repeatedly scenes like one I saw last summer"
2220,"A couple of young black fellows passed us in a muleteam, with several bushels of loose corn in the ear"
2221,"Above all, they cannot see why they should take unusual pains to make the white man’s land better, or to fatten his mule, or save his corn"
2222,"On the other hand, the white land-owner argues that any attempt to improve these laborers by increased responsibility, or higher wages, or better homes, or land of their own, would be sure to result in failure"
2223,The Negro dimly personifies in the white man all his ills and misfortunes;
2224,"if he is poor, it is because the white man seizes the fruit of his toil;"
2225,"if he is ignorant, it is because the white man gives him neither time nor facilities to learn;"
2226,"“Why, you niggers have an easier time than I do,” said a puzzled Albany merchant to his black customer"
2227,"Taking, then, the dissatisfied and shiftless field-hand as a starting-point, let us inquire how the black thousands of Dougherty have struggled from him up toward their ideal, and what that ideal is"
2228,"Above the croppers come the great mass of the black population who work the land on their own responsibility, paying rent in cotton and supported by the crop-mortgage system"
2229,"On the other hand, if the rent was too high, or if the land deteriorated, the result was to discourage and check the efforts of the black peasantry"
2230,but in the vast majority of cases the rule was to extract the uttermost farthing from the mass of the black farm laborers
2231,” On this low plane half the black population of Dougherty County—perhaps more than half the black millions of this land—are to-day struggling
2232,"If there were any such at that time,—and there may have been a few,—their land was probably held in the name of some white patron,—a method not uncommon during slavery"
2233,"If all the black land-owners who had ever held land here had kept it or left it in the hands of black men, the Negroes would have owned nearer thirty thousand acres than the fifteen thousand they now hold"
2234,A glance at the distribution of land among the black owners curiously reveals this fact
2235,"It is my present task, therefore, to indicate, from my point of view, how the black race in the South meet and mingle with the whites in these matters of everyday life"
2236,"A Negro slum may be in dangerous proximity to a white residence quarter, while it is quite common to find a white slum planted in the heart of a respectable Negro district"
2237,"On the other hand, the settled belief of the mass of the Negroes that the Southern white people do not have the black man’s best interests at heart has been intensified in later years by this continual daily contact of the better class of blacks with the worst representatives of the white race"
2238,The average American can easily conceive of a rich land awaiting development and filled with black laborers
2239,"What the black laborer needs is careful personal guidance, group leadership of men with hearts in their bosoms, to train them to foresight, carefulness, and honesty"
2240,"I will not stop here to inquire whose duty it was—whether that of the white ex-master who had profited by unpaid toil, or the Northern philanthropist whose persistence brought on the crisis, or the National Government whose edict freed the bondmen;"
2241,"Into the hands of these men the Southern laborers, white and black, have fallen;"
2242,"Even the white laborers are not yet intelligent, thrifty, and well trained enough to maintain themselves against the powerful inroads of organized capital"
2243,"But among the black laborers all this is aggravated, first, by a race prejudice which varies from a doubt and distrust among the best element of whites to a frenzied hatred among the worst;"
2244,"I have seen, in the Black Belt of Georgia, an ignorant, honest Negro buy and pay for a farm in installments three separate times, and then in the face of law and decency the enterprising American who sold it to him pocketed the money and deed and left the black man landless, to labor on his own land at thirty cents a day"
2245,"I have seen a black farmer fall in debt to a white storekeeper, and that storekeeper go to his farm and strip it of every single marketable article,—mules, ploughs, stored crops, tools, furniture, bedding, clocks, looking-glass,—and all this without a sheriff or officer, in the face of the law for homestead exemptions, and without rendering to a single responsible person any account or reckoning"
2246,"This unfortunate economic situation does not mean the hindrance of all advance in the black South, or the absence of a class of black landlords and mechanics who, in spite of disadvantages, are accumulating property and making good citizens"
2247,"If this is true, then here is the path out of the economic situation, and here is the imperative demand for trained Negro leaders of character and intelligence,—men of skill, men of light and leading, college-bred men, black captains of industry, and missionaries of culture;"
2248,"The black vote that still remained was not trained and educated, but further debauched by open and unblushing bribery, or force and fraud;"
2249,"And finally, now, to-day, when we are awakening to the fact that the perpetuity of republican institutions on this continent depends on the purification of the ballot, the civic training of voters, and the raising of voting to the plane of a solemn duty which a patriotic citizen neglects to his peril and to the peril of his children’s children,—in this day, when we are striving for a renaissance of civic virtue, what are we going to say to the black voter of the South?"
2250,it has been plainly and frankly declared in nearly every case that the object of the disfranchising laws is the elimination of the black man from politics
2251,"Can we establish a mass of black laborers and artisans and landholders in the South who, by law and public opinion, have absolutely no voice in shaping the laws under which they live and work?"
2252,"To-day the black man of the South has almost nothing to say as to how much he shall be taxed, or how those taxes shall be expended;"
2253,It is pitiable that frantic efforts must be made at critical times to get law-makers in some States even to listen to the respectful presentation of the black man’s side of a current controversy
2254,they are executed by men who have absolutely no motive for treating the black people with courtesy or consideration;
2255,I should be the last to withhold sympathy from the white South in its efforts to solve its intricate social problems
2256,"I have already pointed out how sorely in need of such economic and spiritual guidance the emancipated Negro was, and I am quite willing to admit that if the representatives of the best white Southern public opinion were the ruling and guiding powers in the South to-day the conditions indicated would be fairly well fulfilled"
2257,"For such dealing with criminals, white or black, the South had no machinery, no adequate jails or reformatories;"
2258,"its police system was arranged to deal with blacks alone, and tacitly assumed that every white man was ipso facto a member of that police"
2259,"Thus grew up a double system of justice, which erred on the white side by undue leniency and the practical immunity of red-handed criminals, and erred on the black side by undue severity, injustice, and lack of discrimination"
2260,"the Negroes refused to believe the evidence of white witnesses or the fairness of white juries, so that the greatest deterrent to crime, the public opinion of one’s own social caste, was lost, and the criminal was looked upon as crucified rather than hanged"
2261,"Of every five dollars spent for public education in the State of Georgia, the white schools get four dollars and the Negro one dollar;"
2262,"and even then the white public-school system, save in the cities, is bad and cries for reform"
2263,"The centre of this spiritual turmoil has ever been the millions of black freedmen and their sons, whose destiny is so fatefully bound up with that of the nation"
2264,"or again at the close of a day’s wandering he may find himself in some strange assembly, where all faces are tinged brown or black, and where he has the vague, uncomfortable feeling of the stranger"
2265,"no mistakes are made, or if one occurs, the swift arm of the law and of public opinion swings down for a moment, as when the other day a black man and a white woman were arrested for talking together on Whitehall Street in Atlanta"
2266,"Before and directly after the war, when all the best of the Negroes were domestic servants in the best of the white families, there were bonds of intimacy, affection, and sometimes blood relationship, between the races"
2267,The daily paper chronicles the doings of the black world from afar with no great regard for accuracy;
2268,"The white man, as well as the Negro, is bound and barred by the color-line, and many a scheme of friendliness and philanthropy, of broad-minded sympathy and generous fellowship between the two has dropped still-born because some busybody has forced the color-question to the front and brought the tremendous force of unwritten law against the innovators"
2269,"In a world where it means so much to take a man by the hand and sit beside him, to look frankly into his eyes and feel his heart beating with red blood;"
2270,"The black beggar is never turned away without a good deal more than a crust, and a call for help for the unfortunate meets quick response"
2271,"“Were any black people receiving aid?” “Why,” said he, “they were all black"
2272,"And when, by proscription and prejudice, these same Negroes are classed with and treated like the lowest of their people, simply because they are Negroes, such a policy not only discourages thrift and intelligence among black men, but puts a direct premium on the very things you complain of,—inefficiency and crime"
2273,"In the face of two such arguments, the future of the South depends on the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and appreciate and sympathize with each other’s position,—for the Negro to realize more deeply than he does at present the need of uplifting the masses of his people, for the white people to realize more vividly than they have yet done the deadening and disastrous effect of a color-prejudice that classes Phillis Wheatley and Sam Hose in the same despised class"
2274,"It is not enough for the Negroes to declare that color-prejudice is the sole cause of their social condition, nor for the white South to reply that their social condition is the main cause of prejudice"
2275,"Dim face of Beauty haunting all the world, Fair face of Beauty all too fair to see, Where the lost stars adown the heavens are hurled,— There, there alone for thee May white peace be"
2276,"And so most striking to me, as I approached the village and the little plain church perched aloft, was the air of intense excitement that possessed that mass of black folk"
2277,The black and massive form of the preacher swayed and quivered as the words crowded to his lips and flew at us in singular eloquence
2278,"The people moaned and fluttered, and then the gaunt-cheeked brown woman beside me suddenly leaped straight into the air and shrieked like a lost soul, while round about came wail and groan and outcry, and a scene of human passion such as I had never conceived before"
2279,"Since under the peculiar circumstances of the black man’s environment they were the one expression of his higher life, they are of deep interest to the student of his development, both socially and psychologically"
2280,"There is an organized Negro church for every sixty black families in the nation, and in some States for every forty families, owning, on an average, a thousand dollars’ worth of property each, or nearly twenty-six million dollars in all"
2281,"The plantation organization replaced the clan and tribe, and the white master replaced the chief with far greater and more despotic powers"
2282,"Next in popularity came the churches organized in connection with the white neighboring churches, chiefly Baptist and Methodist, with a few Episcopalian and others"
2283,"After Emancipation, and still earlier in the North, the Negro churches largely severed such affiliations as they had had with the white churches, either by choice or by compulsion"
2284,"This gave rise to the great African Methodist Church, the greatest Negro organization in the world, to the Zion Church and the Colored Methodist, and to the black conferences and churches in this and other denominations"
2285,"By the middle of the eighteenth century the black slave had sunk, with hushed murmurs, to his place at the bottom of a new economic system, and was unconsciously ripe for a new philosophy of life"
2286,"Here it was that the Home was ruined under the very shadow of the Church, white and black;"
2287,"But we must not forget that his chief influence was internal,—was exerted on the black world;"
2288,"Through fugitive slaves and irrepressible discussion this desire for freedom seized the black millions still in bondage, and became their one ideal of life"
2289,"The black bards caught new notes, and sometimes even dared to sing,—"
2290,"For fifty years Negro religion thus transformed itself and identified itself with the dream of Abolition, until that which was a radical fad in the white North and an anarchistic plot in the white South had become a religion to the black world"
2291,"On the other hand, another type of mind, shrewder and keener and more tortuous too, sees in the very strength of the anti-Negro movement its patent weaknesses, and with Jesuitic casuistry is deterred by no ethical considerations in the endeavor to turn this weakness to the black man’s strength"
2292,"It is no idle regret with which the white South mourns the loss of the old-time Negro,—the frank, honest, simple old servant who stood for the earlier religious age of submission and humility"
2293,to-day it must be prepared to see its black proletariat turn that same two-edged weapon against itself
2294,"Patience, humility, and adroitness must, in these growing black youth, replace impulse, manliness, and courage"
2295,"the better classes segregate themselves from the group-life of both white and black, and form an aristocracy, cultured but pessimistic, whose bitter criticism stings while it points out no way of escape"
2296,"Their churches are differentiating,—now into groups of cold, fashionable devotees, in no way distinguishable from similar white groups save in color of skin;"
2297,"now into large social and business institutions catering to the desire for information and amusement of their members, warily avoiding unpleasant questions both within and without the black world, and preaching in effect if not in word:"
2298,"“Unto you a child is born,” sang the bit of yellow paper that fluttered into my room one brown October morning"
2299,"How beautiful he was, with his olive-tinted flesh and dark gold ringlets, his eyes of mingled blue and brown, his perfect little limbs, and the soft voluptuous roll which the blood of Africa had moulded into his features!"
2300,"I held him in my arms, after we had sped far away from our Southern home,—held him, and glanced at the hot red soil of Georgia and the breathless city of a hundred hills, and felt a vague unrest"
2301,"Why had not the brown of his eyes crushed out and killed the blue?—for brown were his father’s eyes, and his father’s father’s"
2302,I too mused above his little white bed;
2303,saw the dream of my black fathers stagger a step onward in the wild phantasm of the world;
2304,"And then one night the little feet pattered wearily to the wee white bed, and the tiny hands trembled;"
2305,"The Shadow of Death!” Out into the starlight I crept, to rouse the gray physician,—the Shadow of Death, the Shadow of Death"
2306,"when the winds spoke not, and the trees, the great green trees he loved, stood motionless"
2307,"the same tall trees peeped in at the windows, the same green grass glinted in the setting sun"
2308,"He loved the white matron, he loved his black nurse;"
2309,"We seemed to rumble down an unknown street behind a little white bundle of posies, with the shadow of a song in our ears"
2310,"beneath thy broad blue sky shall my dark baby rest in peace,—where Reverence dwells, and Goodness, and a Freedom that is free?"
2311,"a morning when men ask of the workman, not “Is he white?” but “Can he work?” When men ask artists, not “Are they black?” but “Do they know?” Some morning this may be, long, long years to come"
2312,"This is the story of a human heart,—the tale of a black boy who many long years ago began to struggle with life that he might know the world and know himself"
2313,Three temptations he met on those dark dunes that lay gray and dismal before the wonder-eyes of the child:
2314,"the temptation of Hate, that stood out against the red dawn;"
2315,"Tall, frail, and black he stood, with simple dignity and an unmistakable air of good breeding"
2316,"Some seer he seemed, that came not from the crimson Past or the gray To-come, but from the pulsing Now,—that mocking world which seemed to me at once so light and dark, so splendid and sordid"
2317,The black-faced lad that paused over his mud and marbles seventy years ago saw puzzling vistas as he looked down the world
2318,"The slave-ship still groaned across the Atlantic, faint cries burdened the Southern breeze, and the great black father whispered mad tales of cruelty into those young ears"
2319,So the black boy asked of sky and sun and flower the never-answered Why?
2320,"“I’m going to bring a black boy here to educate,” said Beriah Green, as only a crank and an abolitionist would have dared to say"
2321,"Once before, the black boy had sought a school, had travelled, cold and hungry, four hundred miles up into free New Hampshire, to Canaan"
2322,The black boy trudged away
2323,"So in that little Oneida school there came to those schoolboys a revelation of thought and longing beneath one black skin, of which they had not dreamed before"
2324,"Through it the child now first saw the blue and gold of life,—the sun-swept road that ran ’twixt heaven and earth until in one far-off wan wavering line they met and kissed"
2325,"And then from that Vision Splendid all the glory faded slowly away, and left an earth gray and stern rolling on beneath a dark despair"
2326,Even the kind hands that stretched themselves toward him from out the depths of that dull morning seemed but parts of the purple shadows
2327,"Paul’s the venerable Bishop raised his white arms above the Negro deacon—even then the burden had not lifted from that heart, for there had passed a glory from the earth"
2328,"Bishop Onderdonk lived at the head of six white steps,—corpulent, red-faced, and the author of several thrilling tracts on Apostolic Succession"
2329,"the frail black figure, nervously twitching his hat before the massive abdomen of Bishop Onderdonk;"
2330,A little blue fly is trying to cross the yawning keyhole
2331,So surged the thought within that lone black breast
2332,"And if you find that riddle hard to read, remember that yonder black boy finds it just a little harder;"
2333,In another age he might have sat among the elders of the land in purple-bordered toga;
2334,"Carlisle Street runs westward from the centre of Johnstown, across a great black bridge, down a hill and up again, by little shops and meat-markets, past single-storied homes, until suddenly it stops against a wide green lawn"
2335,"When at evening the winds come swelling from the east, and the great pall of the city’s smoke hangs wearily above the valley, then the red west glows like a dreamland down Carlisle Street, and, at the tolling of the supper-bell, throws the passing forms of students in dark silhouette against the sky"
2336,"for this is Wells Institute, and these black students have few dealings with the white city below"
2337,"A long, straggling fellow he is, brown and hard-haired, who seems to be growing straight out of his clothes, and walks with a half-apologetic roll"
2338,"The white folk of Altamaha voted John a good boy,—fine plough-hand, good in the rice-fields, handy everywhere, and always good-natured and respectful"
2339,"But full half the black folk followed him proudly to the station, and carried his queer little trunk and many bundles"
2340,"So the train came, and he pinched his little sister lovingly, and put his great arms about his mother’s neck, and then was away with a puff and a roar into the great yellow world that flamed and flared about the doubtful pilgrim"
2341,But the white people shook their heads
2342,"John is at Princeton, sir,” said the broad-shouldered gray-haired Judge every morning as he marched down to the post-office"
2343,"And yet it was singular that few thought of two Johns,—for the black folk thought of one John, and he was black;"
2344,"and the white folk thought of another John, and he was white"
2345,"He stared at the gray-haired man blankly, with great eyes"
2346,"As the light dawned lingeringly on his new creations, he sat rapt and silent before the vision, or wandered alone over the green campus peering through and beyond the world of men into a world of thought"
2347,He grew slowly to feel almost for the first time the Veil that lay between him and the white world;
2348,"“With all your professions, one never sees in the North so cordial and intimate relations between white and black as are everyday occurrences with us"
2349,"He looked thoughtfully across the hall, and wondered why the beautiful gray-haired woman looked so listless, and what the little man could be whispering about"
2350,"the black John smiled lightly, then grimly, and followed the usher down the aisle"
2351,It was noontide on a gray and cloudy day when he came
2352,"The black town flocked to the depot, with a little of the white at the edges,—a happy throng, with “Good-mawnings” and “Howdys” and laughing and joking and jostling"
2353,"but sister Jennie stood on the platform, nervously fingering her dress, tall and lithe, with soft brown skin and loving eyes peering from out a tangled wilderness of hair"
2354,"a little dingy station, a black crowd gaudy and dirty, a half-mile of dilapidated shanties along a straggling ditch of mud"
2355,But the white postmaster from the edge of the crowd expressed the opinion of his folks plainly
2356,"He was wrinkled and black, with scant gray and tufted hair;"
2357,"Long they stood together, peering over the gray unresting water"
2358,"but you and I both know, John, that in this country the Negro must remain subordinate, and can never expect to be the equal of white men"
2359,"But when they want to reverse nature, and rule white men, and marry white women, and sit in my parlor, then, by God!"
2360,The whole white town was glad
2361,"a Nigger what won’t say ‘sir’ to a white man, or—”"
2362,"“Why, it’s little black John, Peggy’s son,—your old playfellow"
2363,The white people of Altamaha are not spending their money on black folks to have their heads crammed with impudence and lies
2364,"He seemed a young man pleasant to look upon, as he sat on the great black stump at the edge of the pines idly swinging his legs and smoking"
2365,"He looked with interest at first, and then burst into a laugh as he said, “Well, I declare, if it isn’t Jennie, the little brown kitchen-maid!"
2366,The great brown sea lay silent
2367,The dying day bathed the twisted oaks and mighty pines in black and gold
2368,"There was only a black man hurrying on with an ache in his heart, seeing neither sun nor sea, but starting as from a dream at the frightened cry that woke the pines, to see his dark sister struggling in the arms of a tall and fair-haired man"
2369,"He said not a word, but, seizing a fallen limb, struck him with all the pent-up hatred of his great black arm, and the body lay white and still beneath the pines, all bathed in sunshine and in blood"
2370,"Then, without another word, he went out into the narrow lane, up by the straight pines, to the same winding path, and seated himself on the great black stump, looking at the blood where the body had lain"
2371,"Yonder in the gray past he had played with that dead boy, romping together under the solemn trees"
2372,"Amid the trees in the dim morning twilight he watched their shadows dancing and heard their horses thundering toward him, until at last they came sweeping like a storm, and he saw in front that haggard white-haired man, whose eyes flashed red with fury"
2373,"And so before each thought that I have written in this book I have set a phrase, a haunting echo of these weird old songs in which the soul of the black slave spoke to men"
2374,"To me Jubilee Hall seemed ever made of the songs themselves, and its bricks were red with the blood and dust of toil"
2375,"The Sea Islands of the Carolinas, where they met, were filled with a black folk of primitive type, touched and moulded less by the world about them than any others outside the Black Belt"
2376,"Here he formed a Sunday-school class of black children in , and sang with them and taught them to sing"
2377,"North to Cincinnati they rode,—four half-clothed black boys and five girl-women,—led by a man with a cause and a purpose"
2378,"They stopped at Wilberforce, the oldest of Negro schools, where a black bishop blessed them"
2379,"They tell us in these eager days that life was joyous to the black slave, careless and happy"
2380,"One might go further and find a fourth step in this development, where the songs of white America have been distinctively influenced by the slave songs or have incorporated whole phrases of Negro melody, as “Swanee River” and “Old Black Joe"
2381,Life was a “rough and rolling sea” like the brown Atlantic of the Sea Islands;
2382,"A black woman said of the song, “It can’t be sung without a full heart and a troubled sperrit"
2383,"A green and yellow parrot, which hung in a cage outside the door, kept repeating over and over:"
2384,"His hair was brown and straight, parted on one side"
2385,"She was a fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves"
2386,"Farther down, before one of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down, telling her beads"
2387,He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail’s pace from the beach
2388,He could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile
2389,"The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue of the horizon"
2390,"Beneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert Lebrun"
2391,Mrs. Pontellier talked about her father’s Mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in the old Kentucky blue-grass country
2392,the blue eyes that were like nothing but sapphires;
2393,"two lips that pouted, that were so red one could only think of cherries or some other delicious crimson fruit in looking at them"
2394,One would not have wanted her white neck a mite less full or her beautiful arms more slender
2395,"Two of them clung about her white skirts, the third she took from its nurse and with a thousand endearments bore it along in her own fond, encircling arms"
2396,"The two women went away one morning to the beach together, arm in arm, under the huge white sunshade"
2397,There were acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand
2398,"Further away still, vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of orange or lemon trees intervening"
2399,The dark green clusters glistened from afar in the sun
2400,"She wore a cool muslin that morning—white, with a waving vertical line of brown running through it;"
2401,also a white linen collar and the big straw hat which she had taken from the peg outside the door
2402,"The hat rested any way on her yellow-brown hair, that waved a little, was heavy, and clung close to her head"
2403,The lady in black was reading her morning devotions on the porch of a neighboring bath-house
2404,The day was clear and carried the gaze out as far as the blue sky went;
2405,there were a few white clouds suspended idly over the horizon
2406,"“First of all, the sight of the water stretching so far away, those motionless sails against the blue sky, made a delicious picture that I just wanted to sit and look at"
2407,"I could see only the stretch of green before me, and I felt as if I must walk on forever, without coming to the end of it"
2408,"But do you know,” she broke off, turning her quick eyes upon Madame Ratignolle and leaning forward a little so as to bring her face quite close to that of her companion, “sometimes I feel this summer as if I were walking through the green meadow again;"
2409,"She could not leave his presence when he was there, nor remove her eyes from his face, which was something like Napoleon’s, with a lock of black hair failing across the forehead"
2410,"She thrust a bare, white arm from the curtain which shielded her open door, and received the cup from his hands"
2411,"Their heads might have been turned upside-down, so absolutely did they tread upon blue ether"
2412,"A little black girl sat on the floor, and with her hands worked the treadle of the machine"
2413,"Some one had gathered orange and lemon branches, and with these fashioned graceful festoons between"
2414,"The dark green of the branches stood out and glistened against the white muslin curtains which draped the windows, and which puffed, floated, and flapped at the capricious will of a stiff breeze that swept up from the Gulf"
2415,"They were girls of fourteen, always clad in the Virgin’s colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at their baptism"
2416,She had been properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk tights
2417,"Her little neck and arms were bare, and her hair, artificially crimped, stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head"
2418,"Her poses were full of grace, and her little black-shod toes twinkled as they shot out and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were bewildering"
2419,"it had been made and frozen during the afternoon back of the kitchen by two black women, under the supervision of Victor"
2420,"She had absolutely no taste in dress, and wore a batch of rusty black lace with a bunch of artificial violets pinned to the side of her hair"
2421,"There were strange, rare odors abroad—a tangle of the sea smell and of weeds and damp, new-plowed earth, mingled with the heavy perfume of a field of white blossoms somewhere near"
2422,The white light of the moon had fallen upon the world like the mystery and the softness of sleep
2423,"The sea was quiet now, and swelled lazily in broad billows that melted into one another and did not break except upon the beach in little foamy crests that coiled back like slow, white serpents"
2424,"She had been walking alone with her arms hanging limp, letting her white skirts trail along the dewy path"
2425,Will you get my white shawl which I left on the window-sill over at the house?”
2426,"old Monsieur Farival, losing ground inch by inch, and a young barefooted Spanish girl, with a red kerchief on her head and a basket on her arm, bringing up the rear"
2427,"She had a round, sly, piquant face and pretty black eyes"
2428,"Edna looked at her feet, and noticed the sand and slime between her brown toes"
2429,The lady in black was counting her beads for the third time
2430,"She looked Mariequita up and down, from her ugly brown toes to her pretty black eyes, and back again"
2431,"They all went together up to the quaint little Gothic church of Our Lady of Lourdes, gleaming all brown and yellow with paint in the sun’s glare"
2432,"The long line of little gray, weather-beaten houses nestled peacefully among the orange trees"
2433,She was boiling mullets over a few red coals in the huge fireplace
2434,"She took off her shoes and stockings and stretched herself in the very center of the high, white bed"
2435,"But there was a cloth spread upon the table that stood against the wall, and a cover was laid for one, with a crusty brown loaf and a bottle of wine beside the plate"
2436,"Edna bit a piece from the brown loaf, tearing it with her strong, white teeth"
2437,"Then she went softly out of doors, and plucking an orange from the low-hanging bough of a tree, threw it at Robert, who did not know she was awake and up"
2438,An illumination broke over his whole face when he saw her and joined her under the orange tree
2439,"They waited a good while under the orange trees, till Madame Antoine came back, panting, waddling, with a thousand apologies to explain her absence"
2440,"It was very pleasant to stay there under the orange trees, while the sun dipped lower and lower, turning the western sky to flaming copper and gold"
2441,"When she and Robert stepped into Tonie’s boat, with the red lateen sail, misty spirit forms were prowling in the shadows and among the reeds, and upon the water were phantom ships, speeding to cover"
2442,"The youngster was in his long white nightgown, that kept tripping him up as Madame Ratignolle led him along by the hand"
2443,"Her head, set off by her dainty white gown, suggested a rich, rare blossom"
2444,"The lady in black had once received a pair of prayer-beads of curious workmanship from Mexico, with very special indulgence attached to them, but she had never been able to ascertain whether the indulgence extended outside the Mexican border"
2445,"He turned to answer some question put to him by his mother, and Edna, having finished her black coffee, left the table"
2446,The little black girl came in to say that Madame Lebrun would like to have Mrs. Pontellier go and sit with them over at the house till Mr. Robert went away
2447,"A maid, in white fluted cap, offered the callers liqueur, coffee, or chocolate, as they might desire"
2448,She inhaled the odor of the blossoms and thrust them into the bosom of her white morning gown
2449,"The tan of the seashore had left her face, and her forehead was smooth, white, and polished beneath her heavy, yellow-brown hair"
2450,"And she summoned a young black woman, whom she instructed, in French, to be very careful in checking off the list which she handed her"
2451,"Madame Ratignolle looked more beautiful than ever there at home, in a negligé which left her arms almost wholly bare and exposed the rich, melting curves of her white throat"
2452,"A black woman, wiping her hands upon her apron, was close at his heels"
2453,He instructed the black woman to go at once and inform Madame Lebrun that Mrs. Pontellier desired to see her
2454,"He at once explained that the black woman’s offensive conduct was all due to imperfect training, as he was not there to take her in hand"
2455,"What news do you bring this morning?” He was quite portly, with a profusion of gray hair, and small blue eyes which age had robbed of much of their brightness but none of their penetration"
2456,"His hair and mustache were white and silky, emphasizing the rugged bronze of his face"
2457,"Mr. Pontellier himself had no particular leaning toward horseracing, and was even rather inclined to discourage it as a pastime, especially when he considered the fate of that blue-grass farm in Kentucky"
2458,"Mrs. Highcamp was a worldly but unaffected, intelligent, slim, tall blonde woman in the forties, with an indifferent manner and blue eyes that stared"
2459,The atmosphere of the stables and the breath of the blue grass paddock revived in her memory and lingered in her nostrils
2460,She touched his hand as she scanned the red cicatrice on the inside of his white wrist
2461,” A piece of red flannel was wrapped around Mademoiselle’s throat;
2462,"it was red-hot, and the chocolate in the tin sizzled and sputtered"
2463,"It was the first time she had admitted it, and a glow overspread her face, blotching it with red spots"
2464,Because his hair is brown and grows away from his temples;
2465,"She was splendid and robust, and had never appeared handsomer than in the old blue gown, with a red silk handkerchief knotted at random around her head to protect her hair from the dust"
2466,Edna had sent her a fresh bunch of violets with black lace trimmings for her hair
2467,"There was something extremely gorgeous about the appearance of the table, an effect of splendor conveyed by a cover of pale yellow satin under strips of lace-work"
2468,"There were wax candles, in massive brass candelabra, burning softly under yellow silk shades;"
2469,"full, fragrant roses, yellow and red, abounded"
2470,"Mrs. Highcamp was weaving a garland of roses, yellow and red"
2471,"When she had finished the garland, she laid it lightly upon Victor’s black curls"
2472,"She took from the back of her chair a white silken scarf, with which she had covered her shoulders in the early part of the evening"
2473,"He did not seem to mind what she did to him, only smiled, showing a faint gleam of white teeth, while he continued to gaze with narrowing eyes at the light through his glass of champagne"
2474,“‘There was a graven image of Desire Painted with red blood on a ground of gold
2475,The wine spilled over Arobin’s legs and some of it trickled down upon Mrs. Highcamp’s black gauze gown
2476,"She looked down, noticing the black line of his leg moving in and out so close to her against the yellow shimmer of her gown"
2477,"picking pecans with Lidie’s little black brood, and hauling chips in their express wagon"
2478,"But it was a young black girl, who came in, bringing a small bundle of laundry, which she deposited in the adjoining room, and went away"
2479,“I’ve been seeing the waves and the white beach of Grand Isle;
2480,“I’ve been seeing the waves and the white beach of Grand Isle;
2481,"He went out to a neighboring cigar stand to purchase cigarette papers, and when he came back he found that Celestine had served the black coffee in the parlor"
2482,"very picturesque, with their black eyes and their lace scarfs"
2483,"The maid brought her a delicious printed scrawl from Raoul, expressing his love, asking her to send him some bonbons, and telling her they had found that morning ten tiny white pigs all lying in a row beside Lidie’s big white pig"
2484,"a small, leafy corner, with a few green tables under the orange trees"
2485,"An old cat slept all day on the stone step in the sun, and an old mulatresse slept her idle hours away in her chair at the open window, till some one happened to knock on one of the green tables"
2486,There was no one who could make such excellent coffee or fry a chicken so golden brown as she
2487,"She caught sight of a little green table, blotched with the checkered sunlight that filtered through the quivering leaves overhead"
2488,"Monsieur Ratignolle was putting up a mixture himself, very carefully, dropping a red liquid into a tiny glass"
2489,"She sat on the sofa, clad in an ample white peignoir, holding a handkerchief tight in her hand with a nervous clutch"
2490,"Her face was drawn and pinched, her sweet blue eyes haggard and unnatural"
2491,"The nurse, a comfortable looking Griffe woman in white apron and cap, was urging her to return to her bedroom"
2492,"But Madame only set her teeth hard into her under lip, and Edna saw the sweat gather in beads on her white forehead"
2493,"All along the white beach, up and down, there was no living thing in sight"
2494,"The foamy wavelets curled up to her white feet, and coiled like serpents about her ankles"
2495,"The water was deep, but she lifted her white body and reached out with a long, sweeping stroke"
2496,"She did not look back now, but went on and on, thinking of the blue-grass meadow that she had traversed when a little child, believing that it had no beginning and no end"
2497,"She was now a large, gaunt black woman, past thirty-five"
2498,"Evening was near when P’tit Maître, black with powder and crimson with blood, had staggered into the cabin of Jacqueline’s mother, his pursuers close at his heels"
2499,"But none of them had stroked her black hand quite as Chéri did, nor rested their heads against her knee so confidingly, nor fallen asleep in her arms as he used to do"
2500,"For Chéri hardly did such things now, since he had become the proud possessor of a gun, and had had his black curls cut off"
2501,"That summer—the summer Chéri gave La Folle two black curls tied with a knot of red ribbon—the water ran so low in the bayou that even the little children at Bellissime were able to cross it on foot, and the cattle were sent to pasture down by the river"
2502,His pockets all bulged out with almonds and raisins and an orange that he had secured for her from the very fine dinner which had been given that day up at his father’s house
2503,"When he had emptied his pockets, La Folle patted his round red cheek, wiped his soiled hands on her apron, and smoothed his hair"
2504,Her eyes were bloodshot and the saliva had gathered in a white foam on her black lips
2505,"Then the world that had looked red to La Folle suddenly turned black,—like that day she had seen powder and blood"
2506,"The moon rays, streaming in through the open door and windows, gave what light was needed to the old black mammy who stood at the table concocting a tisane of fragrant herbs"
2507,The first touch of the cool gray morning awoke La Folle
2508,"She donned her new blue cottonade and white apron, for she remembered that this was Sunday"
2509,"When she had made for herself a cup of strong black coffee, and drunk it with relish, she quitted the cabin and walked across the old familiar field to the bayou’s edge again"
2510,"There they were, stealing up to her from the thousand blue violets that peeped out from green, luxuriant beds"
2511,"When the war began, there stood on Côte Joyeuse an imposing mansion of red brick, shaped like the Pantheon"
2512,"Thirty years later, only the thick walls were standing, with the dull red brick showing here and there through a matted growth of clinging vines"
2513,"She was a queenly, white-haired woman of fifty"
2514,"Often, of pleasant afternoons, the two would drink their black coffee, seated upon the stone-flagged portico whose canopy was the blue sky of Louisiana"
2515,and her rounded cheek was tinged like the pink crèpe myrtle
2516,"Then her cheeks began to pale, till they were tinged like the creamy plumes of the white crèpe myrtle that grew in the ruin"
2517,"She held the hand of her sister who lay there, and smoothed down the woman’s soft brown hair"
2518,"Once Ma’ame Pélagie arose to mix a drink of orange-flower water, which she gave to her sister, as she would have offered it to a nervous, fretful child"
2519,"a robust old white-haired man, chiding her for returning home so late"
2520,"She begins to cry, and old black Clementine, her nurse, who is not far off, limps across the room to pick her up and carry her away"
2521,"But she gazes beyond the salon, back into the big dining hall, where the white crèpe myrtle grows"
2522,"Not till La Ricaneuse stands before her with bare, black arms akimbo, uttering a volley of vile abuse and of brazen impudence"
2523,The hurt which the big brass buttons of his new gray uniform pressed into the tender flesh of her bosom has never left it
2524,How the stigma stands out red as blood upon his blanched cheek!
2525,Not once did she look back upon the ruin that brooded like a huge monster—a black spot in the darkness that enveloped it
2526,"She was dressed in black, with the white kerchief she always wore folded across her bosom"
2527,"The roof came down steep and black like a cowl, reaching out beyond the wide galleries that encircled the yellow stuccoed house"
2528,"The young mother was recovering slowly, and lay full length, in her soft white muslins and laces, upon a couch"
2529,The yellow nurse woman sat beside a window fanning herself
2530,"She sat in her room, one hot afternoon, in her peignoir, listlessly drawing through her fingers the strands of her long, silky brown hair that hung about her shoulders"
2531,"it is not true, I am white!"
2532,"“As white as La Blanche’s,” he returned cruelly;"
2533,Désirée had not changed the thin white garment nor the slippers which she wore
2534,Her hair was uncovered and the sun’s rays brought a golden gleam from its brown meshes
2535,but could discern in the darkness only the approaching red point of a lighted cigar
2536,"She hoped to remain unnoticed, but her white gown revealed her to him"
2537,"“Your husband told me to bring this to you, Mrs. Baroda,” he said, handing her a filmy, white scarf with which she sometimes enveloped her head and shoulders"
2538,"there were some lavender, some all black and various shades of tan and gray"
2539,Mrs. Sommers selected a black pair and looked at them very long and closely
2540,"she craved a nice and tasty bite—a half dozen blue-points, a plump chop with cress, a something sweet—a crème-frappée, for instance;"
2541,"a glass of Rhine wine, and after all a small cup of black coffee"
2542,Their gray uniforms were worn beyond the point of shabbiness
2543,"Edmond could feel again the folds of the girl’s soft white gown, and see the droop of the angel-sleeves as she circled her fair arms about his neck"
2544,“What’s it all about?” wondered a big black bird perched in the top of the tallest tree
2545,"With a flap of his great, black wings he shot downward, circling toward the plain"
2546,"The fat, black horses went in a slow, measured trot, notwithstanding constant urging on the part of the fat, black coachman"
2547,"Octavie wore a plain black dress, severe in its simplicity"
2548,"He told of that autumn day drawing to its close, with the gold and the red fading out of the west, and the night gathering its shadows to cover the faces of the dead"
2549,with visage uplifted to the gray sky in an agony of supplication
2550,It was an old black veil of her Aunt Tavie’s
2551,"A whiff of dust from the road had blown in and she wiped her cheeks and her eyes with her soft, white handkerchief, a homemade handkerchief, fabricated from one of her old fine muslin petticoats"
2552,There was the old gray house with its sloping eaves
2553,"The captain stood before the dull gray view-screen, watched him a moment, thoughtfully"
2554,"Rogers, stripped to the waist, perspiring, his thick black hair hanging in his eyes;"
2555,I felt that his little beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate
2556,Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!
2557,It was always I who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor
2558,"It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief, blackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a week, with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite inefficacious"
2559,"His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur"
2560,All the branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to the water
2561,"We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin’s commerce—the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white sailing-vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay"
2562,"I went to the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but, failing to do so, I came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of them green eyes for I had some confused notion"
2563,The sailors’ eyes were blue and grey and even black
2564,The only sailor whose eyes could have been called green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay by calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell:
2565,I watched him lazily as I chewed one of those green stems on which girls tell fortunes
2566,I saw that he had great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth
2567,"There was nothing he liked, he said, so much as looking at a nice young girl, at her nice white hands and her beautiful soft hair"
2568,"The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces"
2569,The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns
2570,"I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her"
2571,"The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing"
2572,"It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease"
2573,"I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress"
2574,she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses
2575,Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it—not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs
2576,"Then she had to rush out as quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and returning home late under her load of provisions"
2577,The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct
2578,The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages
2579,"Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes"
2580,"She set her white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal"
2581,"Their sympathy, however, was for the blue cars—the cars of their friends, the French"
2582,"Each blue car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car"
2583,"He was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown moustache and rather innocent-looking grey eyes"
2584,"At the control Ségouin had presented him to one of the French competitors and, in answer to his confused murmur of compliment, the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth"
2585,The journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal
2586,"His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth"
2587,She wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat
2588,Her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather
2589,"The great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip"
2590,She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa
2591,"The ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom, stems upwards"
2592,"Frank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes"
2593,"After waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him and, when they turned to the right, he followed them, stepping lightly in his white shoes, down one side of Merrion Square"
2594,He paused at last before the window of a poor-looking shop over which the words Refreshment Bar were printed in white letters
2595,A cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum-pudding
2596,"He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw;"
2597,"Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which made her look like a little perverse madonna"
2598,Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind
2599,Her white instep shone in the opening of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin
2600,Her hopes and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows on which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for anything
2601,"His hands were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice was quiet and his manners were refined"
2602,The half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white teeth
2603,"He looked about him, but his sight was confused by the shining of many red and green wine-glasses"
2604,"His eyes, which were of bluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore"
2605,"Little Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth"
2606,Ignatius Gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon his friend
2607,A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn
2608,She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one Saturday
2609,The head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers
2610,"She was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her hat"
2611,"and she wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow"
2612,"and when, after a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes"
2613,"The curate, who was standing beside the table, nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity:"
2614,"In a few minutes the women began to come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their petticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arms"
2615,When she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad of her old brown waterproof
2616,He was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat;
2617,he had a square red face and a greyish moustache
2618,"a black iron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes-rack, a coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk"
2619,A bookcase had been made in an alcove by means of shelves of white wood
2620,The bed was clothed with white bedclothes and a black and scarlet rug covered the foot
2621,A little hand-mirror hung above the washstand and during the day a white-shaded lamp stood as the sole ornament of the mantelpiece
2622,The books on the white wooden shelves were arranged from below upwards according to bulk
2623,"In the desk lay a manuscript translation of Hauptmann’s Michael Kramer, the stage directions of which were written in purple ink, and a little sheaf of papers held together by a brass pin"
2624,"His face, which carried the entire tale of his years, was of the brown tint of Dublin streets"
2625,On his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a tawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth
2626,The eyes were very dark blue and steady
2627,The cabbage began to deposit a cold white grease on his plate
2628,"The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically when it closed"
2629,"He was a tall, slender young man with a light brown moustache"
2630,But Tricky Dicky’s little old father always had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner
2631,"His black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body and it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman’s collar or a layman’s, because the collar of his shabby frock-coat, the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his neck"
2632,He wore a round hat of hard black felt
2633,"His face, shining with raindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones"
2634,He opened his very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very bright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise
2635,I think he’s what you call a black sheep
2636,One of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure
2637,"He had a big face which resembled a young ox’s face in expression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache"
2638,"He would have had his Erin famed, The green flag gloriously unfurled, Her statesmen, bards and warriors raised Before the nations of the World"
2639,"His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard"
2640,"A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule;"
2641,"He was a little man, with a white vacant face"
2642,She noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat
2643,"The bass, Mr Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache"
2644,The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body
2645,Mr Holohan became very red and excited
2646,"While the point was being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long yellow ulster, came from the far end of the bar"
2647,On the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid
2648,Rather red face;
2649,"The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds, on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases"
2650,They sat well back and gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high altar
2651,"A powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped with a white surplice, was observed to be struggling up into the pulpit"
2652,"The priest’s figure now stood upright in the pulpit, two-thirds of its bulk, crowned by a massive red face, appearing above the balustrade"
2653,"Father Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light and, covering his face with his hands, prayed"
2654,His glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat
2655,"Her face, healthier than her sister’s, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour"
2656,"“He’s really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom’s eyes at night and making him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout"
2657,"A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her hands and crying:"
2658,"A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl"
2659,"His mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes’ heads upon it, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons"
2660,"She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes"
2661,She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair
2662,"A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef"
2663,"two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow;"
2664,"a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks"
2665,"On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes"
2666,While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin
2667,“Is it because he’s only a black?”
2668,"Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam"
2669,She herself said that it was not quite brown enough
2670,"“Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,” said Mr Browne, “that I’m brown enough for you because, you know, I’m all brown"
2671,The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres
2672,He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap
2673,He could not see her face but he could see the terracotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white
2674,Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones
2675,A dull yellow light brooded over the houses and the river;
2676,"She was walking on before him with Mr Bartell D’Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush"
2677,“They say you never cross O’Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse
2678,"“I see a white man this time,” said Gabriel"
2679,"If I went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye, which is the noblest feature of the face, not purple but black, he would reply:"
2680,"' 'Now I can well imagine a fool's paradise, in which everybody is eating and drinking, clothed in purple and fine linen, and potters lie on sofas and have their wheel at hand, that they may work a little when they please;"
2681,You know the way in which dyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple or of any other colour
2682,'The preparation of the Gospel of peace' soon becomes the red flag of Republicanism
2683,"One who deserved to be called a man of genius, a friend of my youth, was in the habit of wearing a black ribbon on his wrist, in order to remind him that, being liable to outbreaks of insanity, he must not give way to the natural impulses of affection:"
2684,"to whom the black earth brings forth Wheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit, And his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish"
2685,"You know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the true sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first;"
2686,"this they prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white ground may take the purple hue in full perfection"
2687,"But, when the ground has not been duly prepared, you will have noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour"
2688,"Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin—it makes no difference;"
2689,"they, not knowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain, which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white—can you wonder, I say, at this?"
2690,"these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis and Clotho and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens—Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos of the future;"
2691,"Think, also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates!"
2692,"I have watered the red huckleberry, the sand cherry and the nettle tree, the red pine and the black ash, the white grape and the yellow violet, which might have withered else in dry seasons"
2693,"“What!” exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, “do you mean to starve us?” Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off,—that the lawyer had only to weave arguments, and by some magic, wealth and standing followed, he had said to himself;"
2694,"Thinking that when he had made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be the white man’s to buy them"
2695,"Or I could refer you to Ireland, which is marked as one of the white or enlightened spots on the map"
2696,"floor this cellar with plank, and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling, raise a roof of spars clear up, and cover the spars with bark or green sods, so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with their entire families for two, three, and four years, it being understood that partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to the size of the family"
2697,"In such a neighborhood as this, boards and shingles, lime and bricks, are cheaper and more easily obtained than suitable caves, or whole logs, or bark in sufficient quantities, or even well-tempered clay or flat stones"
2698,"Near the end of March, , I borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house, and began to cut down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their youth, for timber"
2699,"but for the most part when I came out on to the railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the spring sun, and I heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence another year with us"
2700,"One day, when my axe had come off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with a stone, and had placed the whole to soak in a pond hole in order to swell the wood, I saw a striped snake run into the water, and he lay on the bottom, apparently without inconvenience, as long as I stayed there, or more than a quarter of an hour;"
2701,"yet I usually carried my dinner of bread and butter, and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped, at noon, sitting amid the green pine boughs which I had cut off, and to my bread was imparted some of their fragrance, for my hands were covered with a thick coat of pitch"
2702,The yellow corn and turnips were too late to come to any thing
2703,"The expense of food for eight months, namely, from July th to March st, the time when these estimates were made, though I lived there more than two years,—not counting potatoes, a little green corn, and some peas, which I had raised, nor considering the value of what was on hand at the last date, was"
2704,"And pray what more can a reasonable man desire, in peaceful times, in ordinary noons, than a sufficient number of ears of green sweet-corn boiled, with the addition of salt?"
2705,"Being a microcosm himself, he discovers, and it is a true discovery, and he is the man to make it,—that the world has been eating green apples;"
2706,"to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great green apple, which there is danger awful to think of that the children of men will nibble before it is ripe;"
2707,"the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant;"
2708,"but above all, the recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the house-dog bark"
2709,"The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them"
2710,"That way I looked between and over the near green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue"
2711,"When my floor was dirty, I rose early, and, setting all my furniture out of doors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but one budget, dashed water on the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it, and then with a broom scrubbed it clean and white;"
2712,"The large buds, suddenly pushing out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead, developed themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs, an inch in diameter;"
2713,"the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by twos and threes athwart my view, or perching restless on the white-pine boughs behind my house, gives a voice to the air;"
2714,"sighs one on this side of the pond, and circles with the restlessness of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks"
2715,"Not even rats in the wall, for they were starved out, or rather were never baited in,—only squirrels on the roof and under the floor, a whippoorwill on the ridge pole, a blue-jay screaming beneath the window, a hare or woodchuck under the house, a screech-owl or a cat-owl behind it, a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox to bark in the night"
2716,"When I return to my house I find that visitors have been there and left their cards, either a bunch of flowers, or a wreath of evergreen, or a name in pencil on a yellow walnut leaf or a chip"
2717,"unless it were in the spring, when at long intervals some came from the village to fish for pouts,—they plainly fished much more in the Walden Pond of their own natures, and baited their hooks with darkness,—but they soon retreated, usually with light baskets, and left “the world to darkness and to me,” and the black kernel of the night was never profaned by any human neighborhood"
2718,There can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of Nature and has his senses still
2719,"And yet it has not the blue devils, but the blue angels in it, in the azure tint of its waters"
2720,"For my panacea, instead of one of those quack vials of a mixture dipped from Acheron and the Dead Sea, which come out of those long shallow black-schooner looking wagons which we sometimes see made to carry bottles, let me have a draught of undiluted morning air"
2721,I should be proud to have for the motto of my cabin those lines of Spenser which one of my visitors inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card:—
2722,"” He has a great bundle of white-oak bark under his arm for a sick man, gathered this Sunday morning"
2723,"a stout but sluggish body, yet gracefully carried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue eyes, which were occasionally lit up with expression"
2724,"He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored greatcoat, and cowhide boots"
2725,"but in the course of the summer it appeared by the arrowheads which I turned up in hoeing, that an extinct nation had anciently dwelt here and planted corn and beans ere white men came to clear the land, and so, to some extent, had exhausted the soil for this very crop"
2726,"There the sun lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and forward over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows, fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where I could rest in the shade, the other in a blackberry field where the green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another bout"
2727,"Removing the weeds, putting fresh soil about the bean stems, and encouraging this weed which I had sown, making the yellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass, making the earth say beans instead of grass,—this was my daily work"
2728,” “Does he live there?” asks the black bonnet of the gray coat;
2729,"Near at hand, upon the topmost spray of a birch, sings the brown-thrasher—or red mavis, as some love to call him—all the morning, glad of your society, that would find out another farmer’s field if yours were not here"
2730,"That’s Roman wormwood,—that’s pigweed,—that’s sorrel,—that’s piper-grass,—have at him, chop him up, turn his roots upward to the sun, don’t let him have a fibre in the shade, if you do he’ll turn himself t’other side up and be as green as a leek in two days"
2731,"Plant the common small white bush bean about the first of June, in rows three feet by eighteen inches apart, being careful to select fresh round and unmixed seed"
2732,"It is a clear and deep green well, half a mile long and a mile and three quarters in circumference, and contains about sixty-one and a half acres;"
2733,"In clear weather, in summer, they appear blue at a little distance, especially if agitated, and at a great distance all appear alike"
2734,"The sea, however, is said to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible change in the atmosphere"
2735,"I have seen our river, when, the landscape being covered with snow, both water and ice were almost as green as grass"
2736,"Some consider blue “to be the color of pure water, whether liquid or solid"
2737,"Walden is blue at one time and green at another, even from the same point of view"
2738,"but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the sand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in the body of the pond"
2739,"In some lights, viewed even from a hill-top, it is of a vivid green next the shore"
2740,"but it is equally green there against the railroad sand-bank, and in the spring, before the leaves are expanded, and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand"
2741,"Like the rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear weather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the right angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it appears at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself;"
2742,"and at such a time, being on its surface, and looking with divided vision, so as to see the reflection, I have discerned a matchless and indescribable light blue, such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades suggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves, which last appeared but muddy in comparison"
2743,"It is well known that a large plate of glass will have a green tint, owing, as the makers say, to its “body,” but a small piece of the same will be colorless"
2744,How large a body of Walden water would be required to reflect a green tint I have never proved
2745,"The water of our river is black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it, and, like that of most ponds, imparts to the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge;"
2746,"The shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like paving stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your head;"
2747,"and of noticeable plants, except in the little meadows recently overflowed, which do not properly belong to it, a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a bulrush, nor even a lily, yellow or white, but only a few small heart-leaves and potamogetons, and perhaps a water-target or two;"
2748,"The stones extend a rod or two into the water, and then the bottom is pure sand, except in the deepest parts, where there is usually a little sediment, probably from the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many successive falls, and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even in midwinter"
2749,"Successive nations perchance have drank at, admired, and fathomed it, and passed away, and still its water is green and pellucid as ever"
2750,"This is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of the pond in winter, just after a light snow has fallen, appearing as a clear undulating white line, unobscured by weeds and twigs, and very obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is hardly distinguishable close at hand"
2751,"The snow reprints it, as it were, in clear white type alto-relievo"
2752,"When the water is at its height, the alders, willows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water, and to the height of three or four feet from the ground, in the effort to maintain themselves;"
2753,"and another, golden-colored, and shaped like the last, but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots, intermixed with a few faint blood-red ones, very much like a trout"
2754,"Ducks and geese frequent it in the spring and fall, the white-bellied swallows (Hirundo bicolor) skim over it, and the peetweets (Totanus macularius) “teter” along its stony shores all summer"
2755,I have sometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on a white-pine over the water;
2756,"Paddling gently to one of these places, I was surprised to find myself surrounded by myriads of small perch, about five inches long, of a rich bronze color in the green water, sporting there, and constantly rising to the surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on it"
2757,"At length the wind rose, the mist increased, and the waves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher than before, half out of water, a hundred black points, three inches long, at once above the surface"
2758,"It was made of two white-pine logs dug out and pinned together, and was cut off square at the ends"
2759,"About fifteen years ago you could see the top of a pitch-pine, of the kind called yellow-pine hereabouts, though it is not a distinct species, projecting above the surface in deep water, many rods from the shore"
2760,"It was in the winter, and he had been getting out ice in the forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid of his neighbors, he would take out the old yellow-pine"
2761,"Instead of the white lily, which requires mud, or the common sweet flag, the blue flag (Iris versicolor) grows thinly in the pure water, rising from the stony bottom all around the shore, where it is visited by humming birds in June;"
2762,"Sometimes I rambled to pine groves, standing like temples, or like fleets at sea, full-rigged, with wavy boughs, and rippling with light, so soft and green and shady that the Druids would have forsaken their oaks to worship in them;"
2763,"or to the cedar wood beyond Flint’s Pond, where the trees, covered with hoary blue berries, spiring higher and higher, are fit to stand before Valhalla, and the creeping juniper covers the ground with wreaths full of fruit;"
2764,"or to swamps where the usnea lichen hangs in festoons from the white-spruce trees, and toad-stools, round tables of the swamp gods, cover the ground, and more beautiful fungi adorn the stumps, like butterflies or shells, vegetable winkles;"
2765,"where the swamp-pink and dogwood grow, the red alder-berry glows like eyes of imps, the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardest woods in its folds, and the wild-holly berries make the beholder forget his home with their beauty, and he is dazzled and tempted by nameless other wild forbidden fruits, too fair for mortal taste"
2766,"such as the black-birch, of which we have some handsome specimens two feet in diameter;"
2767,"its cousin, the yellow birch, with its loose golden vest, perfumed like the first;"
2768,A puritan may go to his brown-bread crust with as gross an appetite as ever an alderman to his turtle
2769,"The other day I picked up the lower jaw of a hog, with white and sound teeth and tusks, which suggested that there was an animal health and vigor distinct from the spiritual"
2770,"I have water from the spring, and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf"
2771,My brown bread will soon be gone
2772,"There, in a very secluded and shaded spot, under a spreading white-pine, there was yet a clean, firm sward to sit on"
2773,"I had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful without roiling it, and thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when the pond was warmest"
2774,"There too the turtle-doves sat over the spring, or fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white-pines over my head;"
2775,"or the red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly familiar and inquisitive"
2776,"Looking farther, I was surprised to find that the chips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a duellum, but a bellum, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted against the black, and frequently two red ones to one black"
2777,"The legions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my wood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying, both red and black"
2778,"the red republicans on the one hand, and the black imperialists on the other"
2779,"The smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his adversary’s front, and through all the tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root, having already caused the other to go by the board;"
2780,"while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw on looking nearer, had already divested him of several of his members"
2781,"In the mean while there came along a single red ant on the hill-side of this valley, evidently full of excitement, who either had despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle;"
2782,"then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon the black warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore-leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members;"
2783,"Holding a microscope to the first-mentioned red ant, I saw that, though he was assiduously gnawing at the near fore-leg of his enemy, having severed his remaining feeler, his own breast was all torn away, exposing what vitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior, whose breastplate was apparently too thick for him to pierce;"
2784,"They struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler, and when I looked again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their bodies, and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him like ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow, still apparently as firmly fastened as ever, and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles, being without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg, and I know not how many other wounds, to divest himself of them;"
2785,"that she was of a dark brownish-gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet, and had a large bushy tail like a fox;"
2786,Did not his white breast enough betray him?
2787,"His white breast, the stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were all against him"
2788,"When compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see to other ponds and the river, like black motes in the sky;"
2789,"It was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of Lincoln,—they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad,—with a bag on my shoulder, and a stick to open burrs with in my hand, for I did not always wait for the frost, amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red-squirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts I sometimes stole, for the burrs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones"
2790,I had often since seen its crimpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the same
2791,"Already, by the first of September, I had seen two or three small maples turned scarlet across the pond, beneath where the white stems of three aspens diverged, at the point of a promontory, next the water"
2792,"As my bricks had been in a chimney before, though I did not read the name of Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out as many fire-place bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I filled the spaces between the bricks about the fire-place with stones from the pond shore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place"
2793,"Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and rafters with the bark on high overhead"
2794,"I had the previous winter made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the Unio fluviatilis, which our river affords, for the sake of the experiment;"
2795,"and, for wrecks, it is strewn with the cases of cadis worms made of minute grains of white quartz"
2796,"I sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the ice, and those which broke through carried in air with them, which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath"
2797,"But as the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the ice was not now transparent, showing the dark green color of the water, and the bottom, but opaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than before, for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run together, and lost their regularity;"
2798,"With axe and shovel you explore this mine, and follow the marrowy store, yellow as beef tallow, or as if you had struck on a vein of gold, deep into the earth"
2799,"Hard green wood just cut, though I used but little of that, answered my purpose better than any other"
2800,"The moles nested in my cellar, nibbling every third potato, and making a snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown paper;"
2801,"One black chicken which the administrator could not catch, black as night and as silent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still went to roost in the next apartment"
2802,"some pitch-pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook, and a sweet-scented black-birch, perhaps, waves where the door-stone was"
2803,"But no weather interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my going abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree, or a yellow-birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines;"
2804,"One afternoon I amused myself by watching a barred owl (Strix nebulosa) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white-pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within a rod of him"
2805,"A blue-robed man, whose fittest roof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity"
2806,"Usually the red squirrel (Sciurus Hudsonius) waked me in the dawn, coursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house, as if sent out of the woods for this purpose"
2807,"All day long the red squirrels came and went, and afforded me much entertainment by their manœuvres"
2808,"They are not green like the pines, nor gray like the stones, nor blue like the sky;"
2809,At first it looked like a vast blue fort or Valhalla;
2810,"Like the water, the Walden ice, seen near at hand, has a green tint, but at a distance is beautifully blue, and you can easily tell it from the white ice of the river, or the merely greenish ice of some ponds, a quarter of a mile off"
2811,"I have noticed that a portion of Walden which in the state of water was green will often, when frozen, appear from the same point of view blue"
2812,"Perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the light and air they contain, and the most transparent is the bluest"
2813,"When a warm rain in the middle of the winter melts off the snow-ice from Walden, and leaves a hard dark or transparent ice on the middle, there will be a strip of rotten though thicker white ice, a rod or more wide, about the shores, created by this reflected heat"
2814,"On the th of March, after I had heard the bluebird, song-sparrow, and red-wing, the ice was still nearly a foot thick"
2815,"At length the sun’s rays have attained the right angle, and warm winds blow up mist and rain and melt the snow banks, and the sun dispersing the mist smiles on a checkered landscape of russet and white smoking with incense, through which the traveller picks his way from islet to islet, cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearing off"
2816,"It precedes the green and flowery spring, as mythology precedes regular poetry"
2817,"At the approach of spring the red-squirrels got under my house, two at a time, directly under my feet as I sat reading or writing, and kept up the queerest chuckling and chirruping and vocal pirouetting and gurgling sounds that ever were heard;"
2818,"The faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and moist fields from the blue-bird, the song-sparrow, and the red-wing, as if the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell!"
2819,"not yellow but green is the color of its flame;—the symbol of perpetual youth, the grass-blade, like a long green ribbon, streams from the sod into the summer, checked indeed by the frost, but anon pushing on again, lifting its spear of last year’s hay with the fresh life below"
2820,"It is almost identical with that, for in the growing days of June, when the rills are dry, the grass blades are their channels, and from year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream, and the mower draws from it betimes their winter supply"
2821,"So our human life but dies down to its root, and still puts forth its green blade to eternity"

2826,Is not our own interior white on the chart?
2827,"black though it may prove, like the coast, when discovered"
2828,"Southern customers objected to its blue color, which is the evidence of its purity, as if it were muddy, and preferred the Cambridge ice, which is white, but tastes of weeds"
2829,"Shall we with pains erect a heaven of blue glass over ourselves, though when it is done we shall be sure to gaze still at the true ethereal heaven far above, as if the former were not?"
2830,"Who knows what beautiful and winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society, deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree, which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned tomb,—heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished family of man, as they sat round the festive board,—may unexpectedly come forth from amidst society’s most trivial and handselled furniture, to enjoy its perfect summer life at last!"
2831,"Visit the Navy Yard, and behold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, or such as it can make a man with its black arts, a mere shadow and reminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and already, as one may say, buried under arms with funeral accompaniment, though it may be"

2834,"When I came out of prison,—for some one interfered, and paid the tax,—I did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common, such as he observed who went in a youth, and emerged a gray-headed man;"
2835,but it was a black morning's work for her
2836,"She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance"
2837,"Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions"
2838,"She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate;"
2839,"and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,"
2840,"“Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much"
2841,"and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time"
2842,I am sure I must have been as white as my gown

2849,"Here,—probably this basket with pink ribbon"
2850,but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare
2851,"Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk"
2852,The black mare was blameless;
2853,"—The first, was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself—and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!—(Harriet could not recall it without a blush"
2854,"and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,"

2879,He turned his angry white moustache
2880,"And snug in their spooncase of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles:"

3078,"Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her again"
3079,It was dark brown with a natural wave in it
3080,A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the Lady’s Pictorial that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection
3081,"She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn’t of a Friday"
3082,(because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be
3083,The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips
3084,"Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November"
3085,"Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses"
3086,"He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes"
3087,"But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please"
3088,For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White
3089,"Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking"
3090,"And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk"
3091,You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose
3092,"It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window"
3093,She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat
3094,She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant
3095,Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball
3096,A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle
3097,"Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down"
3098,He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic
3099,He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’ adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place
3100,Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears
3101,"Miss puny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it"
3102,"It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs"
3103,"The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes"
3104,"And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple"
3105,"And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark"
3106,"And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking"
3107,"She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages"
3108,Why I bought her the violet garters

3115,"A last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer’s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars"
3116,"He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake"
3117,"Her blue scarf loose, laughing"
3118,She had red slippers on
3119,O sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair heave under embon señorita young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan Winkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail end Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next her next
3120,"Watchers tway there walk, white sisters in ward sleepless"
3121,And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously
3122,"Ruth red him, love led on with will to wander, loth to leave"
3123,"Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she to be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with burning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided"
3124,"A black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back"
3125,The rosy buds all gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag and faggots that would catch at first fire
3126,"In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke’s lawn, thence through Merrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was before bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but no more crack after that first"
3127,"Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now on the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put to it and can’t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her soon issue"
3128,"Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself (for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying:"

3310,Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters / per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come or times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for £ for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they
3311,theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give points in to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods Ave Maria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the big poppies because mine was the th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was / after when I saw the Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him or tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G th Bn nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line / obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about /- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the years more I have of life up to no Im what am I at all Ill be in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a—e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were
3312,yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was of the wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday

get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her

he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only his letter and the card from Milly

fellow that was something in the four courts that jilted her after out of the ladies letterwriter when I told her to say a few simple words he could twist how he liked not acting with precipat precipitancy with equal candour the greatest earthly happiness answer to a gentlemans proposal affirmatively my goodness theres nothing else its all very fine for them but as for being a woman as soon

3314,Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near or a her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the dear

3315,that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave /- each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us days every or weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore
3316,who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself and times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying /- in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats years ago now yes hed be though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the th card after that the of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the queens and the of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and red s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait I was married Milly is yesterday what age was he then at Dillons or about I suppose hes or more Im not too old for him if hes or I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in / a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though
3317,no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for he can make it for Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only / or / Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him or times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want £ or perhaps /- Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent or questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day

I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at /d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes
3318,"She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling’s friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael’s pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s hair"
3319,"and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star"
3320,"Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown"
3321,"she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel"
3322,"Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win"
3323,"In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence"
3324,That gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo
3325,"In person he was cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance"
3326,"His eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly"
3327,It was a black voice
3328,"“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth, “and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it"
3329,“A great white bird
3330,"“I wish I had a pretty house, The littlest ever seen, With funny little red walls And roof of mossy green"
3331,"They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted with moss"
3332,"With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves were the blinds"
3333,"“Brimstone and gall,” thundered Hook, “what cozening is going on here!” His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they believed their words, and he was startled"
3334,"no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him"
3335,"There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected"
3336,"“The great white father,” he would say to them in a very lordly manner, as they grovelled at his feet, “is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates"
3337,"“I wish he had been a white rat,” said Nibs"
3338,"a sure proof that the unscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly is beyond the wit of the white man"
3339,"The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water"
3340,"Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade"
3341,"The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter"
3342,"He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to Bill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate"
3343,and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope into nine equal pieces
3344,"Slightly, white to the gills, knew that Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need stick"
3345,Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle
3346,The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’s medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach
3347,"These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence"
3348,"One green light squinting over Kidd’s Creek, which is near the mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, the Jolly Roger, lay, low in the water;"
3349,"They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing the fatal plank"
3350,"“The cabin’s as black as a pit,” Cecco said, almost gibbering, “but there is something terrible in there:"
3351,"As he backed up Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye"
3352,"and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are"
3353,Wendy was married in white with a pink sash
3354,and in the dim light her white dress might have been the nightgown in which he had seen her first
3355,"The walls are cracked and water runs upon them in thin threads without sound, black and glistening as blood"
3356,"There is green mould in the grooves of the letters and yellow streaks on the marble, which come from more years than men could count"
3357,The sleeping halls there were white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds
3358,The sleeping halls were white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds
3359,Their hair was white and their faces were cracked as the clay of a dry river bed
3360,And we saw no breath to stir the folds of their white togas
3361,"And we looked straight into the eyes of the Council, but their eyes were as cold blue glass buttons"
3362,The sky is green and cold in our windows to the east
3363,"In five hours, the shadows are blue on the pavements, and the sky is blue with a deep brightness which is not bright"
3364,The sky is a soggy purple when we return to the Home
3365,"The sky is like a black sieve pierced by silver drops that tremble, ready to burst through"
3366,The sleeping halls are white and clean and bare of all things save one hundred beds
3367,"Of a sudden the earth fell in before us, and we saw an old iron grill over a black hole"
3368,"The fire flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the walls, and there is no sound of men to disturb us"
3369,"The fields are black and ploughed, and they lie like a great fan before us, with their furrows gathered in some hand beyond the sky, spreading forth from that hand, opening wide apart as they come toward us, like black pleats that sparkle with thin, green spangles"
3370,"Women work in the fields, and their white tunics in the wind are like the wings of sea-gulls beating over the black soil"
3371,"Thus we learned their name, and we stood watching them go, till their white tunic was lost in the blue mist"
3372,"Their head fell back, and their arms fell, as if their arms and their thin white neck were stricken suddenly with a great lassitude"
3373,"Then the Golden One saw us, and they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and circles of light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water of the moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their hand held as frozen in the air"
3374,"So we looked straight upon the Golden One, and we saw the shadows of their lashes on their white cheeks and the sparks of sun on their lips"
3375,"And beyond the City there lies the plain, and beyond the plain, black upon the black sky, there lies the Uncharted Forest"
3376,But ever do our eyes return to that black patch upon the sky
3377,They had hair of gold and eyes blue as morning
3378,"But then came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun had burst and spread its flame in the air, and the fields lay still without breath, and the dust of the road was white in the glow"
3379,"We stretched our hands to the wire, and we saw our fingers in the red glow"
3380,"We could not see our body nor feel it, and in that moment nothing existed save our two hands over a wire glowing in a black abyss"
3381,"A flaming grill kept dancing before our eyes, and we thought of nothing save that grill, a grill, a grill of red squares, and then we knew that we were looking at the squares of the iron grill in the door, and there were also the squares of stone on the walls, and the squares which the lash was cutting upon our back, crossing and re-crossing itself in our flesh"
3382,"It knocked our chin up, and we saw the red froth of our mouth on the withered fingers, and the Judge asked:"
3383,"We wondered who was sprinkling burning coal dust upon the floor, for we saw drops of red twinkling on the stones around us"
3384,"They stood before us in their white togas, and they asked:"
3385,"The leaves rustle over our head, black against the last gold of the sky"
3386,"We saw nothing as we entered, save the sky in the great windows, blue and glowing"
3387,It is true that our tunic was torn and stained with brown stains which had been blood
3388,"And slowly, slowly as a flush of blood, a red flame trembled in the wire"
3389,The leaves had edges of silver that trembled and rippled like a river of green and fire flowing high above us
3390,"We went on, cutting through the branches, and it was as if we were swimming through a sea of leaves, with the bushes as waves rising and falling and rising around us, and flinging their green sprays high to the treetops"
3391,"For, upon the blue of the sky below us, we saw our own face for the first time"
3392,"And then we saw the fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a gleam of gold"
3393,"Their white tunic was torn, and the branches had cut the skin of their arms, but they spoke as if they had never taken notice of it, nor of weariness, nor of fear"
3394,"We can see their eyes, green and yellow as coals, watching us from the tree branches beyond"
3395,"The fires smoulder as a crown of jewels around us, and smoke stands still in the air, in columns made blue by the moonlight"
3396,"The skin of their arms is like a blue mist, but their shoulders are white and glowing, as if the light fell not from above, but rose from under their skin"
3397,"The peaks were red and brown, with the green streaks of forests as veins upon them, with blue mists as veils over their heads"
3398,"Then today, at sunrise, we saw a white flame among the trees, high on a sheer peak before us"
3399,"And there, before us, on a broad summit, with the mountains rising behind it, stood a house such as we had never seen, and the white fire came from the sun on the glass of its windows"
3400,"The sunrays danced upon colors, colors, more colors than we thought possible, we who had seen no houses save the white ones, the brown ones and the grey"
3401,"For they were not white tunics, nor white togas;"
3402,"The word “We” is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens to stone, and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and that which is black are lost equally in the grey of it"
3403,I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script
3404,"‘But I have seen more than that,’ said he, ‘for Hugo Baskerville passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels"
3405,"But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle"
3406,"But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon"
3407,I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive
3408,"The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family"
3409,"He made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died there in of yellow fever"
3410,Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips
3411,"The latter was a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face"
3412,Among other things I bought these brown boots—gave six dollars for them—and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet
3413,” His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke
3414,At that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of piercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab
3415,“There now!” said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with vexation from the tide of vehicles
3416,"“But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?”"
3417,And now it’s an old black one
3418,"Last night they took one of my brown ones, and today they have sneaked one of the black"
3419,"Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is a man with a full, black beard"
3420,"We had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry of triumph, and diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from under a cabinet"
3421,"Setting aside the whole grim story of Sir Charles’s death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within the limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed letter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown boot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new brown boot"
3422,"He was dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end, and a pale face"
3423,"In a very few hours the brown earth had become ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in well-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate"
3424,"Over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in a dream"
3425,"Outside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs was waiting"
3426,"The coachman, a hard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in a few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road"
3427,"Rolling pasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses peeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful and sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky, the long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister hills"
3428,"We looked back on it now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of gold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad tangle of the woodlands"
3429,"The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of rafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles’s South African gold"
3430,To right and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite
3431,"A dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke"
3432,The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow light of the hall
3433,"The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed down the walls and hung like a black canopy above him"
3434,"He was a remarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and pale, distinguished features"
3435,I seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler’s white face
3436,"but now, when two black-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a shaded lamp, one’s voice became hushed and one’s spirit subdued"
3437,But her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between swollen lids
3438,"Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded man there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom"
3439,A tin box for botanical specimens hung over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his hands
3440,"“It is a wonderful place, the moor,” said he, looking round over the undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite foaming up into fantastic surges"
3441,You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly over it?”
3442,Something brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges
3443,"I looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes"
3444,"To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the air"
3445,"Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track"
3446,"We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass"
3447,It is a white wooden gate with a latch
3448,"He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric"
3449,A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor
3450,"A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground"
3451,"He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury"
3452,"We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded figure, his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage"
3453,"Then he passed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle framed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the gloom of the corridor"
3454,"His dark eyes, glaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and astonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me"
3455,"Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the trees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the clouds"
3456,"And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pinpoint of yellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily in the centre of the black square framed by the window"
3457,Far away in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow light
3458,The baronet caught my sleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness
3459,"We stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front"
3460,"It was strange to see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with no sign of life near it—just the one straight yellow flame and the gleam of the rock on each side of it"
3461,"Over the rocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out an evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with vile passions"
3462,"There, outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the tor"
3463,The baronet is in a black reaction after the excitements of the night
3464,"The greater part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was grey on a black ground"
3465,"I found the black tor upon which I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs"
3466,"“There’s foul play somewhere, and there’s black villainy brewing, to that I’ll swear!"
3467,"” When the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked through a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline of the wind-swept trees"
3468,"Her eyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though considerably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the brunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose"
3469,"And the messenger of good fortune was none other than Mr. Frankland, who was standing, grey-whiskered and red-faced, outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the highroad along which I travelled"
3470,"“It is a great day for me, sir—one of the red-letter days of my life,” he cried with many chuckles"
3471,"It was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot against the dull green and grey"
3472,When he reached the crest I saw the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue sky
3473,"One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven"
3474,The last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor
3475,A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky
3476,"Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the darkness"
3477,"Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light was shining"
3478,"Together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones"
3479,"The tragedy was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country"
3480,"A figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar"
3481,"Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end"
3482,"That’s a Kneller, I’ll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds"
3483,"The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William Baskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons under Pitt"
3484,“And this Cavalier opposite to me—the one with the black velvet and the lace?”
3485,"I looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace collar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them"
3486,"Her hands were grasping the arms of her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of her grip"
3487,"I have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white fog"
3488,Every minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor was drifting closer and closer to the house
3489,"The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour"
3490,"So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were half a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the moon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on"
3491,"With long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track, following hard upon the footsteps of our friend"
3492,"Far away on the path we saw Sir Henry looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in horror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him down"
3493,As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear red weal of a whiplash across her neck
3494,The fog-bank lay like white wool against the window
3495,From the end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits and foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger
3496,He held an old black boot in the air
3497,A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the débris
3498,"I said it in London, Watson, and I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a more dangerous man than he who is lying yonder”—he swept his long arm towards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched away until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor"
3499,"In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a dreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim"
3500,"In doing so I held it within a few inches of my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine"
3501,"There seemed to be no alternative but to catch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and apparently unprotected, as a bait"
3502,"His love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her"
3503,"“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it’s black"
3504,"“Why, I did sew it with white!"
3505,"In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle carried white thread and the other black"
3506,"His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons"
3507,"Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting"
3508,I’ll give you a white alley!”
3509,"He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound"
3510,"He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash"
3511,Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety
3512,"When she found the entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable"
3513,"His soul was at peace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble"
3514,"As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered pan-talettes"
3515,"But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end"
3516,"Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones"
3517,"However, they worried through, and each got his reward—in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it;"
3518,each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation
3519,"Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it;"
3520,ten red tickets equalled a yellow one;
3521,for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil
3522,"Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough—he had been around among the star pupils inquiring"
3523,"And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible"
3524,"His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on Sundays—accidentally"
3525,"It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it"
3526,"By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill"
3527,“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house
3528,“Where’d you get the blue ticket?”
3529,"Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love;"
3530,"Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance;"
3531,"Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little white apron to her face"
3532,Tom kissed the red lips and said:
3533,"How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore!"
3534,"And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!—the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main!”"
3535,"The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright"
3536,Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest
3537,"and finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more"
3538,then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and “the yellow stains of it came through his pores”—as Tom said
3539,"One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt’s yellow cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging for a taste"
3540,"It was the cool gray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods"
3541,"A white layer of ashes covered the fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air"
3542,"Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself"
3543,"A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again—for he was measuring, Tom said;"
3544,"A brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and said, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your children’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it—which did not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once"
3545,"then a shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity;"
3546,"a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not"
3547,"Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar"
3548,"Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat’s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again"
3549,"He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed to suit him"
3550,They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut
3551,"And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time"
3552,“That was the day after I lost a white alley
3553,"the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain"
3554,"so it was not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many zebras—all of them chiefs, of course—and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement"
3555,Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins
3556,"“Rebecca Thatcher” Tom glanced at her face—it was white with terror—“did you tear—no, look me in the face” her hands rose in appeal—“did you tear this book?”"
3557,"snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair"
3558,"Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:"
3559,the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order
3560,and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks—a paper that’s got to be ciphered over about a week because it’s mostly signs and hy’roglyphics
3561,"“I’m going to buy a new drum, and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup, and get married"
3562,"“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular ghosts"
3563,"“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom, you can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it"
3564,"The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window;"
3565,he had bushy white whiskers;
3566,"long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles"
3567,It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun
3568,"so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a rusty, ragged-looking devil"
3569,"When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don’t take that sort of revenge"
3570,"“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded—you ain’t well a bit—no wonder you’re a little flighty and off your balance"
3571,"Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white"
3572,and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight;
3573,Tom turned as white as a sheet
3574,But do you see that white place up yonder where there’s been a landslide?
3575,Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said:
3576,"He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name"
3577,"The floor was of smooth, white stone;"
3578,one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade
3579,"I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth watering for a snatch"
3580,"On that bleak hill top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me shiver through every limb"
3581,"“Were you asked to tea?” she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot"
3582,"her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child’s ready to cry"
3583,"his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer:"
3584,"“Half an hour?” he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes;"
3585,The red cow didn’t die by chance;
3586,"but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres—the air swarmed with Catherines;"
3587,"I saw a red ornamented title—“Seventy Times Seven, and the First of the Seventy-First"
3588,"with a candle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall behind him"
3589,"It was well he did, for the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean;"
3590,"these were erected and daubed with lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also when a fall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on either hand with the firmer path:"
3591,"We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy’s head I had a peep at a dirty, ragged, black-haired child;"
3592,"and if you won’t I shall tell your father of the three thrashings you’ve given me this week, and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder"
3593,and that humouring was rich nourishment to the child’s pride and black tempers
3594,"but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and delf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort, and so dropped the intention"
3595,"it was beautiful—a splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with little soft tapers"
3596,"Isabella—I believe she is eleven, a year younger than Cathy—lay screaming at the farther end of the room, shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her"
3597,"his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver"
3598,and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons—a dim reflection from her own enchanting face
3599,"so that, instead of a wild, hatless little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all breathless, there “lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in"
3600,"I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes;"
3601,"she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh, exclaiming, “Why, how very black and cross you look!"
3602,"and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like devil’s spies?"
3603,"“In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton’s great blue eyes and even forehead,” he replied"
3604,"Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour into their white faces"
3605,"where, doubtless, he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless"
3606,“Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags;
3607,"“I didn’t touch you, you lying creature!” cried she, her fingers tingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage"
3608,"“What’s that, then?” I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to refute her"
3609,“it has been cutting red herrings
3610,Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike this—as black as t’ chimbley!
3611,"the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with black whiskers;"
3612,"They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen)"
3613,"A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued;"
3614,"I never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella’s yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the family exhibit for her"
3615,"she grew white and red in rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine;"
3616,"the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or two:"
3617,"The sun shone yellow on its grey head, reminding me of summer;"
3618,"That was my first idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars"
3619,"Fit to cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him"
3620,"I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate"
3621,“God forbid that he should try!” answered the black villain
3622,"and I’m conscious it’s night, and there are two candles on the table making the black press shine like jet"
3623,“The black press?
3624,"In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly, evidently by another agent than the wind"
3625,“and I only see two white spots on the whole range of moors:
3626,"Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual"
3627,"Her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye;"
3628,"and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition, that on his letting go I saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin"
3629,"Heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, replacing them by a black lock of his own"
3630,"It was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor;"
3631,"add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself through fatigue;"
3632,Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head
3633,"and God, when addressed, was curiously confounded with his own black father!"
3634,"As I sat nursing these reflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow from the latter individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly through"
3635,"Hindley has exactly her eyes, if you had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red;"
3636,"a real beauty in face, with the Earnshaws’ handsome dark eyes, but the Lintons’ fair skin and small features, and yellow curling hair"
3637,and deep into summer I have found snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!”
3638,Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech
3639,and now attired in her new black frock—poor thing!
3640,Linton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study
3641,"and you can bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study;"
3642,"“but he has black hair and eyes, and looks sterner;"
3643,"not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large languid eyes—his mother’s eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit"
3644,"during which examination Linton ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector"
3645,Though it is something to see you have not white blood
3646,"but she reappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued in outward aspect"
3647,"On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November—a fresh watery afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds—dark grey streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain—I requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of showers"
3648,"“No,” she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage;"
3649,"the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rose-bushes and black-berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending"
3650,There are only a few red ashes now
3651,"I hate you now!” she panted, and her face grew red with passion"
3652,"He said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead, and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly"
3653,"mine was rocking in a rustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above;"
3654,“Linton was white and trembling
3655,"lying, through the long June evenings, on the green mound of her mother’s grave, and wishing—yearning for the time when I might lie beneath it"
3656,"“No—better—better!” he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her;"
3657,her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution
3658,"donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm"
3659,"his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the brows not contracted, but raised next the temples;"
3660,one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes
3661,"so, as soon as she heard Heathcliff’s horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in black, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a Quaker:"
3662,"The ostler at a roadside public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,—“Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah!"
3663,"but the family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear"
3664,"and yet, as is usually the case in a coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney:"
3665,"His handsome features glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of inattention"
3666,"her light, shining ringlets blending, at intervals, with his brown looks, as she bent to superintend his studies;"
3667,"Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white paper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to “Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,” she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey the present to its destined recipient"
3668,"the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph’s eye, and she had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of them"
3669,Heathcliff’s black eyes flashed;
3670,"The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads, and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children;"
3671,"With my hard constitution and temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and probably shall, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair on my head"
3672,"the weather was sweet and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom"
3673,"I was comfortably revelling in the spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr. Heathcliff was coming in"
3674,the same unnatural—it was unnatural—appearance of joy under his black brows;
3675,Those deep black eyes!
3676,"“I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,” I replied, getting a chair and the bellows"
3677,I combed his black long hair from his forehead;
3678,and his parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too!
3679,"Hareton, with a streaming face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself:"
3680,many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass;
3681,You shall be together when the white wings of death scatter your days
3682,"Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments"
3683,"And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all"
3684,And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon
3685,For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together
3686,"And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also"
3687,"Among the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars, sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadows—then let your heart say in silence, “God rests in reason"
3688,"Those who dwelt in Rhodes, distinguished in nations three,—who held Lindus, Ialyssus, and white Camirus, beheld him afar"
3689,"I’ll make thy bones rattle in thee, like three blue beans in a blue bladder"
3690,"The landlady, in the course of her application, perceiving the Knight’s whole body black and blue, observed, that those marks seemed rather the effects of drubbing than of a fall;"
3691,"—Don’t you see that Moor;—hear what a smack he gives on her sweet lips,—and see how she spits, and wipes her mouth with her white smock-sleeve"
3692,"Must I then, when I bid my last farewell to these walks, when I close these lids, and yonder blue regions and all this scene darken upon me and go out;"
3693,"or had agreed, that a little piece of yellow metal, which would keep without wasting or decay, should be worth a great piece of flesh, or a whole heap of corn;"
3694,"All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day"
3695,"” And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast"
3696,"One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat"
3697,"With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna"
3698,"Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red hands;"
3699,"She will be quite ill now,” said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands"
3700,"Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window:"
3701,"Dólokhov’s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides"
3702,"then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner"
3703,"This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life—with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers—was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman"
3704,"Sónya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck"
3705,"He sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair"
3706,"The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings"
3707,"Tall and stout, holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up"
3708,"The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair"
3709,"And there in fact was Sónya lying face downward on Nurse’s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook"
3710,"Natásha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend"
3711,"The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table"
3712,"The quilt of a high, white feather bed was just visible behind a screen"
3713,"The princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her legs, looked directly at Prince Vasíli with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes"
3714,"The part of the room behind the columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening service"
3715,"Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw—covered to the waist by a bright green quilt—the familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bezúkhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face"
3716,"He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment"
3717,"The sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane—which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service"
3718,"His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward"
3719,"Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully glittering eyes"
3720,At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess’ face
3721,"the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father’s further explanations, however clear they might be"
3722,"Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa?"
3723,"The gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince, who was in his large study"
3724,"“The white one, the white one!”"
3725,"When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his son, sat at the table writing"
3726,"What?” asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice"
3727,Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out
3728,"In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray instead of black"
3729,“Why a blue coat?
3730,"Along the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high, light blue Viennese calèche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot"
3731,"Beside Kutúzov sat an Austrian general, in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones"
3732,"“Ah, Timókhin!” said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat"
3733,"The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that Nesvítski could not help laughing"
3734,"Dólokhov, who had already changed into a soldier’s gray greatcoat, did not wait to be called"
3735,"The shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the commander in chief, and presented arms"
3736,"The clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private"
3737,"“And that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were smeared with chalk—as white as flour!"
3738,"In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice"
3739,"But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head, who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door"
3740,"Denísov was a small man with a red face, sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair"
3741,"Puckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair"
3742,"Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rostóv"
3743,"Telyánin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostóv had left him, rubbing his small white hands"
3744,"“Now then, you devil’s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!” shouted Denísov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture"
3745,"Denísov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rostóv"
3746,"Rostóv, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer and then at the other"
3747,"Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops"
3748,"At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges"
3749,"Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along;"
3750,"A woman with an unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds"
3751,"Nesvítski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry, Váska Denísov, red and shaggy, with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder"
3752,"“Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!” shouted Denísov evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face"
3753,"“The squadwon can’t pass,” shouted Váska Denísov, showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him"
3754,"Suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen"
3755,"Rostóv, feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel’s athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red neck"
3756,"Meanwhile Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord, and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side—the blue uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery"
3757,Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out?” These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart—watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns
3758,The infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run
3759,"And fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits"
3760,"The night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day—the day of the battle"
3761,A wax candle stood at each side of the minister’s bent bald head with its gray temples
3762,These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs;
3763,"“It may be treachery,” said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the glory that awaited him"
3764,"Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants;"
3765,spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands
3766,"The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse, was Prince Bagratión"
3767,"Here it is!” was seen even on Prince Bagratión’s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes"
3768,"“Captain Túshin’s, your excellency!” shouted the red-haired, freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention"
3769,"In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagratión rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back"
3770,"Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagratión, could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their faces"
3771,"“Quite avare, your excellency,” suddenly shouted the colonel, touching his horse and turning purple in the face"
3772,"“They will help me!” In front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose"
3773,"Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying orders"
3774,"The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander’s face, and his lips were smiling"
3775,"The wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke, hung low over the field of battle on the horizon"
3776,"After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing:"
3777,"Irresistible drowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain"
3778,"his mother and her large white hand, Sónya’s thin little shoulders, Natásha’s eyes and laughter, Denísov with his voice and mustache, and Telyánin and all that affair with Telyánin and Bogdánich"
3779,The black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal
3780,"He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body"
3781,In the beginning of the winter of - Pierre received one of Anna Pávlovna’s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added:
3782,"And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vasíli, but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress"
3783,"“So we are to have visitors, mon prince?” remarked Mademoiselle Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers"
3784,"She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise"
3785,"they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well"
3786,I prefer you in your little gray everyday dress
3787,"Katie,” she said to the maid, “bring the princess her gray dress, and you’ll see, Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,” she added, smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure"
3788,"She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade"
3789,"The conversation was general and animated, thanks to Princess Lise’s voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth"
3790,"And this someone was he—the devil—and he was also this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips"
3791,"“What devil brought them here?” thought he, while Tíkhon was putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest"
3792,"Borís, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg’s move, and watched his opponent’s face, evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on"
3793,"now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses;"
3794,"Not only the generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth—felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and solemn affair"
3795,"The Tsar’s foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp"
3796,"Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible to Rostóv from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors"
3797,"When he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, “If it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment”), was listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier’s obsequious expression on his purple face, reporting something"
3798,"At that moment Borís clearly realized what he had before surmised, that in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced, purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskóy"
3799,"While Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that gentleman—evidently not sharing Borís’ conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination—looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that Borís felt uncomfortable"
3800,"All began to run and bustle, and Rostóv saw coming up the road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats"
3801,"When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, Kírsten filled others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the soldiers’ bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm"
3802,"“He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him ‘Your Majesty,’ but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me!"
3803,"His eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared—now the Emperor, now Denísov, and now Moscow memories—and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty darkness"
3804,"To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall"
3805,On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostóv could not at all make out:
3806,"was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses?"
3807,He even thought something moved on that white spot
3809,One was on a white horse
3810,"Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside"
3811,To keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it
3812,"And before Rostóv had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing"
3813,"Above him was a clear blue sky, and the sun’s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist"
3814,"Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals"
3815,"When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light—as if he had only awaited this to begin the action—he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin"
3816,An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat galloped up to Kutúzov and asked in the Emperor’s name had the fourth column advanced into action
3817,"One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one"
3818,"After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmütz where Bolkónski had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth"
3819,"The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner"
3820,"He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question—“Most likely he is asking at what o’clock they started,” thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brünn"
3821,"As this Ápsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Milorádovich, without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined in his horse before the Emperor"
3822,"This horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the Empress’ Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis’ black cob, nor of all that was being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider"
3823,"Nesvítski with an angry face, red and unlike himself, was shouting to Kutúzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner"
3824,"He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other"
3825,“Why doesn’t the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed?
3826,"And really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him, was about to be decided"
3827,"He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved"
3828,"Above him there was now nothing but the sky—the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly across it"
3829,"He could also, by the gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons"
3830,"He had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and across his path"
3831,"The heavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back its ears;"
3832,"Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostóv before he heard them shout, “Hurrah!” and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French"
3833,"“There he is!” said Borís, thinking Rostóv had said “His Highness,” and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse Guards’ jacket, shouting something to a pale, white uniformed Austrian officer"
3834,How they made the four black horses fly!
3835,One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rostóv;
3836,"Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the same"
3837,"On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts—on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses’ hoofs and between the wagon wheels, men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way"
3838,"Above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and between them gleamed blue infinity"
3839,"They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor Alexander’s Guards,” said the first one, indicating a Russian officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards"
3840,"The door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair, and merry faces"
3841,"“Or is it yours?” he said, addressing the black-mustached Denísov with servile deference"
3842,"She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long, slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered even by a ball dress"
3843,"and from there go on to the Rasgulyáy—the coachman Ipátka knows—and look up the gypsy Ilyúshka, the one who danced at Count Orlóv’s, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along to me"
3844,"The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside his plate, and proposed a toast, “To the health of the hero of our last campaign, Prince Peter Ivánovich Bagratión!” and again his blue eyes grew moist"
3845,"Dólokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his bright, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist’s face"
3846,"But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow"
3847,"The midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump white hands with an air of calm importance"
3848,"she sat silent, her luminous eyes fixed on her nurse’s wrinkled face (every line of which she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin"
3849,The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose locks of gray hair
3850,"The little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her head (the pains had just left her)"
3851,"Strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully"
3852,"She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen her in five minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks, the same expression was on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny black hair"
3853,In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed in Mary Bogdánovna’s trembling white hands
3854,"The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin, while the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy’s little red and wrinkled soles and palms"
3855,They were both dressed in white muslin with pink ribbons
3856,"He was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Natásha"
3857,She kissed his rough curly black head
3858,"The newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color"
3859,"The room was in black darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside something white"
3860,Pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book
3861,"The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth"
3862,This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and part of his legs;
3863,"he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from below"
3864,Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with blood
3865,Round a long table covered with black sat some twelve men in garments like those he had already seen
3866,"When he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather apron, such as the others wore, was put on him:"
3867,"The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:"
3868,"Everywhere he saw the stewards’ accounts, according to which the serfs’ manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats"
3869,"Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters"
3870,"A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her back, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up"
3871,Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face when they went in
3872,"When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Deméntyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavrúshka gleefully shouted to his master, “The count has come!” and Denísov, who had been asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rostóv experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak"
3873,A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him
3874,"Well, I’ve had a bit of fun I can tell you!” cried Denísov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing under his black mustache"
3875,"Those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at Rostóv with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and envy of another’s health"
3876,"Close to the corner, on an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostóv"
3877,"His eyes, looking serenely and steadily at Rostóv, seemed to be veiled by something, as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality"
3878,"A short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason, attracted Rostóv’s attention"
3879,"He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over a white vest, and the St"
3880,He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth
3881,"Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand, tore it in doing so, and threw it away"
3882,"The members of his suite, guessing at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another, and a page—the same one Rostóv had seen the previous evening at Borís’—ran forward and, bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon"
3883,"Then he approached Lázarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white hand holding the Order touched one of Lázarev’s buttons"
3884,"Lázarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexander’s eyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do something else"
3885,"Next he thought of that self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander"
3886,"Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the calèche looking at the new grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky"
3887,"They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge, uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road"
3888,"The birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year’s leaves"
3889,"“Yes, really everything is green already"
3890,"Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped"
3891,"Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other"
3892,"Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its full, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky"
3893,"In the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood around, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots"
3894,"Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles, scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red nose"
3895,The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast
3896,"this man, not long since an insignificant divinity student, who now, Bolkónski thought, held in his hands—those plump white hands—the fate of Russia"
3897,"The smile vanished from Speránski’s white face, which was much improved by the change"
3898,"This was Speránski’s cold, mirrorlike look, which did not allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power"
3899,"One night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket, without her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing under her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and bowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and Natásha, also in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in curlpapers, ran in"
3900,"Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch"
3901,"Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats"
3902,"The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed à la grecque"
3903,the openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on;
3904,"Turning her mother’s head this way and that, she fastened on the cap and, hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her skirt"
3905,"He was wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was perfumed and his hair pomaded"
3906,"She had washed behind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing room in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old lady’s maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostóvs’ servants had been"
3907,"She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her fur cloak, and, beside Sónya and in front of her mother, mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers"
3908,"The mirrors on the landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms"
3909,"The two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess’ eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim Natásha"
3910,"That gray-haired man,” she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said"
3911,"But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon"
3912,Natásha at once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform:
3913,"She did not listen to or look at Véra, who was telling her something about her own green dress"
3914,"Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the front row of the circle not far from the Rostóvs"
3915,"Her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness"
3916,When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the dancers
3917,"Speránski, wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance"
3918,"Still laughing, Speránski held out his soft white hand to Prince Andrew"
3919,He patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her
3920,"a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief"
3921,"but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavrúshka (Denísov’s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going home"
3922,"Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mítenka out by the scruff of the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility at convenient moments between the words, shouting, “Be off!"
3923,"The verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the spring buckwheat"
3924,"The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye"
3925,"The earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist"
3926,"Mílka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched her hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache"
3927,"“What orders, your excellency?” said the huntsman in his deep bass, deep as a proto-deacon’s and hoarse with hallooing—and two flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent"
3928,"In front rode a fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache"
3929,Natásha sat easily and confidently on her black Arábchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand
3930,"The old count, knowing his son’s ardor in the hunt, hurried so as not to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count Ilyá Rostóv, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him, where a wolf might come out"
3931,"This person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman’s cloak, with a tall peaked cap on his head"
3932,"On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless, his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face"
3933,She was an old animal with a gray back and big reddish belly
3934,"Old Karáy had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas, baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs"
3935,"The first to come into view was Mílka, with her black markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf"
3936,"That instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears laid back (Karáy was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest moment of his life"
3937,"He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite"
3938,"The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard across the field"
3939,"Now they drew close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion;"
3940,"one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat"
3941,And it was my gray bitch that caught it!
3942,"Rostóv was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred, red-spotted bitch on Ilágin’s leash, slender but with muscles like steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes"
3943,"In the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilágin about the year’s harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch"
3944,"Yes, she’s a good dog, gets what she’s after,” answered Ilágin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erzá, for which, a year before, he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs"
3945,“That black-spotted one of yours is fine—well shaped!” said he
3946,"Shall we both course it?” answered Nicholas, seeing in Erzá and “Uncle’s” red Rugáy two rivals he had never yet had a chance of pitting against his own borzois"
3947,"“Rugáyushka!” he added, involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this red borzoi"
3948,"The two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue him, but they had not gone far before Ilágin’s red-spotted Erzá passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, rolled over like a ball"
3949,"From behind Erzá rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted Mílka and began rapidly gaining on the hare"
3950,"That’s it, come on!” came a third voice just then, and “Uncle’s” red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously, sinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare"
3951,"For a long time they continued to look at red Rugáy who, his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked along just behind “Uncle’s” horse with the serene air of a conqueror"
3952,"“Uncle” led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suvórov, of the host’s father and mother, and of himself in military uniform"
3953,"After a while “Uncle” came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and small top boots"
3954,"Soon after “Uncle’s” reappearance the door was opened, evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking woman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered carrying a large loaded tray"
3955,"She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors d’oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table"
3956,"Something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches, especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here and there, as he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to snap"
3957,In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke
3958,"“Well, you see, first I thought that Rugáy, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then for his manner"
3959,"“He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked at us"
3960,"“Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the porch?”"
3961,"Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the old count’s with a trotter from the Orlóv stud as shaft horse, the fourth was Nicholas’ own with a short shaggy black shaft horse"
3962,"Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at him from her sable furs—so close and yet so distant—in the moonlight"
3963,"“Isn’t it time to begin now?” In front, already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off, the black horses driven by Zakhár could be clearly seen against the white snow"
3964,"“Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!” said one of the strange, pretty, unfamiliar people—the one with fine eyebrows and mustache"
3965,"“But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals"
3966,"The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was gay"
3967,Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the snow and on the path
3968,something blue and red
3969,"At first she heard only Métivier’s voice, then her father’s, then both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open, and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified Métivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards"
3970,"But in Julie’s presence, looking at her red face and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss, Borís could not utter the decisive words, though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of those Pénza and Nizhegórod estates and had apportioned the use of the income from them"
3971,"The door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white nightcap, came in"
3972,She came in to dinner with red eyes
3973,"Her black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music, crumpling her program"
3974,Natásha looked in the direction in which her father’s eyes were turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck—which Natásha knew was covered with powder
3975,Behind them sat Anna Mikháylovna wearing a green headdress and with a happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face
3976,"A tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling into her place"
3977,In the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts
3978,"One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was glued"
3979,"When they had finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter’s box and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger, went up to her and began singing, waving his arms about"
3980,"In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands"
3981,Then some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue
3982,"The maiden who had been first in white and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the throne with her hair down"
3983,"Natásha had not time to take off the bodice before the door opened and Countess Bezúkhova, dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with good-humored amiable smiles"
3984,"Mademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and assumed an unnatural pose"
3985,"Natásha looked round at her, and then, red and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved toward the door"
3986,"red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, glittering little eyes, and a small beard"
3987,"On entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front corner of the room, and went up to Dólokhov, holding out a small, black hand"
3988,"After refusing it for manners’ sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap"
3989,"A handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable mantle on her arm"
3990,"Márya Dmítrievna put a pillow under her head, covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower water, but Natásha did not respond to her"
3991,"In a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makárin dashed past"
3992,"His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat, tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with powdery snow"
3993,And clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room
3994,"Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky"
3995,"Almost in the center of it, above the Prechístenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant comet of —the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world"
3996,"On the contrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly—like an arrow piercing the earth—to remain fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars"
3997,On the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill
3998,"When the aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment, ventured to draw the Emperor’s attention to the devotion of the Poles to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention"
3999,"Arakchéev looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him"
4000,"A French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied by two hussars"
4001,"In front of the group, on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders"
4002,"He wore a red mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion"
4003,"I wish success to your mission,” and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him"
4004,"Four days before, sentinels of the Preobrazhénsk regiment had stood in front of the house to which Balashëv was conducted, and now two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan"
4005,"He had just finished dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots"
4006,"His plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau de Cologne"
4007,"But in order to begin negotiations, what is demanded of me?” he said, frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand"
4008,"And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood, and that Balashëv still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned round, drew close to Balashëv’s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:"
4009,"Tattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding before the wind"
4010,"They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something confused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could be seen"
4011,"Rostóv, with his keen sportsman’s eye, was one of the first to catch sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans"
4012,"Rostóv, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after him"
4013,"That Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber"
4014,"Before Rostóv had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, “I surrender!” He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rostóv’s face"
4015,"And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes?"
4016,"But the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life that lay before her"
4017,"Even at ten o’clock, when the Rostóvs got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor, that content and discontent with the present, which is most strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town"
4018,"With a sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd, Natásha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked—as women can walk—with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul"
4019,"The priest came out with his purple velvet biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort"
4020,Pétya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and resembled Natásha
4021,"” But in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it;"
4022,"When he came to himself, a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock—probably a church clerk and chanter—was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other"
4023,"Poor dear, he’s as white as a sheet!”—various voices were heard saying"
4024,"In the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals"
4025,"The crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed, almost all of whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing boston at the clubs"
4026,"Frowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs"
4027,"Only now in the stillness of the night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he grasp its meaning for a moment"
4028,"Having received all his orders Alpátych, wearing a white beaver hat—a present from the prince—and carrying a stick as the prince did, went out accompanied by his family"
4029,"Women’s fuss!” muttered Alpátych to himself and started on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time"
4030,"He was a stout, dark, red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly"
4031,"“What are you staring at?” he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt, with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said"
4032,On two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires
4033,"The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads"
4034,"Prince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking at Alpátych from the back of the crowd"
4035,The fire died down for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof
4036,"An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast shoe"
4037,"On seeing the young master, the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped"
4038,Evidently these girls passionately desired one thing—to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught—and Prince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise
4039,"The sun, a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat"
4040,"The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing about in it"
4041,"All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking, floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic"
4042,"The officer, Timókhin, with his red little nose, standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless"
4043,"She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue, could not be sure what change there was in his face"
4044,"It was a warm, gray morning"
4045,"He was lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt;"
4046,“Put on your white dress
4047,"She ran out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had planted"
4048,"Dron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty"
4049,It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black dress and weepers
4050,"Toward midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house"
4051,"She vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills, muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her"
4052,"What is he thinking now?” This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief"
4053,"At that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers"
4054,"“The one in pink is mine, so keep off!” said Ilyín on seeing Dunyásha running resolutely toward him"
4055,"Ah, friend—my pink one is delicious;"
4056,"Kutúzov was impatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard’s cap with a red band and no peak, nodding his head continually"
4057,He was wearing the white Horse Guard’s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap
4058,"Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief"
4059,"At the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for compensation"
4060,"“Well, that’s all!” said Kutúzov as he signed the last of the documents, and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression"
4061,"The flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and a green jacket, who was moaning piteously"
4062,"Almost all of them stared with naïve, childlike curiosity at Pierre’s white hat and green swallow-tail coat"
4063,"Another, a young lad, a fair-haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile"
4064,"He kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat"
4065,"When he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road"
4066,"From above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the Smolénsk highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it"
4067,"Here and there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops—ours and the enemy’s"
4068,"” Pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible"
4069,"There’s our center, at Borodinó, just there,” and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white church"
4070,"With a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body, with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had lost, Kutúzov walked with plunging, swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest"
4071,"He crossed himself with an accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and bowed his white head with a deep sigh"
4072,His white head twitched with the effort
4073,“The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die
4074,"In the middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket"
4075,"And from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without shadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline"
4076,"There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured, and tormented me,” said he to himself, passing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception of death"
4077,"And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me"
4078,"He looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark"
4079,"The red-nosed Captain Timókhin, formerly Dólokhov’s squadron commander, but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster"
4080,"Two valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room"
4081,"Napoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped in front of him"
4082,"A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the staff could be heard conversing in French, and Kutúzov’s gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his shoulders"
4083,"A white church could be seen through the mist, and here and there the roofs of huts in Borodinó as well as dense masses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance"
4084,"“Puff!”—suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white, and “boom!” came the report a second later"
4085,"They all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat, who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse’s hoofs"
4086,The intrusion of Pierre’s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first
4087,"But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard, their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the regiment"
4088,"“And how’s it you’re not afraid, sir, really now?” a red-faced, broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set of sound, white teeth"
4089,"“Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman’s hat off!” cried the red-faced humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre"
4090,a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something
4091,The officer’s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow
4092,“Where am I going?” he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition wagons
4093,"the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed, only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and piercing cries"
4094,"But he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that the soldier shouting “Brothers!” was a prisoner, and that another man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something"
4095,"The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him away"
4096,"“Reinforcements?” said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at the adjutant—a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Murat’s own—as though he did not understand his words"
4097,"On the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat Kutúzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed"
4098,"Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted aside"
4099,"“Can this be death?” thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new, envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke that curled up from the rotating black ball"
4100,"He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life"
4101,"Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head"
4102,"Four soldiers were holding him, and a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back"
4103,"“Ooh, ooh, ooh!” grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth, he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing, and prolonged yells"
4104,"Raévski, twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit, glanced now at Kutúzov and now at the door with a look of impatience"
4105,"A few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which Hélène gave at her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert, a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes, a Jesuit à robe courte * was presented to her, and in the garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the consolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and the next"
4106,"All that was done around her and to her at this time, all the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant, refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure, but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim"
4107,"Hélène was wearing a white dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom"
4108,"The abbé, a well-fed man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to Hélène and, with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty, occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject"
4109,The groom recognized Pierre in the darkness by his white hat
4110,"“And who is that?” he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face"
4111,"the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed Pétya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show—when he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it—then his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other children"
4112,"A tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom"
4113,In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily
4114,"Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads"
4115,"A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm, persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms"
4116,"From one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was flung out violently"
4117,While still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him
4118,"One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others"
4119,"Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty fingers"
4120,"The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare"
4121,"This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots"
4122,"A vein in the young man’s long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed"
4123,The count’s face was white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw
4124,"Only at the end of it, in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating"
4125,"His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted"
4126,Delicious!” His face grew red and was covered with perspiration
4127,"Timókhin, kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap"
4128,"Timókhin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew’s regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodinó"
4129,"While listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face"
4130,"It was something white by the door—the statue of a sphinx, which also oppressed him"
4131,"In that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall, something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door;"
4132,"but besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door"
4133,"But as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the Súkharev market with the pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat"
4134,"In another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man’s musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street"
4135,"On the ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long, prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap"
4136,The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke
4137,"The sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration"
4138,"And a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden"
4139,"When they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat"
4140,"That very young woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched, black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long, beautiful, expressionless face"
4141,"Pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether anyone knew where she had gone"
4142,"One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope"
4143,"He wore a woman’s loose gown of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian boots"
4144,"The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and, saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots"
4145,"The Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes"
4146,"All the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials"
4147,"The governor’s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most important personages of the town"
4148,“Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it
4149,"a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his wife’s carriage, little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to her, and so on—and these pictures of the future had given him pleasure"
4150,"” said Sónya, with a white face and trembling lips"
4151,"I saw him lying on a bed,” said she, making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, “and that he had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were folded,” she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror"
4152,She not only remembered what she had then said—that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with something red—but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed
4153,"“Yes, yes, it really was pink!” cried Natásha, who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction"
4154,So with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed—interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes—she wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas
4155,On the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms
4156,"very bad,” sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face"
4157,"The Krémlin, which was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of Iván the Great"
4158,"He and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin’s Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent"
4159,To the right and left of the post stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos
4160,"The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes"
4161,"His head was quite round, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever ready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his large, gentle brown eyes were also round"
4162,"But his brilliantly white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed—as he often did—were all sound and good, there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance"
4163,"servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way"
4164,"In one thin, translucently white hand he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly"
4165,In the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepák with much spirit and agility
4166,"When Eýkhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared, Kutúzov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame for the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on"
4167,"It was an autumn night with dark purple clouds, but no rain"
4168,"He rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering suggestions that they should attack"
4169,"Its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well"
4170,But when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm
4171,You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm
4172,"He visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with Tutólmin"
4173,"Early in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about him"
4174,"Its lack of a master, a name, or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the least"
4175,"The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance, with the village, the church, and the large white house"
4176,"The bare trees, the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire, and the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness"
4177,"Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence"
4178,"Karatáev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work, was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot"
4179,"His hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast, and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever"
4180,"When on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance, when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when afterwards light gleamed from the east and the sun’s rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the river, all began to sparkle in the glad light—Pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had never before known"
4181,"they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the corporal’s face when the drums were beating"
4182,"A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze"
4183,"The huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the red campfires were growing paler and dying down"
4184,"When the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up, first blue and then red, Shcherbínin lit the tallow candle, from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away, and looked at the messenger"
4185,"His thin face with its short, thick black beard looked angry"
4186,"A little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap"
4187,"A little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghíz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue French overcoat"
4188,"Beside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse"
4189,"The boy held on to the hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise"
4190,"The horses, being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay"
4191,"While they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices shouting together came up from the slope"
4192,"Down below, a man wearing something red was running through the marsh"
4193,"The man whom they called Tíkhon, having run to the stream, plunged in so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on"
4194,"On the table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt"
4195,The black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge
4196,"Noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dólokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were"
4197,"Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod"
4198,Near the watchman’s hut the black shapes of the Cossacks’ shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen
4199,He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared
4200,"Pétya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denísov’s guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under it Likhachëv was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark blotch to the right was the watchman’s hut, and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink;"
4201,"Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an enormous monster"
4202,"Sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing, and a clear black sky appeared"
4203,Sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds
4204,"A gallant-looking Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face, had been defending himself against the hussars"
4205,"After speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they surrendered, Dólokhov dismounted and went up to Pétya, who lay motionless with outstretched arms"
4206,"All who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had rejoined Karatáev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen Karatáev for its master"
4207,"The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion"
4208,"The Duke!” and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by"
4209,"Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face"
4210,"The general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse"
4211,"His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy, hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod"
4212,His brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal
4213,"Looking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog, sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail"
4214,"One day toward the end of December Natásha, pale and thin, dressed in a black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door"
4215,"Kutúzov rode to Dóbroe on his plump little white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back"
4216,"At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutúzov who, wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his white horse"
4217,Through the falling snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener
4218,"By the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden down"
4219,"Fetch some more wood!” shouted a red-haired and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire"
4220,"This red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself"
4221,"“Look out, your soles will fly off!” shouted the red-haired man, noticing that the sole of the dancer’s boot was hanging loose"
4222,"“Right enough, friend,” said he, and, having sat down, took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his foot"
4223,"“he was white—as white as birchbark—and some of them are such fine fellows, you might think they were nobles"
4224,"“But it’s strange, friends,” continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness, “the peasants at Mozháysk were saying that when they began burying the dead—where the battle was you know—well, those dead had been lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, ‘they lie as white as paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke"
4225,"But theirs,’ he says, ‘are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder"
4226,"Ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes"
4227,"He remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical distress, and pains in his feet and side"
4228,"“This must be one of her companions,” he thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress"
4229,"He glanced once at the companion’s face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and, as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary"
4230,She again glanced rapidly from Pierre’s face to that of the lady in the black dress and said:
4231,"Pierre looked again at the companion’s pale, delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes"
4232,"She was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before, yet she was quite different"
4233,"Countess Mary turned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply"
4234,"Five minutes later little black-eyed three-year-old Natásha, her father’s pet, having learned from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran to her father unobserved by her mother"
4235,"She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby’s napkin, and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better"
4236,"Mílka, the old gray borzoi bitch (daughter of the first Mílka), with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside him;"
4237,"“A diary, Nicholas,” she replied, handing him a blue exercise book filled with her firm, bold writing"
4238,The army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la Vièrge
4239,The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose
4240,and then there are all the beautiful white feathers
4241,"the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches"
4242,"At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower, and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl;"
4243,"but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower;"
4244,"how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, ‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go back to the house;"
4245,"The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam"
4246,"So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:"
4247,"Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a broomstick in her hand:"
4248,and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and green
4249,"and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm;"
4250,"and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:"
4251,"In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising"
4252,"And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the lightnings played, and the thunders rolled;"
4253,"and you might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon their heads"
4254,"‘I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers"
4255,"he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the christening"
4256,I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself
4257,"I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse"
4258,"The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body;"
4259,"‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was dead"
4260,"so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and harnessed six mice to it;"
4261,"One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable"
4262,"The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies"
4263,"’ ‘Ah, father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me"
4264,"’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road"
4265,"Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven"
4266,"Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near"
4267,"’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white duck is swimming there:"
4268,"Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else;"
4269,"They gave her wine to drink, three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow, and with that her heart gave way and she died"
4270,"There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, was quite happy and thought:"
4271,I saw the black rascal with my own eyes
4272,"’ So they went to the water together, and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon the peasants cried:"
4273,"so he said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are!"
4274,"if you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you"
4275,"’ ‘Go into the garden and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons:"
4276,"and when they found what these yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of plates and dishes"
4277,"and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow buttons:"
4278,those yellow buttons were all my money:
4279,"’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and wait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will change myself into a red stone landmark"
4280,"’ Then Roland went away, and the girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved"
4281,"‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped"
4282,"Swiftly he sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it"
4283,"The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it"
4284,"Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow up;"
4285,"her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and her hair as black as ebony;"
4286,"on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in them;"
4287,"for she was even now as white as snow, and as red as blood, and as black as ebony"
4288,"But God sent two angels from heaven in the shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her food until the seven years were over"
4289,"You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck, and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your throat"
4290,"On this the huntsman asked the king if he would like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form of the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron, and his knife by his side"
4291,"’ She lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave"
4292,And the snow fell and spread a beautiful white covering over the grave;
4293,"and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat:"
4294,"Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window;"
4295,Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window;
4296,"Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the shoe, that her white stockings were quite red"
4297,"And when they came to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang:"
4298,"When he had carefully locked the door, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish"
4299,"The wretch often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet"
4300,"’ But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried:"
4301,"‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you:"
4302,‘Strew some white meal over my feet for me
4303,"’ Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him"
4304,"When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep"
4305,"‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted"
4306,"So the months followed one another, and first the trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall"
4307,"’ Then she felt comforted and happy again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy was so great that she died"
4308,"the child of his first wife was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow"
4309,"So she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer;"
4310,"he asked, ‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing"
4311,"Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her, and she wept no more"
4312,"’ Then he called his daughter and the children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two bright stars in its head"
4313,on the upper shelf you will see a pair of red shoes;
4314,"The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he went back to the roof and sang:"
4315,The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:
4316,"that is indeed a splendid bird, and he has given me a pair of red shoes"
4317,"so, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well, and sowed turnips"
4318,"so I laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground"
4319,"and in a few days they crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where the tailor had sewn them together"
4320,"In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came in and looked for him, she found only a white dove;"
4321,"and it said to her, ‘Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you the way I am going;"
4322,"and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey"
4323,"yet repose was still far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove"
4324,"’ So she went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill’s top and the valley’s depth—hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the sun, ‘I have not seen it;"
4325,"and when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest through the night, over field and grove—hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give thee an egg—break it when need comes"
4326,"and she raised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf—hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the night-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds;"
4327,"’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the white dove—he has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;"
4328,"He found the blue light, and made her a signal to draw him up again"
4329,"She did draw him up, but when he came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the blue light away from him"
4330,"The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue light went on burning, but of what use was that to him?"
4331,"‘This shall be my last pleasure,’ thought he, pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke"
4332,"When the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said:"
4333,"’ The little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him"
4334,"’ ‘Nothing more is needed than that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear before you at once"
4335,"When it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said:"
4336,"’ The black manikin heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him"
4337,"In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket"
4338,"As soon as the soldier was alone again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin"
4339,"‘Go wheresoever they take you, and let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you"
4340,"’ Then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand, and said:"
4341,"the first day it will be drawn by four white, the second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses;"
4342,"At two o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;"
4343,"One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf"
4344,"at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word"
4345,"The little black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it"
4346,"’ So he once more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers"
4347,Now the white snake was an enchanted princess;
4348,"Scarcely had he spoken these words when he heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and round"
4349,"‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed mouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat"
4350,"‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a little pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has"
4351,"It so happened that his road one day led through a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow, and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young lady by her side looking about them"
4352,"and when the boy was at the top of the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding hole"
4353,"’ And when he had said that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery eyes"
4354,"But when he had made away with these two, and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put it out"
4355,"He was old, however, and had a long white beard"
4356,"The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down"
4357,"so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker’s oven"
4358,‘Whose are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she
4359,"When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees"
4360,"‘You shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse"
4361,"On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him a white horse"
4362,"On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and a black horse, and again he caught the apple"
4363,"When the king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing:"
4364,"In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses"
4365,"They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully"
4366,"Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed"
4367,"And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings"
4368,"it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door"
4369,and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived
4370,He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried:
4371,"but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard;"
4372,"You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you clumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole"
4373,"He was still cursing when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest"
4374,"She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red"
4375,"QUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace __ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof"
4376,"I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow—a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white"
4377,"I followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting, far gone in rum, with his arms on the table"
4378,"The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head"
4379,"all the brown had gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue;"
4380,they’d have the black spot on me by then
4381,"Now, if I can’t get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it’s my old sea-chest they’re after;"
4382,"But you won’t peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim—him above all"
4383,"“But what is the black spot, captain?” I asked"
4384,"He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose;"
4385,"It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I shall never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and windows;"
4386,I could not doubt that this was the black spot;
4387,"This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger’s stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens"
4388,"Long before it was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire’s name) had got up from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll"
4389,“This is the black-hearted hound’s account-book
4390,"” There were several additions of a later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink—two on the north part of the island, one in the southwest—and beside this last, in the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the captain’s tottery characters, these words:"
4391,"you can find it by the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it"
4392,"While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor’s walk"
4393,the windows had neat red curtains;
4394,"At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint"
4395,"But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness"
4396,"Here’s this poor old innocent bird o’ mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may lay to that"
4397,"so it was with the old Walrus, Flint’s old ship, as I’ve seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold"
4398,"Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking up, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail;"
4399,"This was not the map we found in Billy Bones’s chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things—names and heights and soundings—with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes"
4400,"This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others—some singly, some in clumps;"
4401,The slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed
4402,"Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation"
4403,"“Silver,” said the other man—and I observed he was not only red in the face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a taut rope—“Silver,” says he, “you’re old, and you’re honest, or has the name for it;"
4404,“It’s a black conscience that can make you feared of me
4405,I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing
4406,"One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf"
4407,"The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater"
4408,I keep her under the white rock
4409,"The squire was sitting down, as white as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!"
4410,"And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he’s to come alone"
4411,"but, sure enough, there was the Jolly Roger—the black flag of piracy—flying from her peak"
4412,"Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the air"
4413,"and now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in colour"
4414,It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one
4415,only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand
4416,"URE enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself, standing placidly by"
4417,"But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass"
4418,"an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head"
4419,"The doctor’s watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy loading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be certain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is"
4420,I pitched it in red-hot on purpose;
4421,"One man, in a red night-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across"
4422,"Well, so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade"
4423,"I was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat, a thing quite worth doing, as I still believe"
4424,"Soon cool draughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth into the open borders of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach"
4425,"Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets—him I could always recognize—while a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks, one of them with a red cap—the very rogue that I had seen some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade"
4426,"Soon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion"
4427,"The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub"
4428,"Right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully;"
4429,"The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap"
4430,"North of Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand"
4431,"To the north of that, again, there comes another cape—Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart—buried in tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea"
4432,"Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;"
4433,"I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail"
4434,"The Hispaniola was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver"
4435,I could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot
4436,"red-cap on his back, as stiff as a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips;"
4437,"At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but—what was ghastly to behold—neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage"
4438,"The bulkheads, all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands"
4439,"In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber"
4440,"As for that swab, he’s good and dead, he is,” he added, indicating the man with the red cap"
4441,"And again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down their cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard"
4442,Will you have white or red?”
4443,"Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury"
4444,"We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still spread out, tumbling stiffly after us"
4445,"it was the horror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that still green water, beside the body of the coxswain"
4446,the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface;
4447,"It was red and hot, and now and again it was a little darkened—as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering"
4448,"the rest, and the block house itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light"
4449,"On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation, contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon"
4451,"HE red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house, showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized"
4452,"They had set me with my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the face, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black despair in my heart"
4453,"One after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces;"
4454,"And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house"
4455,“The black spot!
4456,But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in
4457,"“This crew has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound;"
4458,"in the meantime, your black spot ain’t worth a biscuit"
4459,Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance?
4460,"And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly recognized—none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain’s chest"
4461,"And now, shipmates, this black spot?"
4462,"The explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver’s black looks had restrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the house"
4463,"The red cross was, of course, far too large to be a guide;"
4464,Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines;
4465,"At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human skeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground"
4466,"Sheer above us rose the Spyglass, here dotted with single pines, there black with precipices"
4467,“that blue in the face too!”
4468,"Coming through the clear, sunny atmosphere among the green tree-tops, I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly;"
4469,When did ever a gentleman o’ fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug—and him dead too?”
4470,"The third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood—a giant of a vegetable, with a red column as big as a cottage, and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred"
4471,"This also added to my wretchedness, and to crown all, I was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau, when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face—he who died at Savannah, singing and shouting for drink—had there, with his own hand, cut down his six accomplices"
4472,"As we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth of Ben Gunn’s cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a musket"

4613,"Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick"
4614,"When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by"
4615,So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was paved with yellow brick
4616,"The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good"
4617,"After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again"
4618,"On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits"
4619,"They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick"
4620,"They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City"
4621,"There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes"
4622,"But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about;"
4623,"“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,” he said;"
4624,"The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them"
4625,"“We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the Scarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away"
4626,"It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire"
4627,"As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature"
4628,"Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers"
4629,"“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City"
4630,and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt
4631,"“Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color"
4632,"The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal"
4633,"The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them"
4634,"As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels"
4635,It was high and thick and of a bright green color
4636,"In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy"
4637,At his side was a large green box
4638,"“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well"
4639,All of them had green glasses in them
4640,"Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto;"
4641,"Even with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City"
4642,The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds
4643,"They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun"
4644,The window panes were of green glass;
4645,"even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green"
4646,"There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins"
4647,"Green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts"
4648,"At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies"
4649,"the men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them"
4650,"There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard"
4651,So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds
4652,"The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when they were seated he said politely:"
4653,"The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room"
4654,"She had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said, “Follow me and I will show you your room"
4655,"So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace"
4656,"It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane"
4657,"There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin"
4658,"Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books"
4659,"When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny"
4660,"In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet;"
4661,"“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and if you wish for anything ring the bell"
4662,"The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin"
4663,"Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto’s neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz"
4664,"Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is the signal"
4665,But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room
4666,The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and said:
4667,She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels
4668,On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman and said:
4669,"It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold its weight"
4670,The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz
4671,“Be careful!” cried the green girl
4672,“The tears will fall on your green silk gown and spot it
4673,"Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly oiled"
4674,"The green girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy’s basket with good things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto’s neck with a green ribbon"
4675,"They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg"
4676,The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived
4677,The ribbon around Toto’s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy’s dress
4678,"Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black bees came flying toward her"
4679,"And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal"
4680,The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth
4681,"But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them"
4682,"“I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes"
4683,"There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated them with great cruelty"
4684,"So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage"
4685,"So they set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever"
4686,It was much harder to find their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried
4687,So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman
4688,"In a few minutes they heard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her"
4689,"He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could do"
4690,"The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them"
4691,"So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not"
4692,"Promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier came to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the Great Oz"
4693,"Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald City;"
4694,"and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green"
4695,“But isn’t everything here green?” asked Dorothy
4696,"“but when you wear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you"
4697,"But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy"
4698,"He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully carved"
4699,"First there was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald green;"
4700,"It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long"
4701,"So he sent the soldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon"
4702,"“Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said, “and ask his advice"
4703,"The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate"
4704,"But he at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them"
4705,"All they could see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz"
4706,The first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers that stretched about the Emerald City on every side
4707,"Then, to their surprise, they found before them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china"
4708,Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter
4709,"and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes;"
4710,"and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps"
4711,"No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again"
4712,"Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy could see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainly that he had been mended in many places"
4713,See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees
4714,"Its legs were quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair"
4715,"The fences and houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had been painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins"
4716,"The Quadlings themselves, who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain"
4717,"Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid;"
4718,Her hair was a rich red in color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders
4719,"Her dress was pure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl"
4720,"Yet with all this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window, knitting “cotton warp” quilts—she had knitted sixteen of them, as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices—and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond"
4721,and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables
4722,"moreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea;"
4723,"Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy, was something that didn’t happen often"
4724,"Very green and neat and precise was that yard, set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies"
4725,"but the east one, whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left orchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook, was greened over by a tangle of vines"
4726,Yet what of Matthew’s white collar and the sorrel mare?
4727,her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it
4728,"He may have been quite right in thinking so, for he was an odd-looking personage, with an ungainly figure and long iron-gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders, and a full, soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty"
4729,"She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair"
4730,"Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled;"
4731,"her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others"
4732,"Matthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag;"
4733,"I wouldn’t be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don’t you think?"
4734,"Not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees and slim white birches, were several feet above their heads"
4735,"What did that tree, leaning out from the bank, all white and lacy, make you think of?” she asked"
4736,"“Why, a bride, of course—a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil"
4737,But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress
4738,"But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress—because when you are imagining you might as well imagine something worth while—and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and boots"
4739,But those red roads are so funny
4740,When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn’t know and for pity’s sake not to ask her any more questions
4741,And what does make the roads red?”
4742,Nobody could who has red hair
4743,I don’t mind the other things so much—the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness
4744,I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes
4745,But I cannot imagine that red hair away
4746,"I think to myself, ‘Now my hair is a glorious black, black as the raven’s wing"
4747,’ But all the time I know it is just plain red and it breaks my heart
4748,I read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn’t red hair
4749,Below the boughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse of painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle
4750,"She leaned back in the buggy, her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to the white splendor above"
4751,"“Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,” she whispered, “that place we came through—that white place—what was it?”"
4752,"A bridge spanned it midway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of sand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a glory of many shifting hues—the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever been found"
4753,Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection
4754,"There was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was shining from one of its windows"
4755,It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds
4756,"At last they lingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white with blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods"
4757,"Do you know, my arm must be black and blue from the elbow up, for I’ve pinched myself so many times today"
4758,"But when her eyes fell on the odd little figure in the stiff, ugly dress, with the long braids of red hair and the eager, luminous eyes, she stopped short in amazement"
4759,"In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner table adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin"
4760,"Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white muslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand"
4761,"She deliberately picked up Anne’s clothes, placed them neatly on a prim yellow chair, and then, taking up the candle, went over to the bed"
4762,Anne’s white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a startling suddenness
4763,"IT was broad daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky"
4764,"In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind"
4765,"Below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew, upspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful possibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally"
4766,"Beyond it was a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir;"
4767,there was a gap in it where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible
4768,"Off to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over green, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea"
4769,And isn’t pink the most bewitching color in the world?
4770,"Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young, but got to be another color when she grew up?”"
4771,They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke
4772,"On the left were the steep red sandstone cliffs, so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than the sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her"
4773,Don’t you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day;
4774,"Mrs. Spencer lived in a big yellow house at White Sands Cove, and she came to the door with surprise and welcome mingled on her benevolent face"
4775,"“You’d find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,” said Anne reproachfully"
4776,“People who haven’t red hair don’t know what trouble is
4777,"Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red on purpose, and I’ve never cared about Him since"
4778,"I’d go out into a great big field all alone or into the deep, deep, woods, and I’d look up into the sky—up—up—up—into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness"
4779,"and it suddenly occurred to her that that simple little prayer, sacred to white-robed childhood lisping at motherly knees, was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch of a girl who knew and cared nothing about God’s love, since she had never had it translated to her through the medium of human love"
4780,The white and green light strained through apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt little figure with a half-unearthly radiance
4781,"“That,” she said, pointing to the picture—a rather vivid chromo entitled, “Christ Blessing Little Children”—“and I was just imagining I was one of them—that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing off by herself in the corner as if she didn’t belong to anybody, like me"
4782,"Anne tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft kiss on a pink-cupped bud, and then studied diligently for some moments longer"
4783,"It’s bad enough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn’t endure it in a bosom friend"
4784,She has black eyes and hair and rosy cheeks
4785,"But just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley, and the loveliest echo lived there"
4786,The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the windows
4787,"This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions, pink and blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it"
4788,"I am tall and regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair"
4789,Her pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her
4790,"And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill"
4791,it was set about with smooth red sandstones and rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern;
4792,And hair as red as carrots!
4793,I’m sure I don’t know why you should lose your temper like that just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely
4794,Anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into the garden
4795,My hair is red and I’m freckled and skinny and ugly
4796,"but I knew a girl once—went to school with her, in fact—whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she was young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn"
4797,And you can pick a bouquet of them white June lilies over in the corner if you like
4798,When Marilla went home Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands
4799,one was of black-and-white checkered sateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter;
4800,and one was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that week at a Carmody store
4801,The brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school when you begin to go
4802,"“I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves,” she whispered disconsolately"
4803,"Anne started off irreproachable, arrayed in the stiff black-and-white sateen, which, while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of skimpiness, contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure"
4804,"Whatever other people might have thought of the result it satisfied Anne, and she tripped gaily down the road, holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very proudly"
4805,"There was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them, ‘way, ‘way down, deep into the water"
4806,"I know pink and yellow aren’t becoming to me,” began Anne"
4807,"She was a tall black-eyed, black-haired woman, with a very resolute mouth"
4808,"She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother’s black eyes and hair, and rosy cheeks, and the merry expression which was her inheritance from her father"
4809,"Prim, right-angled paths neatly bordered with clamshells, intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds between old-fashioned flowers ran riot"
4810,pink and blue and white columbines and lilac-tinted Bouncing Bets;
4811,"purple Adam-and-Eve, daffodils, and masses of sweet clover white with its delicate, fragrant, feathery sprays;"
4812,scarlet lightning that shot its fiery lances over prim white musk-flowers;
4813,"it’s a perfectly beautiful picture, she says—a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress"
4814,"IT’S time Anne was in to do her sewing,” said Marilla, glancing at the clock and then out into the yellow August afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat"
4815,"“I do not like patchwork,” said Anne dolefully, hunting out her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh"
4816,"It belongs to Mr. William Bell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch trees—the most romantic spot, Marilla"
4817,There’s a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful
4818,"but she thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat, above her good brown satin dress, even although she could not see it"
4819,I thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones
4820,When her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed Marilla remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black lace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning from the Ladies’ Aid
4821,"As Marilla lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that clustered thickly about the window, struck upon something caught in the shawl—something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light"
4822,"“Anne Shirley,” said Marilla solemnly, “I’ve just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl"
4823,Beyond Willowmere came Violet Vale—a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr. Andrew Bell’s big woods
4824,"It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches, white stemmed and lissom boughed;"
4825,"Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet—which, with Anne and Diana, happened about once in a blue moon"
4826,She’s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly
4827,But Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate and when Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled;
4828,Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with ‘May I see you home?’ on it
4829,"“Nonsense,” said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played such havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured on the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices"
4830,I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all
4831,"She had a good chance to do so, for the said Gilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat"
4832,"He was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile"
4833,"Mr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to Prissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their slates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle"
4834,"With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes fixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west window afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions"
4835,"She should look at him, that red-haired Shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren’t like the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school"
4836,"Gilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne’s long red braid, held it out at arm’s length and said in a piercing whisper:"
4837,When school was dismissed Anne marched out with her red head held high
4838,” But spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling;
4839,"Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down, told the others going home from school that she’d “acksually never seen anything like it—it was so white, with awful little red spots in it"
4840,"Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, “You are sweet,” and slipped it under the curve of Anne’s arm"
4841,"Whereupon Anne arose, took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the floor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert"
4842,"She learned her lessons at home, did her chores, and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights;"
4843,"OCTOBER was a beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green, while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths"
4844,I’m going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table
4845,You’ll put down the old brown tea set
4846,But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves
4847,Only it begins with an R and a C and it’s bright red color
4848,"I love bright red drinks, don’t you?"
4849,"The orchard, with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit, proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it, sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples and talking as hard as they could"
4850,and Mattie Andrews had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were perfectly sickening;
4851,"but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow, whichever they wanted to be, so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples"
4852,Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word—then
4853,"Mrs. Barry, coming to the door in answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on the doorstep"
4854,Ruby Gillis smuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading;
4855,Ella May MacPherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a floral catalogue—a species of desk decoration much prized in Avonlea school
4856,"Katie Boulter gave her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in, and Julia Bell copied carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the following effusion:"
4857,Anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief
4858,"Charlie Sloane’s slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened with striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary pencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met with a more favorable reception"
4859,I made you one of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper
4860,"now Anne, with a toss of her long red braids, spelled him down"
4861,"Mrs. Rachel Lynde was a red-hot politician and couldn’t have believed that the political rally could be carried through without her, although she was on the opposite side of politics"
4862,A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned Waterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes
4863,"Just as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana Barry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around her head"
4864,"Anne had gone home in the wonderful, white-frosted winter morning, heavy eyed from loss of sleep, but still talking unweariedly to Matthew as they crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of the Lover’s Lane maples"
4865,"I’m so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts, aren’t you?"
4866,"“Well now, I guess you’ll manage all right,” said Matthew, looking at Anne’s white little face and the dark shadows under her eyes"
4867,"Anne accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it was well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and descended to the kitchen where Marilla, who had arrived home in the meantime, was sitting knitting"
4868,"Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself some blue plum preserve out of the pantry"
4869,Not until Anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:
4870,Anne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places
4871,"Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce"
4872,"“I’m perfectly happy—yes, in spite of my red hair"
4873,Just at present I have a soul above red hair
4874,"True, Anne could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain black tam and shapeless, tight-sleeved, homemade gray-cloth coat with Diana’s jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket"
4875,"When Prissy Andrews, attired in a new pink-silk waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white throat and real carnations in her hair—rumor whispered that the master had sent all the way to town for them for her—“climbed the slimy ladder, dark without one ray of light,” Anne shivered in luxurious sympathy;"
4876,"The two little white-clad figures flew down the long room, through the spare-room door, and bounded on the bed at the same moment"
4877,"She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see Diana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror"
4878,"SPRING had come once more to Green Gables—the beautiful capricious, reluctant Canadian spring, lingering along through April and May in a succession of sweet, fresh, chilly days, with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection and growth"
4879,The maples in Lover’s Lane were red budded and little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad’s Bubble
4880,"Away up in the barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane’s place, the Mayflowers blossomed out, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves"
4881,"One June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the Lake of Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover fields and balsamic fir woods, Anne was sitting by her gable window"
4882,"It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to pervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses and ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms on the table"
4883,There’s a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries
4884,I’d be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me
4885,“What would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off?”
4886,A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still
4887,"When she reached Mr. William Bell’s field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of white things, and arrived at the Barry kitchen door so out of breath that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern"
4888,"Anne went back over it with shut eyes, preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing"
4889,"DEAR ME, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as Mrs. Lynde says,” remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books down on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her red eyes with a very damp handkerchief"
4890,Our new minister’s wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses
4891,"but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the corner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and discussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form"
4892,"She talked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they sat on the big red stones by the Dryad’s Bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam"
4893,"We’re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies, and fruit cake, and Marilla’s famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and biscuits as aforesaid;"
4894,"He had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly"
4895,"Anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, “Best Vanilla"
4896,"Anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of “etiquette,” for she came home through the twilight, under a great, high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in a beatified state of mind and told Marilla all about it happily, sitting on the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly head in Marilla’s gingham lap"
4897,A minister mightn’t mind my red hair because he wouldn’t be thinking of such worldly things
4898,"which Ruby Gillis, albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she should tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the aforesaid Carrie Sloane"
4899,Anne tossed her red braids
4900,"Nevertheless, when Diana and the other girls had rushed frantically around the house—except Ruby Gillis, who remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics—they found Anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia creeper"
4901,"“Mr. Barry, what has happened to her?” she gasped, more white and shaken than the self-contained, sensible Marilla had been for many years"
4902,"That night, when Marilla went up to the east gable, where a white-faced girl was lying, a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed"
4903,"When I try to imagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just as he looks in Sunday school, only small"
4904,"IT was October again when Anne was ready to go back to school—a glorious October, all red and gold, with mellow mornings when the valleys were filled with delicate mists as if the spirit of autumn had poured them in for the sun to drain—amethyst, pearl, silver, rose, and smoke-blue"
4905,The Birch Path was a canopy of yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it
4906,"and it was jolly to be back again at the little brown desk beside Diana, with Ruby Gillis nodding across the aisle and Carrie Sloane sending up notes and Julia Bell passing a “chew” of gum down from the back seat"
4907,"’ Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with flowing hair"
4908,"Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie says"
4909,I’m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her slippers because I haven’t any of my own
4910,We are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue-paper roses in them
4911,"He had come into the kitchen, in the twilight of a cold, gray December evening, and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots, unconscious of the fact that Anne and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice of “The Fairy Queen” in the sitting room"
4912,He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen around her that evening—all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white—and he wondered why Marilla always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned
4913,"she was a niece of his wife’s and a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour, big, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile"
4914,“White or brown?” queried Miss Harris patiently
4915,You know I never use it except for the hired man’s porridge or black fruit cake
4916,"I believe a nice rich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria in that’s real pretty"
4917,Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world
4918,It had been a very mild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas;
4920,What makes people call them green?
4921,"Oh, how pretty it was—a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk;"
4922,"Long elbow cuffs, and above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of brown-silk ribbon"
4923,"When the commonplace breakfast was over Diana appeared, crossing the white log bridge in the hollow, a gay little figure in her crimson ulster"
4924,"They’re so white and still, as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams"
4925,Geraldine was a queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes
4926,"“I never saw anybody with purple eyes,” said Diana dubiously"
4927,"She probably imagined that she was thinking about the Aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room, but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the declining sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook, of still, crimson-budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool, of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod"
4928,"Consequently, when Marilla entered her kitchen and found the fire black out, with no sign of Anne anywhere, she felt justly disappointed and irritated"
4929,"Why, it’s green!”"
4930,"Green it might be called, if it were any earthly color—a queer, dull, bronzy green, with streaks here and there of the original red to heighten the ghastly effect"
4931,“I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair
4932,But now I know it’s ten times worse to have green hair
4933,“But I thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair
4934,The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn’t wash off
4935,Diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side
4936,"Now, a red-haired person cannot be a lily maid"
4937,"“Yes, and I think it is real pretty,” said Diana, looking admiringly at the short, silky curls that clustered over Anne’s head and were held in place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow"
4938,"That old black shawl of your mother’s will be just the thing, Diana"
4939,"The black shawl having been procured, Anne spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom, with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast"
4940,"“Oh, she does look really dead,” whispered Ruby Gillis nervously, watching the still, white little face under the flickering shadows of the birches"
4941,"Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none, but an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute"
4942,"A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of Anne’s folded hands was all that could be desired"
4943,"she was white to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession"
4944,"For a moment they stood still, white as sheets, frozen with horror at the tragedy;"
4945,"Anne looked at the wicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and shivered"
4946,"Gilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white scornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also scornful gray eyes"
4947,"Here and there the lane was splashed with it, but for the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples, and the spaces under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy wine"
4948,"“Isn’t this evening just like a purple dream, Diana?"
4949,"Diana shook her head, her black eyes dancing with merriment"
4950,"The dress is very pretty, Diana—navy blue and made so fashionably"
4951,"But Matthew said I must have a new coat, so Marilla bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth, and it’s being made by a real dressmaker over at Carmody"
4952,"It is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage, with gold cord and tassels"
4953,It was delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red sunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields
4954,"” It was quite a fine old mansion, set back from the street in a seclusion of green elms and branching beeches"
4955,Miss Barry met them at the door with a twinkle in her sharp black eyes
4956,Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win
4957,"And I was very glad I didn’t bet, because the red horse did win, and I would have lost ten cents"
4958,"Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin and diamonds"
4959,"When she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of Green Gables winked her a friendly welcome back, and through the open door shone the hearth fire, sending out its warm red glow athwart the chilly autumn night"
4960,"It was nearly dark, for the full November twilight had fallen around Green Gables, and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames in the stove"
4961,"But she had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness"
4962,I think it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last moonlight night and did it
4963,"He’s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps"
4964,"the Queen’s class, left behind in school while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and meadow byways, looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that Latin verbs and French exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they had possessed in the crisp winter months"
4965,Mrs. Rachel and Marilla sat comfortably in the parlor while Anne got the tea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even Mrs. Rachel’s criticism
4966,"But somehow—I don’t know how it is but when Anne and them are together, though she ain’t half as handsome, she makes them look kind of common and overdone—something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big, red peonies, that’s what"
4967,Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then we’ll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher
4968,"Anne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine"
4969,"Anne sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring world, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things upspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her book"
4970,"But she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew’s kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement"
4971,"The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand"
4972,and when she slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and beautiful as maidenhood might desire
4973,"PUT on your white organdy, by all means, Anne,” advised Diana decidedly"
4974,The velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of Anne’s early visions had certainly never materialized;
4975,Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance
4976,"There was no “mahogany furniture,” but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a cushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin, a quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes painted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a low white bed"
4977,"I’m going to braid your hair in two thick braids, and tie them halfway up with big white bows—no, don’t pull out a single curl over your forehead—just have the soft part"
4978,I shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear
4979,"Diana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically, and finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied around Anne’s slim milk-white throat"
4980,And how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the others wore!
4981,She wished herself back in the white room at Green Gables
4982,"She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress"
4983,"and the white-lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the “country bumpkins” and “rustic belles” in the audience, languidly anticipating “such fun” from the displays of local talent on the program"
4984,Anne believed that she would hate that white-lace girl to the end of life
4985,"She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems on her neck and in her dark hair"
4986,"Somehow Anne—who did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace girl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she had—got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front"
4987,"Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement from her “rustic” efforts"
4988,Gilbert was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by Anne’s slender white form and spiritual face against a background of palms in particular
4989,"Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing with shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk"
4990,"“Then don’t disappoint Matthew,” said the pink lady, laughing"
4991,"When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady—who was the wife of an American millionaire—took her under her wing, and introduced her to everybody;"
4992,Even the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment
4993,"He was in waiting for them, with the team, however, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into the calm, white moonshine radiance"
4994,“Titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women
4995,"Would you want to be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life, as if you’d been born turning up your nose at the world?"
4996,"Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so stout and short that you’d really no figure at all?"
4997,More—one evening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate pale green material
4998,The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as Emily’s taste permitted
4999,Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars
5000,"Anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the tall, brown-haired boy across the room;"
5001,I like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist
5002,She looks vivid and red-rosy;
5003,"and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of her own white room at Green Gables, where she would have the pleasant consciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in the garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a vast starry sky, and the light from Diana’s window shining out through the gap in the trees"
5004,"He noticed you in class today, and asked me who the red-headed girl was"
5005,"With the “rose-red” girl, Stella Maynard, and the “dream girl,” Priscilla Grant, she soon became intimate, finding the latter pale spiritual-looking maiden to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun, while the vivid, black-eyed Stella had a heartful of wistful dreams and fancies, as aerial and rainbow-like as Anne’s own"
5006,"The latter was, as she admitted, growing old, but her black eyes were not dim nor the vigor of her tongue in the least abated"
5007,"Girls, sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything, but when I look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and the misty blue air at the end of the streets they don’t seem half so important"
5008,"“That may make me feel badly tomorrow, Josie,” laughed Anne, “but just now I honestly feel that as long as I know the violets are coming out all purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little ferns are poking their heads up in Lovers’ Lane, it’s not a great deal of difference whether I win the Avery or not"
5009,Look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply-dark beech-woods back of Avonlea
5010,"In her own white room, where Marilla had set a flowering house rose on the window sill, Anne looked about her and drew a long breath of happiness"
5011,It’s so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky—and that white orchard and the old Snow Queen
5012,Outside the Snow Queen was mistily white in the moonshine;
5013,"Anne came through the hall, her hands full of white narcissus,—it was long before Anne could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again,—in time to hear her and to see Matthew standing in the porch doorway, a folded paper in his hand, and his face strangely drawn and gray"
5014,the white majesty of death had fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned
5015,"In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin, his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams"
5016,"Anne had gathered them and brought them to him, her anguished, tearless eyes burning in her white face"
5017,"She felt something like shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of gladness when she saw them—that Diana’s visits were pleasant to her and that Diana’s merry words and ways moved her to laughter and smiles—that, in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her heart, that life still called to her with many insistent voices"
5018,“I took a slip of the little white Scotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago;
5019,Perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet him
5020,she said good night and went slowly back to green Gables
5021,"The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions"
5022,"She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it"
5023,"I wonder how the road beyond it goes—what there is of green glory and soft, checkered light and shadows—what new landscapes—what new beauties—what curves and hills and valleys further on"
5024,They liked to sit there when the twilight came down and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled the dewy air
5025,"Mrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the door, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a long breath of mingled weariness and relief"
5026,"“They snapped words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to death"
5027,"He was, by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair"
5028,"Round her thin long neck, which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag, and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy fur cape, yellow with age"
5029,"The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun"
5030,"The furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands—that was all"
5031,"The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his person"
5032,"He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat, with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an iron lock"
5033,"On the counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad"
5034,"He was wearing an old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this last trace of respectability"
5035,"They were fat and red, with black nails"
5036,"When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket, then I had to go"
5037,"(for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man"
5038,"She scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated with disrespect"
5039,"She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl (we have a shawl, made of drap de dames), put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall;"
5040,"“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause—“Since then, owing to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by evil-intentioned persons—in all which Darya Frantsovna took a leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of respect—since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with us"
5041,"the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me"
5042,"She was a rather tall, slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks"
5043,"It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment that he would knock his head against the ceiling"
5044,She set before him her own cracked teapot full of weak and stale tea and laid two yellow lumps of sugar by the side of it
5045,At last he felt cramped and stifled in the little yellow room that was like a cupboard or a box
5046,"she’d live on black bread and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort;"
5047,"The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and moustaches"
5048,"Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies, and children running in the gardens"
5049,"In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never seen"
5050,On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in the shape of a cross
5051,"All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over their shoulders"
5052,"“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with a fleshy face red as a carrot"
5053,"She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded headdress and thick leather shoes;"
5054,"Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky"
5055,"his father’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones, a present from his sister at parting"
5056,"No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact because the old woman is doing harm"
5057,then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it
5058,"there was a good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails"
5059,"At the top, under a white sheet, was a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin;"
5060,The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on the red brocade
5061,"“It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,” the thought passed through his mind;"
5062,"She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet and seeming not to have the strength to cry out"
5063,"“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her"
5064,Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room
5065,"When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair, supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him"
5066,"Raskolnikov, white as a handkerchief, had answered sharply, jerkily, without dropping his black feverish eyes before Ilya Petrovitch’s stare"
5067,the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust
5068,"It was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter, wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol"
5069,"What blood?” he muttered, growing white and turning towards the wall"
5070,She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water
5071,"She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and laziness, and absurdly bashful"
5072,"Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them"
5073,"“No,” said he, “I had not heard,” and all the while he was listening, his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk"
5074,"He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade, light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch"
5075,"Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing painfully"
5076,"a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face"
5077,"Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round and addressed a young fellow in a red shirt who stood gaping before a corn chandler’s shop"
5078,"He looked up, it was the head clerk Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen"
5079,Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth
5080,"When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a sheet and you are gasping for breath!"
5081,"Bending over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal, and the water seemed to catch his attention"
5082,"At last red circles flashed before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes"
5083,"he looked and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow, wasted face and red sunken eyes"
5084,"They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one"
5085,"Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath"
5086,"Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather pretty, with wonderful blue eyes"
5087,her black eyes flashed;
5088,there was a proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness
5089,the full red lower lip projected a little as did her chin;
5090,"He entered looking as black as night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it"
5091,She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a white transparent scarf round her neck
5092,"“Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in everything, indeed!” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother, he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion"
5093,"The ladies slowly followed Razumihin, who went on before, and when they reached the landlady’s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within"
5094,"She could not have been called pretty, but her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help being attracted"
5095,His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look;
5096,"Behind him Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony, with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression"
5097,"Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately recollected himself"
5098,"“I’ll prove to you that your white eyelashes may very well be ascribed to the Church of Ivan the Great’s being two hundred and fifty feet high, and I will prove it clearly, exactly, progressively, and even with a Liberal tendency!"
5099,"Napoleon, the pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with a red trunk under her bed—it’s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to digest!"
5100,"Everything there was as before, the chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames"
5101,She came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train
5102,"Instead of all that, what if it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is?"
5103,"“Pyotr Petrovitch, go away,” she turned to him, white with anger"
5104,"Only now and then Dounia turned white and frowned, remembering what had passed"
5105,But there was a look of sharp determination in his white face
5106,It was an old green house of three storeys
5107,"A plain, deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other flat"
5108,"The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the corners"
5109,"He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that little body still shaking with indignation and anger—and it all seemed to him more and more strange, almost impossible"
5110,"His study was a room neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a bookcase in the corner and several chairs—all government furniture, of polished yellow wood"
5111,His white lips were faintly twitching
5112,The black snake of wounded vanity had been gnawing at his heart all night
5113,"she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she was proud of it"
5114,She stared at the gold eye-glass which Pyotr Petrovitch held in his left hand and at the massive and extremely handsome ring with a yellow stone on his middle finger
5115,"the crockery, knives, forks and glasses were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers, but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna, feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some pride"
5116,"” To make matters worse someone passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread"
5117,"Amalia Ivanovna turned as red as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a father, “but she had a Vater aus Berlin and that he wore a long coat and always said poof-poof-poof!”"
5118,"Sonia ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted something about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat"
5119,"solely, madam, solely, owing to your black ingratitude!"
5120,"She has the yellow passport because my children were starving, she sold herself for us!"
5121,"And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and, wailing and tearful, she ran into the street—with a vague intention of going at once somewhere to find justice"
5122,"He looked at the yellow and tattered paper, at the dust, at his sofa"
5123,"Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way on one side, was really frantic"
5124,The boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk
5125,"she simply had a red knitted cap, or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina Ivanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession"
5126,But at that moment a gentleman in civilian uniform and an overcoat—a solid-looking official of about fifty with a decoration on his neck (which delighted Katerina Ivanovna and had its effect on the policeman)—approached and without a word handed her a green three-rouble note
5127,"When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood that stained the pavement red was from her chest"
5128,"He said this with an air of a sort of gay winking slyness, keeping his eyes fixed on Raskolnikov, who turned white and cold, hearing his own phrases, spoken to Sonia"
5129,"In the room he found also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with ribbons"
5130,"” He poured her out a full glass, and laid down a yellow note"
5131,"white and red, with bright red lips, with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair"
5132,His eyes were somehow too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed
5133,"There happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed wench, whom I had never seen before—she had just come from another village—very pretty, but incredibly stupid:"
5134,"“It cannot be,” muttered Dounia, with white lips"
5135,Her lower lip was white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire
5136,"There was one lanky three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a “Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it"
5137,A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public
5138,"He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry"
5139,"One of them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast"
5140,"The birds were chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin"
5141,The coffin was covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill;
5142,"Among the flowers lay a girl in a white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as though carved out of marble"
5143,"She did not seem afraid of Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big black eyes"
5144,"He suddenly fancied that her long black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little girl were not asleep, but pretending"
5145,"It was the green drap de dames shawl of which Marmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl"
5146,"As he turned into the street he remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped short for a moment"
5147,"Raskolnikov, with white lips and staring eyes, came slowly nearer"
5148,"Could they care so much for a ray of sunshine, for the primeval forest, the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot, which the tramp had marked three years before, and longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush?"
5149,"In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black specks, the nomads’ tents"
5150,She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl;
5151,“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut
5152,"Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames"
5153,"” As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid"
5154,On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion;
5155,"He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message"
5156,Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow’s hand
5157,"At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion’s hand with effusion"
5158,"A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath"
5159,"Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble"
5160,On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle
5161,"It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard"
5162,"In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering"
5163,There was a candle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece—a red wax one—and by its light I saw——”
5164,"He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part muffled round——”"
5165,“A brown overcoat
5166,"“Why, the man in the brown coat—our florid friend with the square toes"
5167,Charles’ head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed volume was struck off
5168,The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed eyes
5169,she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her
5170,"“‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips"
5171,"From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side"
5172,"“I have them,” said Lestrade, producing a small white box;"
5173,"and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust"
5174,"Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali"
5175,"His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones;"
5176,"his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white;"
5177,"Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists"
5178,"” As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother’s care"
5179,"In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach"
5180,"They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them"
5181,"Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings"
5182,"Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic"
5183,"Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion"
5184,"He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode"
5185,"At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts"
5186,"His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat"
5187,"“You shall smart for this!” Stangerson cried, white with rage"
5188,Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head
5189,"With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days"
5190,"The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment—indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days"
5191,"He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning"
5192,"Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier"
5193,"Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life"
5194,"The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way"
5195,"He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing;"
5196,"As Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at the door"
5197,"“Well, every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red complexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin"
5198,"A young and beautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelle’s, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor;"
5199,"her arms, bare to the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her arched and supple foot, so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and blue clocked, stocking"
5200,"instead of the costume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat, a striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons"
5201,"His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings, evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons"
5202,"Then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages, and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North"
5203,"A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth"
5204,"“Never mind, dearest mother,” said a young and lovely girl, with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal, “’tis all my fault for seizing upon M"
5205,"Villefort’s brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched teeth filled Dantès with apprehension"
5206,"” Dantès rose and looked forward, when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which stands the Château d’If"
5207,"Morrel, to aid Dantès, he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection"
5208,", was carelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with gray hair, aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire, and meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius’s rather inaccurate, but much sought-after, edition of Horace—a work which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch"
5209,"” As the police minister related this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker’s lips, turned alternately red and pale"
5210,"He is a man of from fifty to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows, and a thick moustache"
5211,"He was dressed in a blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor"
5212,"In the meanwhile” (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St"
5213,"with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows"
5214,"“In a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the Legion of Honor"
5215,"blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin;"
5216,"took, instead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau;"
5217,"put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned frock-coat, a coat of Villefort’s of dark brown, and cut away in front;"
5218,"Villefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window, put aside the curtain, and saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or three ill-looking men at the corner of the street, who were there, perhaps, to arrest a man with black whiskers, and a blue frock-coat, and hat with broad brim"
5219,"Then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of the portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and calling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was ready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready, learned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached Marseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart of man with ambition and its first successes"
5220,"he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted fish, of black and mouldy bread"
5221,"about the bad quality of the food, about the coldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an excuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer, who out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his prisoner"
5222,"He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black) beard reaching down to his breast"
5223,"Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria, whose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles, while his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair seemed to stand on end"
5224,you will find it has been hollowed out for the purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a red-looking fluid
5225,"Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs"
5226,"Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, “Oh, my friend, my friend, speak not thus!” and then resuming all his presence of mind, which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which had failed at the words of the old man, he said, “Oh, I have saved you once, and I will save you a second time!” And raising the foot of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red liquor"
5227,"Then he thought it was time to make the last trial, and he put the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and without having occasion to force open his jaws, which had remained extended, he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat"
5228,"He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear;"
5229,"By degrees the wind abated, vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars"
5230,"Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded their foaming crests with gold"
5231,"The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel’s keel, floated at the foot of the crag"
5232,"A small white cloud, which had attracted Dantès’ attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the Château d’If"
5233,"The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian’s portraits"
5234,"his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north;"
5235,"His next care on leaving the barber’s who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor’s suit—a garb, as we all know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt, and a cap"
5236,"The sea was calm, and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed beneath a bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights, each of which is a world"
5237,"Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue;"
5238,"The boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast anchor within a cable’s length of shore"
5239,"He saw that he was on the highest point of the island,—a statue on this vast pedestal of granite, nothing human appearing in sight, while the blue ocean beat against the base of the island, and covered it with a fringe of foam"
5240,"But instead of the darkness, and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find, Dantès saw a dim and bluish light, which, as well as the air, entered, not merely by the aperture he had just formed, but by the interstices and crevices of the rock which were visible from without, and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks, and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks"
5241,"As he struck the wall, pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of arabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large white stone"
5242,"afar off, a few small fishing boats studded the bosom of the blue ocean"
5243,"he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked nose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal;"
5244,"His naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his head than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the Spanish muleteers"
5245,"Availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen door, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with the end of his iron-shod stick"
5246,"At this unusual sound, a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode, snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society"
5247,"A deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head"
5248,"Calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black shagreen, the abbé opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of Caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable workmanship"
5249,"The abbé, with a shaking hand, seized a glass of water that was standing by him half-full, swallowed it at one gulp, and then resumed his seat, with red eyes and pale cheeks"
5250,"I have the purse still by me—a large one, made of red silk"
5251,"“In exchange,” he continued, “give me the red silk purse that M"
5252,"Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbé a long purse of faded red silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt"
5253,"“Oh!” he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his head, “we will soon find out"
5254,"The day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken place on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about thirty or two-and-thirty, dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen trousers, and a white waistcoat, having the appearance and accent of an Englishman, presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles"
5255,"Why I think that they are rising faster than they have any business to do, and that they would not be so black if they didn’t mean mischief"
5256,", ask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the apartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk, and give it to your father"
5257,"And, wonderful to see, in front of the tower of Saint-Jean, was a ship bearing on her stern these words, printed in white letters, “The Pharaon, Morrel & Son, of Marseilles"
5258,"As Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with his face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the sentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low tone:"
5259,"Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that red partridges abounded"
5260,"As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like cannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices"
5261,"As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a few fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible"
5262,"at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain, where it paused an instant, like the fiery crest of a volcano, then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base, and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker;"
5263,"It may be supposed, then, Franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission, but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the presence of a man from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a Tunisian costume, that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk tassel, a vest of black cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep red, large and full gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold like the vest, and yellow slippers;"
5264,"his nose, quite straight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek type, while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them"
5265,"At this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a Nubian, black as ebony, and dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining-room"
5266,"“Ah!” responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh, which displayed his white and sharp teeth"
5267,"Such as you see me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day perhaps I shall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert, and the man in the little blue cloak"
5268,"“Well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter"
5269,"but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen before he slept, but a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all the blue of the ocean, all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of the summer breeze;"
5270,"Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in their long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves, and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which saints withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird;"
5271,"He found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky"
5272,"There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow, and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left against the rocks a lace of foam as white as silver"
5273,"When Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon"
5274,"The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand, and the red light of the fire made them look like demons"
5275,"“Luigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road, and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes"
5276,"a cartridge-box worked with gold, and red and green silk;"
5277,"About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof had given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars"
5278,"Around this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile, grew a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while large masses of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm, and hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings"
5279,"He wore a large brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left shoulder, served likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance, while the upper part was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat"
5280,"The lower part of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon, which, entering through the broken ceiling, shed their refulgent beams on feet cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather, over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth"
5281,"should I have obtained the requisite pardon for Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks, and the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked on it"
5282,"“The middle window at the Café Rospoli will be hung with white damask, bearing a red cross"
5283,“Then all three windows will have yellow draperies
5284,"Sometimes she is accompanied by the person who is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black servant"
5285,"Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators, the sage matrons who took their daughters, and the charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said, ‘Come, despatch the dying"
5286,"The side windows were hung with yellow damask, and the centre one with white damask and a red cross"
5287,On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and white satin
5288,"A brotherhood of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth, with holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands lighted tapers, appeared first;"
5289,"He looked at Albert—he was as white as his shirt, and mechanically cast away his cigar, although he had not half smoked it"
5290,"His nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey, and his lips, half opened, disclosed his white teeth, small and sharp like those of a jackal"
5291,his black eyes especially were full of kindness and pity
5292,Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots
5293,"At the centre window, the one hung with white damask with a red cross, was a blue domino, beneath which Franz’s imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek of the Argentina"
5294,"and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys, with spring masks, with which they made grimaces at everyone who passed"
5295,but the count and the blue domino had also disappeared;
5296,"the two windows, hung with yellow damask, were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited"
5297,for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the white curtains?”
5298,“Where was this window with white hangings?” asked the countess
5299,"“Well, did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask, and one with white damask with a red cross?"
5300,"Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress—a jacket and breeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes with buckles, and a silk waistcoat"
5301,"The Turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes, but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin, and their red caps, which make them look like a bottle of wine with a red seal?"
5302,This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the bouquet (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a charming harlequin dressed in rose-colored satin
5303,"and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion"
5304,"There, on a table, surrounded at some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco known,—from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai, and so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico, to Latakia,—was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond;"
5305,"A tall young man, with light hair, clear gray eyes, and thin and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell eye-glass suspended by a silken thread, and which, by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a half-official air, without smiling or speaking"
5306,"“And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your button-hole"
5307,It looks very neat on a black coat buttoned up
5308,"And he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and dignified bearing, with large and open brow, piercing eyes, and black moustache, whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles, under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten"
5309,"everyone has not black slaves, a princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an Arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and Greek mistresses"
5310,"“facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead, livid complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness unexceptionable"
5311,"At this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy, but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a pace forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks"
5312,"Delacroix’s Arabian cavaliers, with their long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked arms, their horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces;"
5313,"She wore the picturesque costume of the Catalan fisherwomen, a red and black bodice, and golden pins in her hair"
5314,"She was looking at the sea, and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky"
5315,"He was a man of forty to forty-five years, but he seemed at least fifty, and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white hair, which was cut short, in the military fashion"
5316,"“No, no, Albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and orange-flowers throw out at first, before one is used to them, such violent perfumes"
5317,"Its purple visage, and its violet-colored hands showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not yet cold, I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet"
5318,"He was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes, of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion;"
5319,"“Caderousse took from his pocket a small case of black shagreen, opened, and gave it to the jeweller"
5320,‘I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed;
5321,"“A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the small shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the diamond,—seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in, then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he deposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round his head"
5322,"The count hastily descended, presented himself at the already opened carriage door, and held out his hand to a young woman, completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with gold"
5323,"About two o’clock the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of magnificent English horses, stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a person, dressed in a blue coat, with buttons of a similar color, a white waistcoat, over which was displayed a massive gold chain, brown trousers, and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his features—a person, in a word, who, although evidently past fifty, desired to be taken for not more than forty, bent forwards from the carriage door, on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to inquire at the porter’s lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there, and if he were within"
5324,"while the flatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the back of his skull, which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears, combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the red ribbon that depended from his button-hole"
5325,"Having delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree of energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous furnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the Chaussée d’Antin"
5326,"With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded armchair, covered with white satin embroidered with gold"
5327,"The baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments, in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame Danglars—a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered with white Indian muslin"
5328,"Ere long a carriage will dash past here, drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday;"
5329,"A mass of straight black hair, defying all attempts to train or curl it, fell over his projecting forehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment"
5330,"Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they darted forward like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate, that there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress, when a strange-looking man,—an Arab, a negro, or a Nubian, at least a black of some nation or other—at a signal from the count, whose domestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals, even at the risk of being trampled to death himself;"
5331,"de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of Héloïse to the letter,—donned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves, ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery, and drove that same night to No"
5332,"He dressed entirely in black, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance was only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush"
5333,"Haydée was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin spotted with silver;"
5334,"Her dress, which was that of the women of Epirus, consisted of a pair of white satin trousers, embroidered with pink roses, displaying feet so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair, that they might well have been taken for Parian marble, had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes, beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls"
5335,"She wore a blue and white-striped vest, with long open sleeves, trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice, which, closing only from the centre to the waist, exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper part of the bosom;"
5336,"while on the other a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue"
5337,"“My father had a long white beard, but I loved him;"
5338,"The house was of white stone, and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers"
5339,"the salon in mahogany, and the furnishings were of blue velvet;"
5341,"A few locks of gray mingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics"
5342,"The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by, and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains"
5343,"“No, no,” returned Monte Cristo, pale as death, pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings, while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover, beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion"
5344,"About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood, where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the wide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate, that dated from the time of Louis XIII"
5345,"He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but his carefully arranged hair, beard and moustache, all of the richest and glossiest black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire"
5346,"But the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and observed the fluttering of the blue sash"
5347,"Valentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother"
5348,"Her white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan"
5349,"as for Mademoiselle Eugénie, she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage"
5350,"You must know I felt so interested in the splendid roan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake;"
5351,"Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object I met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket!"
5352,"So saying, Haydée arose, and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral, she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act"
5353,"“Let them all be taken away and changed, then, with the exception of the sleeping-chamber which is hung with red damask;"
5354,"The visitor was about fifty-two years of age, dressed in one of the green surtouts, ornamented with black frogs, which have so long maintained their popularity all over Europe"
5355,"He wore trousers of blue cloth, boots tolerably clean, but not of the brightest polish, and a little too thick in the soles, buckskin gloves, a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes, and a black cravat striped with white, which, if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will, might have passed for a halter, so much did it resemble one"
5356,"The small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray moustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had received an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was awaiting him in the hall"
5357,"“Into the blue drawing-room, according to your excellency’s orders"
5358,"He was certainly the tall young man with light hair, red beard, black eyes, and brilliant complexion, whom his master had so particularly described to him"
5359,"Your history is quite a romance, and the world, which delights in romances in yellow covers, strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment, even though they be gilded like yourself"
5360,"black trousers, patent leather boots, white waistcoat, either a black or blue coat, and a long cravat"
5361,"idolized by Edward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count’s large black eyes, runs to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he is sure to find some delightful present,—M"
5362,"while in his eyes, shaded by thick black lashes, was concentrated, as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the others, all the activity, address, force, and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body;"
5363,"it was very evident that something desperate was passing in the old man’s mind, for a cry of anger and grief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance, appeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple with the struggle"
5364,"I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on a hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every direction, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I assure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should be made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the distance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting at a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the opposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the part of the sender of the message"
5365,"Now, it never occurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects, with their long black claws, for I always feared to find under their stone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals, factions, and government intrigues"
5366,"But one fine day I learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred francs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the heavens like an astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler, or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the country around him, but all his monotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied, black-clawed fellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him"
5367,"It is the insect with black claws, and the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance"
5368,"when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers"
5369,"The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel, edged by a border of thick box, of many years’ growth, and of a tone and color that would have delighted the heart of Delacroix, our modern Rubens"
5370,"the earth, black as soot, the thick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence;"
5371,” And he glanced timidly at the count’s blue coat
5372,"red with fever, while the large drops fell from his brow, the man executed, one after the other, the three signs given by the count, in spite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand correspondent, who, not understanding the change, began to think the gardener had gone mad"
5373,"one division was entirely devoted to novels, and even the volume which had been published but the day before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and gold binding"
5374,"Meanwhile, Danglars, who had cared little for curiosities, was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange-tree, one after another"
5375,"When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at the cactus;"
5376,"but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree, pricked him dreadfully"
5377,"A black satin stock, fresh from the maker’s hands, gray moustaches, a bold eye, a major’s uniform, ornamented with three medals and five crosses—in fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldier—such was the appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father with whom we are already acquainted"
5378,“The one with a white dress and so many diamonds—the fair one
5379,"Andrea Cavalcanti, the young man in a black coat, looking at Murillo’s ‘Madonna’;"
5380,"“There was, above all, one room,” continued Monte Cristo, “very plain in appearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not why, appeared to me quite dramatic"
5381,"“I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but certainly everything appears to me black in this house,” said Debray"
5382,"And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess Lucina?"
5383,and she passed over to Monte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the count had tested on Edward
5384,Monte Cristo dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips;
5385,"But instead of either of these, he saw nothing but a strange face, sunburnt, and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as carbuncles, and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth, pointed and sharp as the wolf’s or jackal’s"
5386,A red handkerchief encircled his gray head;
5387,"“Pardon me, my friend, if I disturb you,” said the man with the red handkerchief, “but I want to speak to you"
5388,"with this red handkerchief on my head, with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my pocket, without reckoning what was there before—making in all about two hundred francs,—why, I should certainly be arrested at the barriers"
5389,"Andrea’s hand left his pocket inoffensively, and was carried up to the red moustache, which it played with for some time"
5390,"and the proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the florins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have become reflected in them"
5391,"As soon as she was seated in the vehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil, which she tied on to her straw bonnet"
5392,"She then replaced the bonnet, and saw with pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her white complexion and brilliant eyes were alone visible"
5393,"“You recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that bed in the red damask room, while I, scarcely less agitated than you, awaited your delivery"
5394,"I ascended into the red room, and waited for night"
5395,"I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I drew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found in my coat—that little key we both used to cherish so much, which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring—when I opened the door, and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral staircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly shrieked"
5396,"“Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie, and speaks of his family"
5397,"A bed without curtains, four armchairs, and a couch, covered with yellow Utrecht velvet, composed, with a prie-Dieu, all its furniture"
5398,"At the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage, which, instead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Férou, drove up to the green door"
5399,red and black tapestry—such was the appearance of Lord Wilmore’s drawing-room
5400,"He was dressed with all the English peculiarity, namely, in a blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar, in the fashion of , a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen pantaloons, three inches too short, but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee"
5401,"Lord Wilmore, having heard the door close after him, returned to his bedroom, where with one hand he pulled off his light hair, his red whiskers, his false jaw, and his wound, to resume the black hair, dark complexion, and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte Cristo"
5402,"Until now, it had been undecided whether the supper should take place in the dining-room, or under a long tent erected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with stars, had settled the question in favor of the lawn"
5403,"see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a bouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis"
5404,"Just then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and glossy moustache, respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort"
5405,"turning around, he saw near the door a beautiful fair face, whose large blue eyes were, without any marked expression, fixed upon him, while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her lips"
5406,it was not the plain white waistcoat;
5407,"it was not the trousers, that displayed the foot so perfectly formed—it was none of these things that attracted the attention,—it was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his calm and serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth, chiselled with such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such high disdain,—these were what fixed the attention of all upon him"
5408,“And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?”
5409,“The one in the dark blue coat?”
5410,"The white hair was thrown back from her yellow forehead, and her eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief"
5411,"It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my body, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and what will appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes shut, in the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner where there is a door leading into Madame Villefort’s dressing-room—I saw, I tell you, silently enter, a white figure"
5412,"I saw a white figure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one of my senses, I heard my glass removed—the same which is there now on the table"
5413,"The garden became darker still, but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress, and in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps"
5414,"Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on days of ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a cloud, which at that moment obscured the moon’s feeble light"
5415,Another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villefort’s bedroom
5416,"As he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red curtains and the three windows with white curtains"
5417,"This double error became an irresistible reality, and by one of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his hiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the risk of alarming Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the flower-garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white lake, and having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in front of the house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the door, which opened without offering any resistance"
5418,"At the other end of the room, under a white sheet which covered it, lay the corpse, still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly overheard"
5419,"de Villefort, and he thought he could see through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the purple lips"
5420,"The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones, about twenty feet high;"
5421,"Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her temples, round her eyes and down her cheeks"
5422,"Barrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a bundle of papers tied with a black string"
5423,"The ground from the steps to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost, the water of the river looked black and deep"
5424,"Cavalcanti, dressed in black, like one of Goethe’s heroes, with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked stockings, passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his light hair, and so displayed a sparkling diamond, that in spite of Monte Cristo’s advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on his little finger"
5425,"my mother was at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle, or with the diamond-hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle"
5426,"As for me, I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young soldier, and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world, I am quite sure I shall recognize Selim"
5427,"My father was endeavoring to pierce with his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon, examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake, while my mother, reclining by his side, rested her head on his shoulder, and I played at his feet, admiring everything I saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves, but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest importance"
5428,"the castle of Yanina rose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake, and the immense masses of black vegetation which, viewed in the distance, gave the idea of lichens clinging to the rocks, were in reality gigantic fir-trees and myrtles"
5429,"She prepared the iced water which he was in the habit of constantly drinking,—for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever,—after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his chibouque, which he sometimes smoked for hours together, quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere"
5430,"At first they appeared like black specks, and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves"
5431,"and her eyes gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina, which, like a magic mirror, seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched"
5432,"Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their way into this gloomy retreat"
5433,"At the same moment, that is, at nine o’clock in the morning, Albert de Morcerf, dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin, might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of Monte Cristo’s house in the Champs-Élysées"
5434,"Barrois took the glass, and, raising it to his purple lips, took about half of the liquid offered him"
5435,"It restores the blue color of litmus-paper reddened by an acid, and it turns syrup of violets green"
5436,"this sediment first took a blue shade, then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and from opal to emerald"
5437,"Andrea Cavalcanti, with curled hair, moustaches in perfect order, and white gloves which fitted admirably, had entered the courtyard of the banker’s house in Rue de la Chaussée d’Antin"
5438,"“And,” added he, biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread, “I have formed a plan"
5439,He fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white paper and pen and ink
5440,"“In the court are orange-trees in pots, turf, and clumps of flowers"
5441,"It was an order the count had just given, for immediately Ali went noiselessly, and returned, bearing a black dress and a three-cornered hat"
5442,"I shall faint again!” Monte Cristo approached, and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the contents of the phial"
5443,"” Monte Cristo took off the wig which disfigured him, and let fall his black hair, which added so much to the beauty of his pallid features"
5444,"“Oh?” said Caderousse, thunderstruck, “but for that black hair, I should say you were the Englishman, Lord Wilmore"
5445,I have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of the other;
5446,"This child of the desert was in his element, and with his black face and sparkling eyes appeared, in the cloud of dust he raised, like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane"
5447,"his eyes burned under the blue-veined lids, and he tottered like a drunken man"
5448,"he raised his face, red with shame and bathed in tears, and seizing Beauchamp’s arm:"
5449,"While he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,—wretched waking dreams of grief,—the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and shone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his justification of Providence"
5450,"“And besides,” said Beauchamp, “with a collar above his cravat, an open coat and white waistcoat!"
5451,"He was pale, and his eyes were red and swollen;"
5452,"Then he took away his mother’s portrait, with its oaken frame, leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty"
5453,"“Oh, feel for me, who could offer millions to that poor woman, but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved"
5454,"Ten minutes afterwards, General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black coat with a military collar, black pantaloons, and black gloves"
5455,"He leaped towards a dressing-room near his bedroom, and in less than a moment, tearing off his cravat, his coat and waistcoat, he put on a sailor’s jacket and hat, from beneath which rolled his long black hair"
5456,"her eyes were more brilliant than ever, and her hands, which were generally white like mother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a yellowish hue"
5457,"you have turned pale and then red successively, three or four times in one minute"
5458,"He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time, when the door opened and Eugénie appeared, attired in a figured black satin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the Italian Opera"
5459,"it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and devoted daughter” (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of the young girl), “to practice obedience"
5460,"Under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows, he prudently turned away, and calmed himself immediately, daunted by the power of a resolute mind"
5461,"Mademoiselle Eugénie was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half concealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied by a single jewel"
5462,The count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity;
5463,his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his face
5464,"His only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat"
5465,"When this was done, Eugénie opened a drawer, of which she kept the key, and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak"
5466,"“but that beautiful black hair, those magnificent braids, which made all the ladies sigh with envy,—will they go under a man’s hat like the one I see down there?”"
5467,"They never overtook the chimerical friend, yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green cabriolet and bay horse;"
5468,"but for one who has a timid conscience, and with good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white uniform is really very alarming"
5469,"Not only was the first gendarme still there, but the young man now perceived a second yellow, blue, and white uniform at the foot of the staircase, the only one by which he could descend, while a third, on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was posted as a sentinel at the great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress"
5470,"but soon a ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind, and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid cheeks"
5471,"At the precise time when Madame Danglars, dressed in black and concealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to Debray’s apartments, notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young man was not at home, Debray was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the terrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the family, to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions"
5472,"Meanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of Debray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers, which she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed, Debray had himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was half excused in the eyes of the poor woman"
5473,"look at my face, paler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness—for four days I have not closed them, for I have been constantly watching you, to protect and preserve you for Maximilian"
5474,"But drink some of this;” and the count took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which he poured a few drops into the glass"
5475,"“And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of dried orange-peel?”"
5476,She saw a woman in a white dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass
5477,"“Do you recollect in the arbor of the Hôtel des Postes, at Perugia, seeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana?"
5478,"Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,—for she felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage,—and began to pray, and while uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot that her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair, and that the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her nightdress"
5479,"the white lips no longer quivered—the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor, and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax"
5480,"Astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm was still hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and for the first time noticed the white lips"
5481,"He saw as though in a mist, a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery"
5482,"The weather was dull and stormy, a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees, and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards"
5483,Black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues;
5484,"but it was locked, Maximilian was shut in, and it was impossible to see what was passing in the room, because a red curtain was drawn before the glass"
5485,"This was a man whose face the concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen’s coachmen on a cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he approached the door"
5486,"Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house, a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress, and always thickly veiled;"
5487,the walls were hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt;
5488,"“Well, be it so—let us part,” said Mercédès, folding around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away, and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere"
5489,"“if he had only a comb and hair-grease, he’d take the shine off the gentlemen in white kids"
5490,"And Andrea, gliding through the court like a black shadow, rushed out through the wicket, leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in wonder"
5491,"Noirtier at one of the open windows, where the old man had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat, and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony"
5492,"The morning dawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon the lines he had traced in red ink"
5493,"its flickerings awoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in blood"
5494,"a bright yellow streak crossed the sky, and seemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood out in black relief on the horizon"
5495,"His hands, gracefully placed, one upon his hat, the other in the opening of his white waistcoat, were not at all tremulous;"
5496,"de Villefort pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at first pale, had become red and burning;"
5497,", Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;"
5498,"“Oh!” he exclaimed, as though a red-hot iron were piercing his heart"
5499,Speak!” The young woman extended her stiff white hands towards him
5500,"Through the open door was visible a portion of the boudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch"
5501,"“No!” The abbé threw off his wig, shook his head, and his hair, no longer confined, fell in black masses around his manly face"
5502,“It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black cloud
5503,"It yet stood, under the shade of the fine avenue of lime-trees, which forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of Marseilles, covered by an immense vine, which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the stone front, burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south"
5504,"he looked in the direction whence it came, and there under an arbor of Virginia jessamine, with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers, he saw Mercédès seated, with her head bowed, and weeping bitterly"
5505,"The sun, red and flaming, was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean"
5506,"while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen’s boats, white and graceful as the sea-gull, or the merchant vessels bound for Corsica or Spain"
5507,"He had almost forgotten his name and face, but at the mention of the name he recalled his person as he used to see it, the face encircled by a beard, wearing the brown jacket, the bunch of keys, the jingling of which he still seemed to hear"
5508,"On the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription, the white letters of which were still visible on the green wall:"
5509,The white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney
5510,"The walls were hollowed out in sepulchres, one above the other, and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their large dark eyes, like those which we see on the faces of the dead"
5511,"To a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet drapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the room, the appearance of the whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable dream"
5512,his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his shoulders
5513,"at the same time, as though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man took some black bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he began devouring voraciously"
5514,"an opal-colored light, through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays, descended on the blue ocean"
5515,"The traveller descended, and instead of sitting down at the stern of the boat, which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation, stood up with his arms crossed"
5516,"At the same time the count appeared to increase in stature, his form, nearly double its usual height, stood out in relief against the red tapestry, his black hair was thrown back, and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel"
5517,"The eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor, and on the blue line separating the sky from the Mediterranean Sea, they perceived a large white sail"
5518,"The Carolina—not Virginia—jessamine, gelsemium sempervirens (properly speaking not a jessamine at all) has yellow blossoms"
5519,"He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue neckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a flaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man"
5520,"His black hair, fine as floss silk, hung in glossy curls about his round, dimpled face, while a pair of large dark eyes, full of fire and softness, looked out from beneath the rich, long lashes, as he peered curiously into the apartment"
5521,"A gay robe of scarlet and yellow plaid, carefully made and neatly fitted, set off to advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty;"
5522,the same ripples of silky black hair
5523,"The brown of her complexion gave way on the cheek to a perceptible flush, which deepened as she saw the gaze of the strange man fixed upon her in bold and undisguised admiration"
5524,"These critters ain’t like white folks, you know;"
5525,"’Tan’t, you know, as if it was white folks, that’s brought up in the way of ’spectin’ to keep their children and wives, and all that"
5526,"and so they were married in her mistress’ great parlor, and her mistress herself adorned the bride’s beautiful hair with orange-blossoms, and threw over it the bridal veil, which certainly could scarce have rested on a fairer head;"
5527,"and there was no lack of white gloves, and cake and wine,—of admiring guests to praise the bride’s beauty, and her mistress’ indulgence and liberality"
5528,"“Why—but you were married to me, by the minister, as much as if you’d been a white man!” said Eliza, simply"
5529,"” A round, black, shining face is hers, so glossy as to suggest the idea that she might have been washed over with white of eggs, like one of her own tea rusks"
5530,"On a rough bench in the corner, a couple of woolly-headed boys, with glistening black eyes and fat shining cheeks, were busy in superintending the first walking operations of the baby, which, as is usually the case, consisted in getting up on its feet, balancing a moment, and then tumbling down,—each successive failure being violently cheered, as something decidedly clever"
5531,"“How easy white folks al’us does things!” said Aunt Chloe, pausing while she was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her fork, and regarding young Master George with pride"
5532,"and, finally, I got kinder sarcy, and, says I, ’Now, Missis, do jist look at dem beautiful white hands o’ yourn with long fingers, and all a sparkling with rings, like my white lilies when de dew ’s on ’em;"
5533,and look at my great black stumpin hands
5534,“Can’t ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye?
5535,"The room was soon filled with a motley assemblage, from the old gray-headed patriarch of eighty, to the young girl and lad of fifteen"
5536,"A little harmless gossip ensued on various themes, such as where old Aunt Sally got her new red headkerchief, and how “Missis was a going to give Lizzy that spotted muslin gown, when she’d got her new berage made up;” and how Mas’r Shelby was thinking of buying a new sorrel colt, that was going to prove an addition to the glories of the place"
5537,"One old gray-headed woman, long past work, but much revered as a sort of chronicle of the past, rose, and leaning on her staff, said—“Well, chil’en!"
5538,“Won’t he swar!” said little black Jake
5539,"” And Mandy, who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she had heard, more than a black cat, now took airs of superior wisdom, and strutted about, forgetting to state that, though actually coiled up among the jugs at the time specified, she had been fast asleep all the time"
5540,"Black Sam, as he was commonly called, from his being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place, was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings, with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal well-being, that would have done credit to any white patriot in Washington"
5541,"“but can’t ye see through a ladder, ye black nigger?"
5542,"“Ho, ho!” said Sam, “skeery, ar ye?” and his black visage lighted up with a curious, mischievous gleam"
5543,"Haley’s horse, which was a white one, and very fleet and spirited, appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto;"
5544,"As she was also so white as not to be known as of colored lineage, without a critical survey, and her child was white also, it was much easier for her to pass on unsuspected"
5545,"The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked as her weight came on it, but she staid there not a moment"
5546,"The best I can do is to tell ye to go thar,” said he, pointing to a large white house which stood by itself, off the main street of the village"
5547,"The gray mist of evening, rising slowly from the river, enveloped her as she disappeared up the bank, and the swollen current and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her and her pursuer"
5548,"The woman opened to him the door of a little parlor, covered with a rag carpet, where stood a table with a very shining black oil-cloth, sundry lank, high-backed wood chairs, with some plaster images in resplendent colors on the mantel-shelf, above a very dimly-smoking grate;"
5549,"He was short and slender, lithe and catlike in his motions, and had a peering, mousing expression about his keen black eyes, with which every feature of his face seemed sharpened into sympathy;"
5550,"his sleek, thin, black hair was stuck eagerly forward, and all his motions and evolutions expressed a dry, cautious acuteness"
5551,white and handsome—well brought up
5552,"Marks had got from his pocket a greasy pocket-book, and taking a long paper from thence, he sat down, and fixing his keen black eyes on it, began mumbling over its contents:"
5553,"Mrs. Bird was a timid, blushing little woman, of about four feet in height, and with mild blue eyes, and a peach-blow complexion, and the gentlest, sweetest voice in the world;—as for courage, a moderate-sized cock-turkey had been known to put her to rout at the very first gobble, and a stout house-dog, of moderate capacity, would bring her into subjection merely by a show of his teeth"
5554,"On the present occasion, Mrs. Bird rose quickly, with very red cheeks, which quite improved her general appearance, and walked up to her husband, with quite a resolute air, and said, in a determined tone,"
5555,"At this critical juncture, old Cudjoe, the black man-of-all-work, put his head in at the door, and wished “Missis would come into the kitchen;” and our senator, tolerably relieved, looked after his little wife with a whimsical mixture of amusement and vexation, and, seating himself in the arm-chair, began to read the papers"
5556,"“Your heart is better than your head, in this case, John,” said the wife, laying her little white hand on his"
5557,"In process of time, the rains wash off all the turf and grass aforesaid, move the logs hither and thither, in picturesque positions, up, down and crosswise, with divers chasms and ruts of black mud intervening"
5558,"He was a great, tall, bristling Orson of a fellow, full six feet and some inches in his stockings, and arrayed in a red flannel hunting-shirt"
5559,"I tell ye what, these yer things make me come the nighest to swearin’, now, o’ most anything,” said honest John, as he wiped his eyes with the back of a great, freckled, yellow hand"
5560,The February morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of Uncle Tom’s cabin
5561,"and their descendant to this day always acts as if the house were his camp,—wears his hat at all hours, tumbles himself about, and puts his heels on the tops of chairs or mantelpieces, just as his father rolled on the green sward, and put his upon trees and logs,—keeps all the windows and doors open, winter and summer, that he may get air enough for his great lungs,—calls everybody “stranger,” with nonchalant bonhommie, and is altogether the frankest, easiest, most jovial creature living"
5562,"Said George six feet in height, a very light mulatto, brown curly hair;"
5563,"is very intelligent, speaks handsomely, can read and write, will probably try to pass for a white man, is deeply scarred on his back and shoulders, has been branded in his right hand with the letter H"
5564,"He was very tall, with a dark, Spanish complexion, fine, expressive black eyes, and close-curling hair, also of a glossy blackness"
5565,"“A little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown, and I’ve dyed my hair black;"
5566,"We remark, en passant, that George was, by his father’s side, of white descent"
5567,"This speech, delivered partly while sitting at the table, and partly walking up and down the room,—delivered with tears, and flashing eyes, and despairing gestures,—was altogether too much for the good-natured old body to whom it was addressed, who had pulled out a great yellow silk pocket-handkerchief, and was mopping up his face with great energy"
5568,"And this black fellow,—who is he?”"
5569,"and the tears that fell, as he spoke, came as naturally as if he had been a white man"
5570,"As the boat stopped, a black woman came running wildly up the plank, darted into the crowd, flew up to where the slave gang sat, and threw her arms round that unfortunate piece of merchandise before enumerate—“John, aged thirty,” and with sobs and tears bemoaned him as her husband"
5571,"To him, it looked like something unutterably horrible and cruel, because, poor, ignorant black soul!"
5572,"Something black passed quickly by him to the side of the boat, and he heard a splash in the water"
5573,"A large, roomy, neatly-painted kitchen, its yellow floor glossy and smooth, and without a particle of dust;"
5574,"glossy green wood chairs, old and firm;"
5575,"The snowy lisse crape cap, made after the strait Quaker pattern,—the plain white muslin handkerchief, lying in placid folds across her bosom,—the drab shawl and dress,—showed at once the community to which she belonged"
5576,"Her hair, partially silvered by age, was parted smoothly back from a high placid forehead, on which time had written no inscription, except peace on earth, good will to men, and beneath shone a large pair of clear, honest, loving brown eyes;"
5577,"At this moment, the door opened, and Mary, an honest, rosy-looking girl, with large brown eyes, like her mother’s, came in with the baby"
5578,"“To be sure, he does,” said little bustling Ruth, as she took the child, and began taking off a little blue silk hood, and various layers and wrappers of outer garments;"
5579,"Baby seemed quite used to this mode of proceeding, for he put his thumb in his mouth (as if it were quite a thing of course), and seemed soon absorbed in his own reflections, while the mother seated herself, and taking out a long stocking of mixed blue and white yarn, began to knit with briskness"
5580,"She gave such a bound from the floor, as she clapped her little hands, that two stray curls fell from under her Quaker cap, and lay brightly on her white neckerchief"
5581,"and was conscious of a kind of sunshine beaming down upon her from her large, clear, brown eyes"
5582,It was the first time that ever George had sat down on equal terms at any white man’s table;
5583,"The shape of her head and the turn of her neck and bust was peculiarly noble, and the long golden-brown hair that floated like a cloud around it, the deep spiritual gravity of her violet blue eyes, shaded by heavy fringes of golden brown,—all marked her out from other children, and made every one turn and look after her, as she glided hither and thither on the boat"
5584,"and there was not a corner or nook, above or below, where those fairy footsteps had not glided, and that visionary golden head, with its deep blue eyes, fleeted along"
5585,"and whenever her golden head and deep blue eyes peered out upon him from behind some dusky cotton-bale, or looked down upon him over some ridge of packages, he half believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his New Testament"
5586,"There was the same noble cast of head, the same large blue eyes, the same golden-brown hair;"
5587,"In the large, clear blue eyes, though in form and color exactly similar, there was wanting that misty, dreamy depth of expression;"
5588,"“All the moral and Christian virtues bound in black Morocco, complete!” he said, when Haley had finished"
5589,"“Poor fellow!” said the young man, fixing his keen, mocking blue eye on him;"
5590,“the country is almost ruined with pious white people;
5591,"them ar an’t no account, in black or white;—but these rayly is;"
5592,"But the real remained,—the real, like the flat, bare, oozy tide-mud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding boats and white-winged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has gone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare,—exceedingly real"
5593,"A life of constant inaction, bodily and mental,—the friction of ceaseless ennui and discontent, united to the ordinary weakness which attended the period of maternity,—in course of a few years changed the blooming young belle into a yellow faded, sickly woman, whose time was divided among a variety of fanciful diseases, and who considered herself, in every sense, the most ill-used and suffering person in existence"
5594,"The old gray-headed father took down Morse’s Atlas out of the book-case, and looked out the exact latitude and longitude;"
5595,"Miss Ophelia, as you now behold her, stands before you, in a very shining brown linen travelling-dress, tall, square-formed, and angular"
5596,"there’s the spotted carpet-bag and the little blue band-box with your best bonnet,—that’s two;"
5597,"he couldn’t have fallen over, now,—but something must have happened;”—and just as she had begun to work herself into a real distress, he came up, with his usually careless motion, and giving Eva a quarter of the orange he was eating, said,"
5598,"and this, again, was surrounded by turf, smooth as green velvet, while a carriage-drive enclosed the whole"
5599,"Two large orange-trees, now fragrant with blossoms, threw a delicious shade;"
5600,"a passion which, rudely indulged by an untrained taste, draws on them the ridicule of the colder and more correct white race"
5601,"Clare, who was in heart a poetical voluptuary, smiled as Miss Ophelia made her remark on his premises, and, turning to Tom, who was standing looking round, his beaming black face perfectly radiant with admiration, he said,"
5602,"Clare turned round from paying the hackman, there was nobody in view but Mr. Adolph himself, conspicuous in satin vest, gold guard-chain, and white pants, and bowing with inexpressible grace and suavity"
5603,"she was dressed neatly, with a high red and yellow turban on her head, the recent gift of Eva, and which the child had been arranging on her head"
5604,"She has her strong coffee or her tea every day, with white sugar in it"
5605,"his stories are wonders in her eyes, his songs and Methodist hymns are better than an opera, and the traps and little bits of trash in his pocket a mine of jewels, and he the most wonderful Tom that ever wore a black skin"
5606,"Tom, therefore, in his well-brushed broadcloth suit, smooth beaver, glossy boots, faultless wristbands and collar, with his grave, good-natured black face, looked respectable enough to be a Bishop of Carthage, as men of his color were, in other ages"
5607,"The afternoon shadows stretched eastward, and the round red sun stood thoughtfully on the horizon, and his beams shone yellow and calm into the little bed-room where George and his wife were sitting"
5608,"Phineas was tall and lathy, red-haired, with an expression of great acuteness and shrewdness in his face"
5609,"The women heard it, and, looking anxiously out, saw, far in the rear, on the brow of a distant hill, a party of men looming up against the red-streaked sky of early dawn"
5610,"Another hill, and their pursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon, whose white cloth-covered top made it conspicuous at some distance, and a loud yell of brutal triumph came forward on the wind"
5611,"This isolated pile, or range of rocks, rose up black and heavy against the brightening sky, and seemed to promise shelter and concealment"
5612,"Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat down the boy on a smooth, flat platform of crisp white moss, that covered the top of the rock"
5613,"His wound was carefully dressed and bandaged, and he lay languidly opening and shutting his eyes on the white window-curtains and gently-gliding figures of his sick room, like a weary child"
5614,"“Shif’less!” said Miss Ophelia to herself, proceeding to tumble over the drawer, where she found a nutmeg-grater and two or three nutmegs, a Methodist hymn-book, a couple of soiled Madras handkerchiefs, some yarn and knitting-work, a paper of tobacco and a pipe, a few crackers, one or two gilded china-saucers with some pomade in them, one or two thin old shoes, a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small white onions, several damask table-napkins, some coarse crash towels, some twine and darning-needles, and several broken papers, from which sundry sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer"
5615,"I was just dying to know whether you would appear in your pink tarletane,” said Adolph"
5616,"“cuttin’ round, makin’ b’lieve you’s white folks"
5617,“an’t thar where white folks is gwine?
5618,"His large blue eyes flashed, and he gestured with an unconscious eagerness"
5619,"He had black, fiery eyes, coal-black hair, a strong, fine Roman profile, and a rich brown complexion"
5620,"I had blue eyes, golden hair, a Greek outline, and fair complexion"
5621,"I remember just how she used to look, with her pale cheeks, her deep, soft, serious eyes, her white dress,—she always wore white;"
5622,"Her mouth, half open with astonishment at the wonders of the new Mas’r’s parlor, displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth"
5623,"I get up in the morning, and find one asleep behind the door, and see one black head poking out from under the table, one lying on the door-mat,—and they are mopping and mowing and grinning between all the railings, and tumbling over the kitchen floor!"
5624,"and she approached her new subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black spider, supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it"
5625,“You seem to tink yourself white folks
5626,"You an’t nerry one, black nor white, I’d like to be one or turrer"
5627,I took Miss Eva’s red thing she wars on her neck
5628,"“I took Rosa’s yer-rings,—them red ones"
5629,"Topsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with hands decently folded, now, at a signal from Miss Ophelia, went on:"
5630,"In the market, at morning, his eyes were always on the flower-stalls for rare bouquets for her, and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his pocket to give to her when he came back;"
5631,"The lake lay in rosy or golden streaks, save where white-winged vessels glided hither and thither, like so many spirits, and little golden stars twinkled through the glow, and looked down at themselves as they trembled in the water"
5632,"Augustine, with his blue eyes and golden hair, his ethereally flexible form and vivacious features;"
5633,"and this pony was now brought up to the back verandah by Tom, while a little mulatto boy of about thirteen led along a small black Arabian, which had just been imported, at a great expense, for Henrique"
5634,"He had white blood in his veins, as could be seen by the quick flush in his cheek, and the sparkle of his eye, as he eagerly tried to speak"
5635,"“That’s one of your red republican humbugs, Augustine!"
5636,"In August , as a consequence of the French Revolution, the black slaves and mulattoes on Haiti rose in revolt against the whites, and in the period of turmoil that followed enormous cruelties were practised by both sides"
5637,"Sons of white fathers, with all our haughty feelings burning in their veins, will not always be bought and sold and traded"
5638,"She was dressed in a blue riding dress, with a cap of the same color"
5639,"It was late in the afternoon, and the rays of the sun formed a kind of glory behind her, as she came forward in her white dress, with her golden hair and glowing cheeks, her eyes unnaturally bright with the slow fever that burned in her veins"
5640,"“O, Topsy, poor child, I love you!” said Eva, with a sudden burst of feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on Topsy’s shoulder;"
5641,"The round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with tears;—large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on the little white hand"
5642,"The windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white muslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in Paris, to a pattern of his own device, having round it a border of rose-buds and leaves, and a centre-piece with full-flown roses"
5643,"A light, fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room, where a Parian vase, wrought in the shape of a white lily, with its buds, stood, ever filled with flowers"
5644,"It was rather a singular one,—a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one single white japonica, with its glossy leaves"
5645,Eva’s clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other
5646,"and when the fresh sea-breezes blew from the lake,—and the child felt freshest in the morning,—he would sometimes walk with her under the orange-trees in the garden, or, sitting down in some of their old seats, sing to her their favorite old hymns"
5647,"The large blue eyes unclosed—a smile passed over her face;—she tried to raise her head, and to speak"
5648,"O, woe for them who watched thy entrance into heaven, when they shall wake and find only the cold gray sky of daily life, and thou gone forever!”"
5649,"The statuettes and pictures in Eva’s room were shrouded in white napkins, and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard there, and the light stole in solemnly through windows partially darkened by closed blinds"
5650,"There she lay, robed in one of the simple white dresses she had been wont to wear when living;"
5651,"Eva’s little table, covered with white, bore on it her favorite vase, with a single white moss rose-bud in it"
5652,"Clare stood there thinking, little Rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a basket of white flowers"
5653,"and there were white scarfs and ribbons, and crape bands, and mourners dressed in black crape;"
5654,"Clare leaned his head on his shoulder, and wrung the hard, faithful, black hand"
5655,"the little book had been rolled in a long strip of black crape, torn from the funeral weeds"
5656,"“There, isn’t that black and white, now, Miss Vermont?” he said, as he handed it to her"
5657,"“Do you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?”"
5658,"After a little, he opened one of the drawers, took out an old music-book whose leaves were yellow with age, and began turning it over"
5659,"and yet they are as white as many a woman, north or south"
5660,"And Tom did pray, with all his mind and strength, for the soul that was passing,—the soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from those large, melancholy blue eyes"
5661,"for, in the gates of eternity, the black hand and the white hold each other with an equal clasp"
5662,"But the funeral passed, with all its pageant of black crape, and prayers, and solemn faces;"
5663,"I’ll teach her, with all her airs, that she’s no better than the raggedest black wench that walks the streets!"
5664,"The hope of liberty, the thought of distant wife and children, rose up before his patient soul, as to the mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the church-spire and loving roofs of his native village, seen over the top of some black wave only for one last farewell"
5665,"She found Marie reclining at length upon a lounge, supporting herself on one elbow by pillows, while Jane, who had been out shopping, was displaying before her certain samples of thin black stuffs"
5666,"dis yer’s one o’ yer white niggers,—kind o’ cream color, ye know, scented!” said he, coming up to Adolph and snuffing"
5667,"“Lor, now, how touchy we is,—we white niggers!"
5668,"She has on her head a high-raised turban, made of a gay red Madras handkerchief, of the first quality, her dress is neatly fitted, and of good material, showing that she has been provided for with a careful hand"
5669,"Now, mind yourself,” he said, with a stamp and a fierce glance of his gray eye, directed at Tom, “I’m your church now!"
5670,Something within the silent black man answered No!
5671,"And you, you old yellow poco moonshine!” he said, giving a shove to the mulatto woman to whom Emmeline was chained, “don’t you carry that sort of face!"
5672,The yellow woman I got took in on
5673,"and sad eyes gazed wearily on the steep red-clay banks, as they glided by in dreary sameness"
5674,"It was a wild, forsaken road, now winding through dreary pine barrens, where the wind whispered mournfully, and now over log causeways, through long cypress swamps, the doleful trees rising out of the slimy, spongy ground, hung with long wreaths of funeral black moss, while ever and anon the loathsome form of the mocassin snake might be seen sliding among broken stumps and shattered branches that lay here and there, rotting in the water"
5675,"“Shut up, you black cuss!” roared Legree;"
5676,"It is a common remark, and one that is thought to militate strongly against the character of the race, that the negro overseer is always more tyrannical and cruel than the white one"
5677,"and Legree encouraged his two black satellites to a kind of coarse familiarity with him,—a familiarity, however, at any moment liable to get one or the other of them into trouble;"
5678,"The silver, fair-browed moon rose in the purple sky, and looked down, calm and silent, as God looks on the scene of misery and oppression,—looked calmly on the lone black man, as he sat, with his arms folded, and his Bible on his knee"
5679,"The first he did know, she was walking by his side, erect and proud, in the dim gray of the dawn"
5680,"Suddenly, the stranger woman whom we have described, and who had, in the course of her work, come near enough to hear Tom’s last words, raised her heavy black eyes, and fixed them, for a second, on him;"
5681,A glance like sheet-lightning suddenly flashed from those black eyes;
5682,The black cuss!” said Legree
5683,"She fixed her black eyes steadily on him, her lips moved slightly, and she said something in French"
5684,ye blasted black beast!
5685,"Didn’t I pay down twelve hundred dollars, cash, for all there is inside yer old cussed black shell?"
5686,"Her bonnet fell back, and long wavy streams of black hair fell around her singular and melancholy-face"
5687,"not a white person here, who could testify, if you were burned alive,—if you were scalded, cut into inch-pieces, set up for the dogs to tear, or hung up and whipped to death"
5688,she sat with her black eyes intently fixed on the floor
5689,"and there I used to play hide-and-go-seek, under the orange-trees, with my brothers and sisters"
5690,"He had the yellow fever, and for twenty days and nights I watched with him"
5691,An old black woman tended me;
5692,"So vehement and overpowering was the force with which she spoke, that, for a season, Tom was beguiled even from the pain of his wounds, and, raising himself on one elbow, watched her as she paced restlessly up and down, her long black hair swaying heavily about her, as she moved"
5693,"they keep pushing me on and on—and I’ll do it, too, some of these days!” she said, clenching her hand, while an insane light glanced in her heavy black eyes"
5694,"He had it tied round his neck, with a black string"
5695,"he even thought he saw something white rising and glimmering in the gloom before him, and shuddered to think what if the form of his dead mother should suddenly appear to him"
5696,"She rested her small, slender hand on the window-blind, and looked fixedly at them;—there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce bitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so"
5697,"There’s a place way out down by the quarters, where you can see a black, blasted tree, and the ground all covered with black ashes"
5698,"and his heart throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire, as he thought that the wondrous all, of which he had often pondered,—the great white throne, with its ever radiant rainbow;"
5699,"the white-robed multitude, with voices as many waters;"
5700,"ETERNITY,—the word thrilled through the black man’s soul with light and power, as he spoke;"
5701,"I’ll score it against ye, and sometime I’ll have my pay out o’ yer old black hide,—mind ye!”"
5702,"Imagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap shades waves of silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which overarches thoughtful gray eyes"
5703,"her glossy brown silk dress rustles peacefully, as she glides up and down the chamber"
5704,"“Now for it,” said she, as she stood before the glass, and shook down her silky abundance of black curly hair"
5705,"“You would scarcely know the woman from a white one,” said Marks"
5706,"The blue waves of Lake Erie danced, rippling and sparkling, in the sun-light"
5707,"When the dim gray of dawn woke the slumberers to go forth to the field, there was among those tattered and shivering wretches one who walked with an exultant tread;"
5708,"Shut yer old black gash, and get along in with you!”"
5709,"Tom remarked, as the light of the moon fell upon Cassy’s large, black eyes, that there was a wild and peculiar glare in them, unlike their wonted fixed despair"
5710,"“Come!” said she, in a whisper, fixing her black eyes on him"
5711,"When we can love and pray over all and through all, the battle’s past, and the victory’s come,—glory be to God!” And, with streaming eyes and choking voice, the black man looked up to heaven"
5712,"Cassy raised her sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of Legree, with an expression that went through his bones, as she said, “To be sure, Simon, who are they?"
5713,his face grew white with fear
5714,"Cassy sat down by her, put her arm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair;"
5715,"and I’ll have it out of his old black hide, or I’ll know the reason why!”"
5716,"“Do you dare to tell me, ye old black Christian, ye don’t know?” said Legree"
5717,There was not a white person on the place;
5718,"They banked it up, and laid green turf over it"
5719,"and, therefore, there were abundance of full-length portraits of the ghost, abundantly sworn and testified to, which, as is often the case with portraits, agreed with each other in no particular, except the common family peculiarity of the ghost tribe,—the wearing of a white sheet"
5720,"Be it as it may, we have private reasons for knowing that a tall figure in a white sheet did walk, at the most approved ghostly hours, around the Legree premises,—pass out the doors, glide about the house,—disappear at intervals, and, reappearing, pass up the silent stairway, into that fatal garret;"
5721,"By a singular coincidence, on the very night that this vision appeared to Legree, the house-door was found open in the morning, and some of the negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards the high-road"
5722,"A small black bonnet on her head, covered by a veil thick with embroidery, concealed her face"
5723,"At this point in the story, she touched his arm, and, with a face perfectly white with interest, said, “Do you know the names of the people he bought her of?”"
5724,"In one corner of the room was a table covered with a green cloth, where was an open writing-desk, pens, paper, and over it a shelf of well-selected books"
5725,"Arrayed in a new calico dress, with clean, white apron, and high, well-starched turban, her black polished face glowing with satisfaction, she lingered, with needless punctiliousness, around the arrangements of the table, merely as an excuse for talking a little to her mistress"
5726,"Don’t see, for my part, how white people gen’lly can bar to hev to write things much as they do, writin’ ’s such slow, oneasy kind o’ work"
5727,"“O, poor Aunt Chloe!” said George, stopping compassionately, and taking her hard, black hand between both his;"
5728,"An aged, partriarchal negro, who had grown gray and blind on the estate, now rose, and, lifting his trembling hand said, “Let us give thanks unto the Lord!” As all kneeled by one consent, a more touching and hearty Te Deum never ascended to heaven, though borne on the peal of organ, bell and cannon, than came from that honest old heart"
5729,white-washer;
5730,"There stood one, in physical proportion and stature commanding and exact—in intellect richly endowed—in natural eloquence a prodigy—in soul manifestly “created but a little lower than the angels”—yet a slave, ay, a fugitive slave,—trembling for his safety, hardly daring to believe that on the American soil, a single white person could be found who would befriend him at all hazards, for the love of God and humanity!"
5731,"To illustrate the effect of slavery on the white man,—to show that he has no powers of endurance, in such a condition, superior to those of his black brother,—Daniel O’Connell, the distinguished advocate of universal emancipation, and the mightiest champion of prostrate but not conquered Ireland, relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered by him in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the Loyal National Repeal Association, March ,"
5732,"So much for the humanizing influence of The Domestic Institution!” Admitting this to have been an extraordinary case of mental deterioration, it proves at least that the white slave can sink as low in the scale of humanity as the black one"
5733,"but I think the most thrilling one of them all is the description Douglass gives of his feelings, as he stood soliloquizing respecting his fate, and the chances of his one day being a freeman, on the banks of the Chesapeake Bay—viewing the receding vessels as they flew with their white wings before the breeze, and apostrophizing them as animated by the living spirit of freedom"
5734,"By the slave code, they are adjudged to be as incompetent to testify against a white man, as though they were indeed a part of the brute creation"
5735,The white children could tell their ages
5736,My father was a white man
5737,"she is never better pleased than when she sees them under the lash, especially when she suspects her husband of showing to his mulatto children favors which he withholds from his black slaves"
5738,"The master is frequently compelled to sell this class of his slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife;"
5739,"for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them himself, but must stand by and see one white son tie up his brother, of but few shades darker complexion than himself, and ply the gory lash to his naked back;"
5740,"for thousands are ushered into the world, annually, who, like myself, owe their existence to white fathers, and those fathers most frequently their own masters"
5741,"She was a woman of noble form, and of graceful proportions, having very few equals, and fewer superiors, in personal appearance, among the colored or white women of our neighborhood"
5742,"He then said to her, “Now, you d——d b—-h, I’ll learn you how to disobey my orders!” and after rolling up his sleeves, he commenced to lay on the heavy cowskin, and soon the warm, red blood (amid heart-rending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping to the floor"
5743,"It abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south"
5744,"It was a common saying, even among little white boys, that it was worth a half-cent to kill a “nigger,” and a half-cent to bury one"
5745,it was a white face beaming with the most kindly emotions;
5746,She was entirely unlike any other white woman I had ever seen
5747,I could not approach her as I was accustomed to approach other white ladies
5748,"That cheerful eye, under the influence of slavery, soon became red with rage;"
5749,"I now understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty—to wit, the white man’s power to enslave the black man"
5750,"The girls seldom passed her without her saying, “Move faster, you black gip!” at the same time giving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders, often drawing the blood"
5751,"She would then say, “Take that, you black gip!” continuing, “If you don’t move faster, I’ll move you!” Added to the cruel lashings to which these slaves were subjected, they were kept nearly half-starved"
5752,"The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was that of making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street"
5753,for I was much better off in this regard than many of the poor white children in our neighborhood
5754,"A single word from the white men was enough—against all our wishes, prayers, and entreaties—to sunder forever the dearest friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings"
5755,"Michael’s, there was a white young man, a Mr. Wilson, who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the instruction of such slaves as might be disposed to learn to read the New Testament"
5756,"I have seen him tie up a lame young woman, and whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders, causing the warm red blood to drip;"
5757,"Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay, whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe"
5758,"but that before I went, I must go with him into another part of the woods, where there was a certain root, which, if I would take some of it with me, carrying it always on my right side, would render it impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to whip me"
5759,"I did not hesitate to let it be known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must also succeed in killing me"
5760,"It was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why Mr. Covey did not immediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping-post, and there regularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a white man in defence of myself"
5761,Does he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a white person?
5762,"Any one having a white face, and being so disposed, could stop us, and subject us to examination"
5763,"Just as I got to the house, in looking out at the lane gate, I saw four white men, with two colored men"
5764,"The white men were on horseback, and the colored ones were walking behind, as if tied"
5765,You yellow devil!
5766,"and I might have remained there longer, but for a most horrid fight I had with four of the white apprentices, in which my left eye was nearly knocked out, and I was horribly mangled in other respects"
5767,"Until a very little while after I went there, white and black ship-carpenters worked side by side, and no one seemed to see any impropriety in it"
5768,Many of the black carpenters were freemen
5769,"All at once, the white carpenters knocked off, and said they would not work with free colored workmen"
5770,"Their reason for this, as alleged, was, that if free colored carpenters were encouraged, they would soon take the trade into their own hands, and poor white men would be thrown out of employment"
5771,"And, taking advantage of Mr. Gardner’s necessities, they broke off, swearing they would work no longer, unless he would discharge his black carpenters"
5772,"All this took place in sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not one interposed a friendly word;"
5773,He struck a white person
5774,"for to strike a white man is death by Lynch law,—and that was the law in Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard;"
5775,"” His answer was, he could do nothing in the case, unless some white man would come forward and testify"
5776,"Of course, it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer his testimony in my behalf, and against the white young men"
5777,"The motto which I adopted when I started from slavery was this—“Trust no man!” I saw in every white man an enemy, and in almost every colored man cause for distrust"
5778,"but such was the strength of prejudice against color, among the white calkers, that they refused to work with me, and of course I could get no employment"
5779,"The truth was, I felt myself a slave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down"
5780,"“They’ll bleat and baa, dona like goats, Gorge down black sheep, and strain at motes, Array their backs in fine black coats, Then seize their negroes by their throats, And choke, for heavenly union"
5781,"One day Cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which they called a park, saw between the bushes, Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson in experimental natural philosophy to her mother's chamber-maid, a little brown wench, very pretty and very docile"
5782,Two men dressed in blue observed him
5783,"""Master Pangloss has well said that all is for the best in this world, for I am infinitely more touched by your extreme generosity than with the inhumanity of that gentleman in the black coat and his lady"
5784,"on the other hand, I must own he had a good shape, and a soft and white skin;"
5785,"""I had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids;"
5786,what black eyebrows!
5787,"""With difficulty I disengaged myself from such a heap of slaughtered bodies, and crawled to a large orange tree on the bank of a neighbouring rivulet, where I fell, oppressed with fright, fatigue, horror, despair, and hunger"
5788,"I opened my eyes, and saw a white man, of good countenance, who sighed, and who said between his teeth:"

5790,"Candide was at once conducted to a beautiful summer-house, ornamented with a very pretty colonnade of green and gold marble, and with trellises, enclosing parraquets, humming-birds, fly-birds, guinea-hens, and all other rare birds"
5791,"He was a very handsome young man, with a full face, white skin but high in colour;"
5792,"he had an arched eyebrow, a lively eye, red ears, vermilion lips, a bold air, but such a boldness as neither belonged to a Spaniard nor a Jesuit"
5793,"The roads were covered, or rather adorned, with carriages of a glittering form and substance, in which were men and women of surprising beauty, drawn by large red sheep which surpassed in fleetness the finest coursers of Andalusia, Tetuan, and Mequinez"
5794,"""I cannot conceive,"" said he, ""what pleasure you Europeans find in our yellow clay, but take as much as you like, and great good may it do you"
5795,"There were two great red sheep saddled and bridled to ride upon as soon as they were beyond the mountains, twenty pack-sheep laden with provisions, thirty with presents of the curiosities of the country, and fifty with gold, diamonds, and precious stones"
5796,"As they drew near the town, they saw a negro stretched upon the ground, with only one moiety of his clothes, that is, of his blue linen drawers;"
5797,"Besides, Candide was possessed of money and jewels, and though he had lost one hundred large red sheep, laden with the greatest treasure upon earth;"
5798,"The Abbé listened attentively, and seemed to be in a brown study"
5799,"so that, perhaps, as I have found my red sheep and Paquette, it may well be that I shall also find Cunegonde"
5800,"One evening that Candide and Martin were going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn, a man whose complexion was as black as soot, came behind Candide, and taking him by the arm, said:"
5801,"The tender, loving Candide, seeing his beautiful Cunegonde embrowned, with blood-shot eyes, withered neck, wrinkled cheeks, and rough, red arms, recoiled three paces, seized with horror, and then advanced out of good manners"

5807,"He followed him, and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords"
5808,"He was seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down, supporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment of silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points"
5809,"As he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak"
5810,"In this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated chairs"

5812,"Mademoiselle Baptistine’s ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a rose pattern, and with mahogany in swan’s neck style, with a sofa"

5814,"All the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals"
5815,"The chambers were paved in red bricks, which were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds"
5816,"Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted the white wall which enclosed it"

5821,Their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite
5822,"His fresh and ruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved, and which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man, “He’s a good fellow”;"
5823,"his broad and serious brow, rendered august by his white locks, became august also by virtue of meditation;"
5824,"His shirt of coarse yellow linen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view of his hairy breast:"
5825,"trousers of blue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the other;"
5826,"an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine;"
5827,"A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks, was turning on a long spit before the fire;"
5828,"On the white margin he wrote a line or two, folded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey"
5829,a pine branch suspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight
5830,"A copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter jug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking soup-tureen"
5831,"He wore a huge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a hammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out"
5832,"his shirt, widely opened and turned back, displayed his bull neck, white and bare"
5833,"He had thick eyelashes, enormous black whiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of his face like a snout;"
5834,"Madame Magloire wore a white quilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck, the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with large, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks, knotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her feet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles"
5835,She concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig
5836,"This evening, when I arrived in these parts, I went to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport, which I had shown at the town-hall"
5837,"” He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper, which he unfolded"
5838,"“Madame Magloire,” said the Bishop, “you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove"
5839,"“Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat, cold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing, the cell for one word;"
5840,Now there is the yellow passport
5841,There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men
5842,A fresh white bed had been prepared there
5843,"As for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets"
5844,At Toulon he was clothed in the red cassock
5845,He very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided
5846,"On the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of an orange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales"
5847,It was necessary to show him the yellow passport
5848,"The garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall, easy to climb"
5849,"He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, on account of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool, which covered his arms to the wrists"
5850,"That moon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver, that house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man, and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was confidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant"
5851,"I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God"
5852,"“My piece of money!” cried the child, “my white piece!"
5853,"His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass"
5854,"Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight"
5855,"On emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop had hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark"
5856,"It was the candid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in the church-warden’s pew of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, in his costume of a peer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty of profile peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action"
5857,"and since England refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned"
5858,"Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in footed trousers, and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his gray hair, with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist’s instruments spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which were charming, while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter to M"
5859,"Favourite, Blachevelle’s friend, the one aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front under the great green boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, and presided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun"
5860,"She preferred to carry her little hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, in her hand rather than on her head"
5861,"She wore a gown of mauve barège, little reddish brown buskins, whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-worked stockings, and that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention, whose name, canezou, a corruption of the words quinze août, pronounced after the fashion of the Canebière, signifies fine weather, heat, and midday"
5862,"Brilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavy lids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, a white skin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to be seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust throat of the Juno of Ægina, a strong and supple nape of the neck, shoulders modelled as though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in the middle, visible through the muslin;"
5863,"It was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem, whose numerous branches, bristling and leafless and as fine as threads, were covered with a million tiny white rosettes;"
5864,"the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting sun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries"
5865,"Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the white-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from button-holes in the year"
5866,"But, my dear, you are splitting my head!’ So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as he can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know what?"
5867,there are hardly any green peas in the market;
5868,"one day when Blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Guérin-Boisseau, he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, which displayed her legs"
5869,"O nibbling sex, your pretty little white teeth adore sugar"
5870,"a soul of a rosy and purple hue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn"
5871,"From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow and black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless by trunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediately disappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge, with dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements, changing all the paving-stones into steels"
5872,red spots represented blood;
5873,"Above and around these two delicate heads, all made of happiness and steeped in light, the gigantic fore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, all entangled in curves and wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern"
5874,"A large blue handkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a fichu, and concealed her figure clumsily"
5875,"she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown, and coarse shoes"
5876,"The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother’s, and looked at—what?"
5877,"It was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six years old, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes, sweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands, and a tear in her great eyes"
5878,had had for its special industry the imitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany
5879,"Spain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchases there each year"
5880,"He had gray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, the thoughtful visage of a philosopher"

5882,"In addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth"
5883,"The public writer, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the wine-shop"
5884,"In her youth, in ’, she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from the Bernardines to the Jacobins"
5885,"A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips, and she had a black hole in her mouth"
5886,"At that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big cravat, a watch with trinkets, three vests of different colors, worn one on top of the other—the red and blue inside;"
5887,"she placed Javert’s coarse hand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him"
5888,"Madeleine uttered that word, I, as we have just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the mayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence, and say to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:—"
5889,"Carve as we will the mysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it"
5890,My little white horse—you may have seen him pass occasionally;
5891,"while, if he accomplished his sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys, the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil, and pitiless shame"
5892,"This poor little Cosette who has no one in the world but me, and who is, no doubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den of those Thénardiers;"
5893,"in this hiding-place there were some rags—a blue linen blouse, an old pair of trousers, an old knapsack, and a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends"
5894,"and, during this time, while you are here in the midst of joy and light, there will be a man who will wear your red blouse, who will bear your name in ignominy, and who will drag your chain in the galleys"
5895,never more should he write on that little table of white wood;
5896,"instead of that, the convict gang, the iron necklet, the red waistcoat, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell, the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well!"
5897,"and at night, dripping with perspiration, overwhelmed with lassitude, their green caps drawn over their eyes, to remount, two by two, the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant’s whip"
5898,It was still black night
5899,"Below him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness"
5900,It was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse
5901,"by the Hesdin road, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the town, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going in the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a man enveloped in a mantle"
5902,"but without his being aware of it, and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul"
5903,"He paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horse put to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning"
5904,"The servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the mayor had set out that morning before six o’clock, in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, cold as the weather was;"
5905,"Then she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face became ineffable;"
5906,"the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable;"
5907,"Besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry, there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of M"
5908,"A few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted cabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon a table with a green cloth"
5909,"He approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and which contained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas Pache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, no doubt, the th of June, of the year II"
5910,"ancient, spotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that was yellow rather than green;"
5911,The ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central prisons
5912,"Chenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by his red cassock and his green cap"
5913,"his hair, which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, was now entirely white:"
5914,it had turned white during the hour he had sat there
5915,"“Cochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stamped in blue letters with burnt powder;"
5916,Your hair is perfectly white!”
5917,"only now, after the lapse of two months, her hair was gray and his was white"
5918,"All night long I have seen white things, and persons who smiled at me"
5919,And did she have white linen?
5920,"In five years she will have a white veil, and openwork stockings;"
5921,"He was cool, calm, grave, his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation"
5922,"and while he was wrapping up the Bishop’s candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread"
5923,"The clump of sparsely planted but very green trees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is dispersed over the meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and as in order in the direction of Braine-l’Alleud"
5924,"On the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart at the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried brushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions"
5925,"A young girl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably of some outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in the wind"
5926,"These consisted of large slabs of blue stone, which form a heap among the nettles"
5927,This well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the table for all wells in Belgium
5928,A woman with gray hair said to us:
5929,"That calm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school of Brienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star of the Legion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the white horse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners crowned N’s and eagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings, silver spurs, the sword of Marengo,—that whole figure of the last of the Cæsars is present to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations by some, severely regarded by others"
5930,"We perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy mirage, paraphernalia of war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks, floating sabre-taches, cross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades, hussar dolmans, red boots with a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos garlanded with torsades, the almost black infantry of Brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry of England, the English soldiers with great, white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets, the Hanoverian light-horse with their oblong casques of leather, with brass hands and red horse-tails, the Scotch with their bare knees and plaids, the great white gaiters of our grenadiers;"
5931,"During the mysterious trip from the island of Elba to France, on the th of February, on the open sea, the French brig of war, Le Zéphyr, having encountered the brig L’Inconstant, on which Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the news of Napoleon from L’Inconstant, the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white and amaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of Elba, laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself, “The Emperor is well"
5932,that black Prussian hussar stopped by runners of the flying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between Wavre and Plancenoit;
5933,"then, all at once, a long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appeared above the crest, and casques, trumpets, and standards, and three thousand heads with gray moustaches, shouting, “Vive l’Empereur!” All this cavalry debouched on the plateau, and it was like the appearance of an earthquake"
5934,"Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the little white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles highway, he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle, to the guide Lacoste"
5935,"but Wellington shouted, “Up, Guards, and aim straight!” The red regiment of English guards, lying flat behind the hedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot riddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles;"
5936,"These combatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of spectres, silhouettes of men on horseback, the black profiles of cannon, the white sky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages, the colossal death’s-head, which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke, in the depths of the battle, advanced upon them and gazed at them"
5937,"a vast volume of smoke, vaguely white in the light of the rising moon, rolled out, and when the smoke dispersed, there was no longer anything there"
5938,Europe adopted the white cockade
5939,"Where there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red house"
5940,What matters it if the earth be red!
5941,"Madeleine, had, thanks to the new methods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry, the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets"
5942,"Goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest, a black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden shoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the fact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his head"
5943,"Then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he appears black because it is nightfall;"
5944,"then to run with great speed to the trench, to open it once more and to seize the “treasure” which the black man has necessarily placed there"
5945,"Finally, the last method is not to speak to the black man, not to look at him, and to flee at the best speed of one’s legs"
5946,"So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quite frequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the black man, and tried to rob the devil"
5947,"beside the son of France as generalissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards Charles Albert, enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a volunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted;"
5948,"the soldiers of the Empire setting out on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eight years of repose, and under the white cockade;"
5949,"the tricolored standard waved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standard had been thirty years earlier at Coblentz;"
5951,"On arriving on a level with the top, a gust of wind carried away his cap, and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen:"
5952,In there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so many well-satisfied citizens:
5953,"Some pleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be sure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in twisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters;"
5954,"Her big face, dotted with red blotches, presented the appearance of a skimmer"
5955,"He wore a blouse, and under his blouse an old black coat"
5956,It seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must be an object coveted by all
5957,"Her eye was black in consequence of a blow from Madame Thénardier’s fist, which caused the latter to remark from time to time, “How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!”"
5958,"From time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, and exclaimed, “It’s as black as an oven!” or, “One must needs be a cat to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour!” And Cosette trembled"
5959,"In the first row, and far forwards, the merchant had placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll, nearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with gold wheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes"
5960,"She gazed at that beautiful pink dress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, “How happy that doll must be!” She could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall"
5961,"Overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were like masses of smoke"
5962,One inhales the effluvia of the great black void
5963,"Without understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she was seized upon by that black enormity of nature;"
5964,"A large black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through the darkness;"
5965,"black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted;"
5966,"He would have been taken for more than sixty years of age, from his perfectly white hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and his countenance, where everything breathed depression and weariness of life"
5967,"the most had been made of its knots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from red wax:"
5968,"In the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered à l’oiseau royal, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the Golden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of Honor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide blue ribbon:"
5969,"Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English gaiters;"
5970,"The promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter, and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant as to this detail"
5971,"When the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track, he redoubled his pace, not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed"
5972,"Her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried, which marked the places where the Thénardier woman had touched her"
5973,The man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette
5974,"In the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements"
5975,"the one with shining chestnut tresses, the other with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious, neat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye"
5976,"The man looked at Cosette’s poor little red feet, and continued:—"
5977,“Who can this yellow man be?”
5978,"They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Éponine, who was the elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and its contortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps"
5979,Madame Thénardier approached the yellow man;
5980,"On being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, “the millionaire,” consented at last to take supper"
5981,"That pink and shining foot, projecting from the shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who said to Éponine, “Look!"
5982,” A czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial son’s blue ribbon would wear no other face
5983,It was an odd moment when Cosette’s rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll
5984,"the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, and Thénardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was of rare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead, curtained with red calico"
5985,"On the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman’s head-dress in silver wire and orange flowers"
5986,"When he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on “his spouse,” and would result in what the English call respectability for his house"
5987,"At the further extremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds"
5988,"On the following morning, two hours at least before day-break, Thénardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, pen in hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat"
5989,The yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand
5990,The landlady’s red and violent face brightened up hideously
5991,"Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in the yellow great-coat had escaped him"
5992,"The stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the table"
5993,"Daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms, pass along the road to Paris"
5994,"then a long, low, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in mourning, laden with mosses, which were covered with flowers in the spring;"
5995,"almost directly facing it opens the Rue de la Barrière des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved, planted with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to the season, and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris"
5996,"everywhere about stood hovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white walls like winding-sheets;"
5997,"The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades, like morsels of the infinite"
5998,It was the second white apparition which he had encountered
5999,"It sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all cracked with chilblains, and kissed it"
6000,At times she became serious and stared at her little black gown
6001,"He still wore his yellow coat, his black breeches, and his old hat"
6002,"All were tall, dressed in long, brown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands"
6003,"The extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,—a lofty white wall"
6004,"At the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, he perceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the lane and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps"
6005,"As we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouette standing on guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the Rue Petit-Picpus, he recoiled"
6006,"He saw that black form standing out in relief against the white pavement, illuminated by the moon;"
6007,Here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss
6008,"The grass had half taken possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest"
6009,"One of those façades cast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like an immense black pall"
6010,he beheld a blue sky
6011,"The two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese, black bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man was saying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter’s knee:"
6012,"He wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth many millions, being all wadded with bank-bills"
6013,"“Yesterday, an aged grandfather, with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do gentleman, who was walking with his grandchild, aged eight, was arrested and conducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an escaped convict!”"
6014,"which it was necessary to know,—if, the porter once passed, one entered a little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at a time, if one did not allow one’s self to be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, if one ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second, and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and the chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency"
6015,"If one opened it, one found one’s self in a little chamber about six feet square, tiled, well-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hung with nankin paper with green flowers, at fifteen sous the roll"
6016,"The little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars, without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact"
6017,"a regular box, with its front just of a height to lean upon, bearing a tablet of black wood"
6018,"There he encountered a barrier of black shutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread yellow"
6019,the rest was covered with a black veil
6020,"One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form that was barely defined, covered with a black shroud"
6021,"All is black except the band, which is white"
6022,"The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the black guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève wore a white one, and had, besides, on their breasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt or gilded copper"
6023,"On the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in her handsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her hair is brushed until it shines, and curled"
6024,"a great black veil is thrown over her, and the office for the dead is sung"
6025,"” They were dressed in blue, with a white cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast"
6026,In the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their black garments
6027,"Radiant faces, white foreheads, innocent eyes, full of merry light, all sorts of auroras, were scattered about amid these shadows"
6028,pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners;
6029,"and there was in that black garden, youth, health, noise, cries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses, those of the epic as well as those of the fairy-tale, those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage from Hecuba to la Mère-Grand"
6030,"It was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six years of age improvised the following tale, which was listened to by blue eyes aged four and five years:—"
6031,"Above the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called the white Paternoster, and which possessed the property of bearing people straight to paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:—"
6032,"“Little white Paternoster, which God made, which God said, which God placed in paradise"
6033,"where is he?’ ‘He is on the tree of the Cross, his feet hanging, his hands nailed, a little cap of white thorns on his head"
6034,"In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly"
6035,"This woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion and tolerably pretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes"
6036,"He had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be very coquettish, that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head, and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world"
6037,"One even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating, and to wave her white handkerchief"
6038,"a reunion of all the black, gray, and white medleys of all communities and all possible varieties;"
6039,"This holy woman, too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her death"
6040,"A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted in the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her silverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with her own hand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion, possessed the property of frightening away robbers:—"
6041,"To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard, all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison walls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the Rue Polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago"
6042,"At the convent of the Rue du Temple, in particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, a portrait of a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, and even the head of a Turk"
6043,"The Catholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the black radiance of death"
6044,there immense white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark;
6045,"They rubbed a black heifer over with chalk, and said, “She is white, Bos cretatus"
6046,"All undergo the same tonsure, wear the same frock, eat the same black bread, sleep on the same straw, die on the same ashes"
6047,"“The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth"
6048,"“In the first place, it will be a white cloth"
6049,"“Let it be a white cloth, then"
6050,"This hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms"
6051,"A mourning-coach, in which could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his red cap, followed"
6052,Two undertaker’s men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse
6053,The sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery
6054,He is a jug of red wine
6055,there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket
6056,"He thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the grave-digger, who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth, observing it, and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it"
6057,they were clothed in frightful red blouses;
6058,"they were attired, not in a red blouse, but in a black shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in summer and thin in winter, without the power to add or subtract anything from it;"
6059,"He is from seven to thirteen years of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the open air, wears an old pair of trousers of his father’s, which descend below his heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below his ears, a single suspender of yellow listing;"
6060,"the lady-bird, the death’s-head plant-louse, the daddy-long-legs, “the devil,” a black insect, which menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns"
6061,"He has his fabulous monster, which has scales under its belly, but is not a lizard, which has pustules on its back, but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns and wells that have run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which crawls sometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but which has a look, and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it;"
6062,“He is talking to his black cap!
6063,"The wine on Surêne is a parody of the wine of Alba, the red border of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of Balatro, Père-Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains the same gleams as the Esquiliæ, and the grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainly the equivalent of the slave’s hived coffin"
6064,"Geniuses flash forth there, the red tails prosper there"
6065,"Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, think aloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize with the public place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly, proclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear green boughs from the oaks"
6066,The dancers at the opera are pink female savages
6067,"“What a charming grand seigneur,” he said, “and what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon!”"
6068,"“The elixir of gold,” he exclaimed, “the yellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte’s drops, in the eighteenth century,—this was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love, the panacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial"
6069,"If any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the Republic in his presence, he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of swooning"
6070,"Luc-Esprit Gillenormand, who had not lost his hair,—which was gray rather than white,—and which was always dressed in “dog’s ears"
6071,"She belonged to the society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals, mumbled special orisons, revered “the holy blood,” venerated “the sacred heart,” remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful, and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble, and through great rays of gilded wood"
6072,", who, during his lifetime, had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions, had died bankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as his entire fortune, some very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub, in ten manuscript volumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges"
6073,"They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitution of the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII"
6074,"Any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at this epoch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous iron cable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over the parapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned by the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent, prematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand, in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces, charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were they much larger:"
6075,"” He had only an old blue coat, and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion of Honor"
6076,He passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz
6077,"These antique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child’s mind with the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when they were all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their gray or white hair, their long gowns of another age, whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, words which were both majestic and severe, little Marius stared at them with frightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, but patriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms"
6078,"the Marquis de Sass****, private secretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published, under the pseudonym of Charles-Antoine, monorhymed odes, the Prince de Beauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C***** d’E******, the man in all France who best understood “proportioned politeness,” the Comte d’Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Chévalier de Port-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King’s cabinet, M"
6079,"they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at night"
6080,"The Cardinal of Cl****** T******* was a merry little man, who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked-up cassock;"
6081,"through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French Academy then held its meetings, the curious could, on every Tuesday, contemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standing erect, freshly powdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to the door, apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar"
6082,There lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society
6083,"They indulged, and usefully too, in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats"
6084,"Marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on that venerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, on those white locks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brown lines, marking sword-thrusts, and a sort of red stars, which indicated bullet-holes, were visible"
6085,"I am thy son!” How he would have embraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon his scar, pressed his hands, adored his garment, kissed his feet!"
6086,"They thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast, under his shirt, which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon"
6087,"At that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial, made its appearance at the window of the coupé"
6088,"At the extremity of the grave, on a little swelling which marked the head, there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters:"
6089,"Marius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of the morning, descended at his grandfather’s door, and, wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly to his chamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat, and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to the bath"
6090,"The bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but not defiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon"
6091,"In fact, a case of black shagreen, resembling a medallion portrait, was suspended from the ribbon"
6092,"At the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, fell from one of the pockets of the great-coat"
6093,Mademoiselle Gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper
6094,"They were all rascals, assassins, red-caps, thieves!"
6095,"While carrying Marius’ “duds” precipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather’s command, Nicolette had, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic staircase, which was dark, that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel"
6096,"If any grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais, seeing that face of a youth escaped from college, that page’s mien, those long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in the wind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora, and had tried her beauty on Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss, and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais"
6097,and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky
6098,"he knew that the best coffee was to be had at the Café Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Café Voltaire, that good cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard du Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget’s, excellent matelotes at the Barrière de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine at the Barrière du Compat"
6099,The bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff:
6100,"Death to Blondeau!’ At that moment, Blondeau dipped his pen in, all black with erasures in the ink, cast his yellow eyes round the audience room, and repeated for the third time:"
6101,"“The gray hue of a reassured rat,” said Courfeyrac"
6102,White on white is ferocious;
6103,"I add, as the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of roses and blue spectacles"
6104,"my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, with tiny feet, little hands, she dresses well, and is white and dimpled, with the eyes of a fortune-teller"
6105,"Enjolras, whose blue eye was not fixed on any one, and who seemed to be gazing at space, replied, without glancing at Marius:—"
6106,"From that time forth, he had not put off his black garments"
6107,"but, this child once gone, he felt a black void in his heart;"
6108,Marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form;
6109,"The first young lad who comes to hand, however poor he may be, with his strength, his health, his rapid walk, his brilliant eyes, his warmly circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips, his white teeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor"
6110,"He had a passable stomach, a brother who was a curé, perfectly white hair, no teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a trembling in every limb, a Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of an old sheep, and he was easily frightened"
6111,"One day I saw the Senators cross the Quai Malplaquet in mantles of violet velvet sown with bees, with hats à la Henri IV"
6112,"Marius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature, with thick and intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow, well-opened and passionate nostrils, an air of calmness and sincerity, and with something indescribably proud, thoughtful, and innocent over his whole countenance"
6113,"He wore blue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed hat, which always appeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, that is to say, it was dazzlingly white, but of coarse linen"
6114,it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino
6115,"It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees"
6116,"” She had wonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that seemed made of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale flush, an agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted like sunbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have given to Mary, set upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to a Venus"
6117,"This did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those drooping eyes"
6118,"And then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, her merino gown, her scholar’s shoes, and red hands;"
6119,"She wore a dress of black damask, a cape of the same material, and a bonnet of white crape"
6120,"Her white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the carved, Chinese ivory handle of a parasol, and her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot"
6121,"That evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes over his garments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been so slovenly, indecorous, and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in the Luxembourg with his “every-day clothes,” that is to say, with a hat battered near the band, coarse carter’s boots, black trousers which showed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the elbows"
6122,"then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould, and one of whose hips was missing"
6123,It seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague blue light
6124,"he halted near the middle of the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down, and reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit, that after all, it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat"
6125,"He seated himself there, as on the preceding day, surveying from a distance, and clearly making out, the white bonnet, the black dress, and above all, that blue light"
6126,” Still the white-haired man and the girl advanced
6127,"While conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man, she bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye"
6128,the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure
6129,"pattern, bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the soldier’s cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a coat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a wooden leg"
6130,he contented himself with going at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows
6131,The social order has its black miners
6132,"less than twenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries, charming black hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes;"
6133,They had twelve black hours before them;
6134,"Fatigued by the wild nights which they passed, they went off by day to sleep, sometimes in the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned quarries of Montmatre or Montrouge, sometimes in the sewers"
6135,He fell into a black melancholy
6136,"He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the Boulevard des Invalides, a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a cap with a long visor, which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair"
6137,"Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair, and scrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation"
6138,"They plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, and there created, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of vague white spot, then disappeared"
6139,"On the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child’s coffin, covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs, and illuminated by a candle"
6140,"Moreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco was the same, and, although an attempt had been made to vary the style, the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt from them than the Spanish captain"
6141,"Her girdle was a string, her head ribbon a string, her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, red hands, a half-open and degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold, base eyes;"
6142,"And before he had time to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper, which lay in the middle of the table:"
6143,"Do you know, at night, when I walk along the boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all black and as big as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the river, I say to myself:"
6144,"its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black under the long-continued pressure of feet"
6145,"It had projections and angles and black holes, the lower sides of roofs, bays, and promontories"
6146,"In a corner near the aperture through which Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in large letters, was the inscription:"
6147,"in the background, Napoleon in a glory, leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription:"
6148,This man had a long gray beard
6149,"He was clad in a woman’s chemise, which allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms, bristling with gray hair, to be seen"
6150,"On her feet, she had large, coarse, men’s shoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even to her red ankles, and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters"
6151,"her delicate face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed beneath a pelisse of black satin"
6152,"Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coat which he wore over his blue coat, and had thrown it over the back of the chair"
6153,He hastily donned the brown great-coat
6154,"he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread, which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant, once more!"
6155,"The snow was still falling, and streaking the gray of the sky"
6156,“Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?”
6157,"“One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven"
6158,"A man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could be distinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along about twenty paces in advance of Marius"
6159,"This man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too large for him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud"
6160,"He halted at an ironmonger’s shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue Pierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the shop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle, which he concealed beneath his great-coat"
6161,"the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect"
6162,“How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!” said she
6163,“To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!” said the father
6164,"a blue flame flickered over it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by Jondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat"
6165,She had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of Charles X
6166,"Now, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the reader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes of the Salpêtrière covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in the moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone redly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows of black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around, the Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and of darkness;"
6167,"This man wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and gaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on his feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his face smeared with black"
6168,Many of the workmen might have black faces
6169,his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect
6170,“Their faces are black because they work in charcoal
6171,"The door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of black paper"
6172,Smoked brown!
6173,It wasn’t you who had a yellow great-coat!
6174,"you folks warm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats, like archbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month of January, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and when you want to know whether it is cold, you look in the papers to see what the engineer Chevalier’s thermometer says about it"
6175,"Thénardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, shoved aside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring pallet, and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars"
6176,"you haven’t imagined that I should take all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair this evening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of these gentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer’s"
6177,"These men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces, and made of them, at fear’s pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, or demons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either wrath or mercy, with a sort of ennui"
6178,"Before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward, he had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to the brazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now Thénardier, the female Thénardier, and the ruffians, huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as almost free and in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red-hot chisel, which emitted a threatening glow"
6179,They also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou
6180,"Marius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly a muscle of the old man’s face contracted, and while the red-hot iron sank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed on Thénardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and where suffering vanished in serene majesty"
6181,"The old woman, choking with indignation, now rose completely upright, and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, all hollowed into angles and wrinkles, with crow’s-feet meeting the corners of her mouth"
6182,"a moment later, the old woman, who had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his clear, young voice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the wintry wind:—"
6183,"he wore no crown, although a king, and no white hair, although an old man;"
6184,"In the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-à-brac, there were seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike lengthwise and in four;"
6185,"these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and a card, on which was written the following:—"
6186,"that is to say, a pole surmounted by a red cap"
6187,"Facing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying, but ferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men, smiling, embroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, in white plumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their elbows on a velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently on demeanor and the preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, of divine right, of fanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the death penalty, of war, glorifying in low tones and with politeness, the sword, the stake, and the scaffold"
6188,I’ll black your boots
6189,The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the vicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind
6190,"There is something indescribable there which exhales grace, a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines, from which flutter rags drying in the wind, and an old market-gardener’s house, built in the time of Louis XIII"
6191,"It had remained fitted with its old furniture, was always for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people who passed through the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since"
6192,"Long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors, like those on the bed, hung at the windows of the first floor"
6193,"Jean Valjean inhabited the sort of porter’s lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard, with a mattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two straw chairs, an earthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his beloved valise in one corner, and never any fire"
6194,"He dined with Cosette, and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use"
6195,"More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient, padlocked gate, twisted, tottering, fastened to two green and moss-covered pillars, and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque"
6196,"In Floréal this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and within its four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered in the rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love, and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in its veins, and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks, sprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced statues, on the crumbling steps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement of the deserted street, flowers like stars, dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy, perfumes"
6197,"At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade"
6198,"Instead of flowers on the branches and dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves;"
6199,"the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the Rue Saint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vain did the yellow, brown, white, and red omnibuses cross each other’s course at the neighboring crossroads;"
6200,"and the death of the former proprietors, the revolution which had passed over it, the crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness, forty years of abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, great crimped plants, with large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles, uneasy and rapid insects;"
6201,"Then, in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread, Jean Valjean ate white bread"
6202,"When he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, and dropped a silent tear, saying to herself:"
6203,"Her figure was formed, her skin had grown white, her hair was lustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes"
6204,"The first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle, and her white crape bonnet, she took Jean Valjean’s arm, gay, radiant, rosy, proud, dazzling"
6205,It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before
6206,"You blush and turn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk?"
6207,"and she remained dejected, absorbed, attentive to but a single thought, her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished"
6208,"On each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect, wearing three-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, shabby, covered with spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers’ men, half gray, half blue, which were almost hanging in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder belts, short sabres, muskets, and cudgels;"
6209,"Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps, and, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the elbow;"
6210,eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen
6211,One of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing;
6212,"here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths, bald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation, savage grins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages, and by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces, to which death alone was lacking"
6213,"A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, on one side"
6214,“The green-grocer insists on being paid
6215,"You will drink water, you will eat black bread, you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long, riveted to your limbs"
6216,"You desire fine black cloth, varnished shoes, to have your hair curled and sweet-smelling oils on your locks, to please low women, to be handsome"
6217,"You will be shaven clean, and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes"
6218,"You will enter young, rosy, fresh, with brilliant eyes, and all your white teeth, and your handsome, youthful hair;"
6219,"you will come out broken, bent, wrinkled, toothless, horrible, with white locks!"
6220,"In this manner he came up to Montparnasse without being seen or heard, gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth, seized the purse, withdrew his hand, and having recourse once more to his crawling, he slipped away like an adder through the shadows"
6221,"Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue eyes, a round face, was vain, insolent and good-looking;"
6222,It was a white envelope
6223,The glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams
6224,"The serene and lofty soul, inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions, dominating the clouds and the shades of this world, its follies, its lies, its hatreds, its vanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue of heaven, and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny, as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake"
6225,"She sat down, and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though she wished to caress and thank it"
6226,His black clothes were hardly discernible
6227,"How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, that the rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills?"
6228,No one will see anything but true blue in it
6229,"Little Gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent admiration of a wax bride, in a low-necked dress, and crowned with orange-flowers, who was revolving in the window, and displaying her smile to passers-by, between two argand lamps;"
6230,"And unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck, he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, where the scarf became a shawl once more"
6231,"And seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, had taken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up his nose with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great Frederick’s snuff on the tip of his thumb, and hurled this indignant apostrophe full in the baker’s face:—"
6232,"“You mean larton brutal black bread!” retorted Gavroche, calmly and coldly disdainful"
6233,white bread larton savonné!
6234,"The baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread he surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche"
6235,"“Well, he is a very green ‘un,” said Gavroche"
6236,"A man had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no other than Montparnasse in disguise, with blue spectacles, but recognizable to Gavroche"
6237,"“The bow-wows!” went on Gavroche, “you’ve got a hide the color of a linseed plaster, and blue specs like a doctor"
6238,"” There was besides, in Montparnasse’s sentence, a literary beauty which was lost upon Gavroche, that is mon dogue, ma dague et ma digue, a slang expression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my knife, and my wife, greatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great century when Molière wrote and Callot drew"
6239,"It was an elephant forty feet high, constructed of timber and masonry, bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house, formerly painted green by some dauber, and now painted black by heaven, the wind, and time"
6240,"Near the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished"
6241,"Above, a long brown beam, whence started at regular distances, massive, arching ribs, represented the vertebral column with its sides, stalactites of plaster depended from them like entrails, and vast spiders’ webs stretching from side to side, formed dirty diaphragms"
6242,"The mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip of gray woollen stuff, very warm and almost new"
6243,"They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white"
6244,"The rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the elephant, and who were the living black spots which we have already mentioned, had been held in awe by the flame of the candle, so long as it had been lighted;"
6245,"He had seen white mice in the course of his life, and he was not afraid of them"
6246,"The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, after passing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the porte-cochère of the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs in wooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads out a little white rotunda with two wings, brightened up with green shutters, the bucolic dream of Jean Jacques"
6247,"Every day, at four o’clock in the afternoon, a jailer, escorted by two dogs,—this was still in vogue at that time,—entered his cage, deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds, a jug of water, a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon, in which swam a few Mayagan beans, inspected his irons and tapped the bars"
6248,"There he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair which he had undergone, still hidden by the night, but telling himself that the day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at the idea of hearing the neighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within a few minutes, an hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found asleep under the pierced roof, staring in horror at a terrible depth, at the light of the street lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that pavement longed for yet frightful, which meant death, and which meant liberty"
6249,"the first light of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his livid cheek-bones, his sharp and savage nose, his bristling gray beard, and Gavroche recognized him"
6250,"The classic Academician who calls flowers “Flora,” fruits, “Pomona,” the sea, “Neptune,” love, “fires,” beauty, “charms,” a horse, “a courser,” the white or tricolored cockade, “the rose of Bellona,” the three-cornered hat, “Mars’ triangle,”—that classical Academician talks slang"
6251,"It is black in misfortune, it is blacker still in crime;"
6252,"Terrible, toad-like tongue which goes and comes, leaps, crawls, slobbers, and stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night, of hunger, of vice, of falsehood, of injustice, of nudity, of suffocation, and of winter, the high noonday of the miserable"
6253,"guedouze, death, which comes from guenn-du, black-white"
6254,"Must it remain there, without a gleam of light, without hope, given over to that terrible approach, vaguely scented out by the monster, shuddering, dishevelled, wringing its arms, forever chained to the rock of night, a sombre Andromeda white and naked amid the shadows!"
6255,The principal spring of the red spectre is broken
6256,"The ideal is frightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small, isolated, imperceptible, brilliant, but surrounded by those great, black menaces, monstrously heaped around it;"
6257,"The passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared not peer into the black niche, and was greatly alarmed"
6258,"This passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few instants later, six men, who were marching separately and at some distance from each other, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol, entered the Rue Plumet"
6259,A black figure barring the way stops the wild beast short
6260,"He possessed her smile, her breath, her perfume, the profound radiance of her blue eyes, the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand, the charming mark which she had on her neck, all her thoughts"
6261,She turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom
6262,"He was alone in his chamber, amid its pastoral scenes, with his feet propped on the andirons, half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer, with its nine leaves, with his elbow resting on a table where burned two candles under a green shade, engulfed in his tapestry armchair, and in his hand a book which he was not reading"
6263,"You have your thirty-two teeth, a good digestion, bright eyes, strength, appetite, health, gayety, a forest of black hair;"
6264,"I have no longer even white hair, I have lost my teeth, I am losing my legs, I am losing my memory;"
6265,"He had on his workman’s waistcoat, and trousers of gray linen;"
6266,"This was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar were white, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the fine, fresh plaster"
6267,"he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child, not so large as a man, clad in a gray blouse and trousers of dust-colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the moat of the Champ-de-Mars"
6268,"Marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house, which was as black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty"
6269,"The Revolution of July had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followed by blue sky"
6270,"Revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the Parisian character, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety, students proving that bravery forms part of intelligence, the National Guard invincible, bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses of street urchins, contempt of death on the part of passers-by"
6271,"The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, and with a rope’s end round his neck, mounts the white cockade"
6272,"As the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted to match"
6273,"Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, the sectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law School, the Medical School, refugees of all nationalities, and Spanish, Italian, German, and Polish flags, tricolored horizontal banners, every possible sort of banner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters and carpenters who were on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by their paper caps, marching two by two, three by three, uttering cries, nearly all of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, without order and yet with a single soul, now a tumultuous rout, again a column"
6274,"“Do you see that fellow with a red beard, he’s the one who will give the word when we are to fire"
6275,"” It appears that this red beard was present, at another riot, the Quénisset affair, entrusted with this same function"
6276,"All at once, a man on horseback, clad in black, made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pike surmounted with a red liberty-cap"
6277,"This red flag raised a storm, and disappeared in the midst of it"
6278,"In the Rue des Nonaindières, a very well-dressed bourgeois, who had a prominent belly, a sonorous voice, a bald head, a lofty brow, a black beard, and one of these stiff moustaches which will not lie flat, offered cartridges publicly to passers-by"
6279,"In the Rue Saint-Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare arms carried about a black flag, on which could be read in white letters this inscription:"
6280,One of these flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of white between
6281,"The detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag, a package of cartridges, and three hundred pistol-balls"
6282,"Another, with a naked sword, a blue police cap on his head, placed sentinels"
6283,"In front of the Cour-Batave, a detachment of National Guards found a red flag bearing the following inscription:"
6284,"The errand-boy next door has a little pointed beard, I have seen him pass every day with a young person in a pink bonnet on his arm;"
6285,"Her ears were very wide apart, her saddle deep, a fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, strongly articulated knees, prominent ribs, oblique shoulders and a powerful crupper"
6286,"“You see!” shrieked the hair-dresser, who from white had turned blue, “that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it"
6287,"For my part I don’t tremble before a poppy, the little red hat inspires me with no alarm"
6288,"Take my advice, bourgeois, let’s leave fear of the red to horned cattle"
6289,"Here Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard who was watching them as they passed, probably a Friend of the A B C"
6290,"In the last century, the worthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the stiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop at the very table where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted, by way of gratitude, a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post"
6291,"he had dipped a brush in a pot of black paint, and as he was an orthographer on his own account, as well as a cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall this remarkable inscription:—"
6292,"Gibelotte, tall, delicate, white with a lymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids, always languid and weary, afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude, the first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on every one, even the other maid, silently and gently, smiling through her fatigue with a vague and sleepy smile"
6293,The good God has his hands perpetually black with that cart-grease
6294,what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes!
6295,"and when I see so much distress in heaven and on earth, from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a hundred thousand livres of income, when I see human destiny, which is very badly worn, and even royal destiny, which is threadbare, witness the Prince de Condé hung, when I see winter, which is nothing but a rent in the zenith through which the wind blows, when I see so many rags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills, when I see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see the frost, that paste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events patched up, and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon, when I see so much misery everywhere, I suspect that God is not rich"
6296,"There is, in fact, in the matter of inebriety, white magic and black magic;"
6297,wine is only white magic
6298,"Gavroche and Bahorel had seized in its passage, and overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau;"
6299,An omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street
6300,"One had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two holster-pistols, another was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat, and a powder-horn slung at his side, a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a saddler’s awl"
6301,"Another spread out over his coat the cross-belt and cartridge-box of a National Guardsman, the cover of the cartridge-box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted:"
6302,"The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes, and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over the barricade"
6303,"The street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom, and nothing was to be seen except the red flag formidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern"
6304,"but, from the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into a sort of brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on"
6305,"Nevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for a tiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and at this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-haired old man, who was the porter, and who held a candle"
6306,"The murderer turned round and saw before him Enjolras’ cold, white face"
6307,"There were hardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock frocks, blouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads"
6308,"The lanterns of that date resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes, and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider"
6309,"A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to him that he could make out something white in front of him"
6310,It was two white horses;
6311,The whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps
6312,"A black sky rested on these dead streets, as though an immense winding-sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb"
6313,"Nevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on the Saint-Eustache side"
6314,Marius directed his steps towards that red light
6315,"He thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been so proud a soldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, and had touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa, Alexandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, who had left on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops of that same blood, which he, Marius, had in his veins, who had grown gray before his time in discipline and command, who had lived with his sword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling on his breast, his cockade blackened with powder, his brow furrowed with his helmet, in barracks, in camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, and who, at the expiration of twenty years, had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek, a smiling countenance, tranquil, admirable, pure as a child, having done everything for France and nothing against her"
6316,"In short, what cause is more just, and consequently, what war is greater, than that which re-establishes social truth, restores her throne to liberty, restores the people to the people, restores sovereignty to man, replaces the purple on the head of France, restores equity and reason in their plenitude, suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself, annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord, and places the human race once more on a level with the right?"
6317,"The Rue de la Chanvrerie, of which a few paving-stones alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag, offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a smoke"
6318,The red flag fell
6319,"his white locks, his decrepit face, his lofty, bald, and wrinkled brow, his amazed and open mouth, his aged arm upholding the red banner, rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch, and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of ’ emerging from the earth, with the flag of terror in his hand"
6320,"In the midst of this silence, the old man waved the red flag and shouted:—"
6321,They threw a long black shawl of Widow Hucheloup’s over Father Mabeuf
6322,"She raised her hand to Marius, and in the middle of that hand Marius saw a black hole"
6323,The white angel and the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the abyss
6324,"The passions and loves which succeed each other had not produced in him those successive green growths, tender green or dark green, which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty"
6325,"in a twinkling, that strange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, and was lost there, like smoke in the dark;"
6326,"He fumbled in one of his pockets, and pulled from it a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter"
6327,"those before whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of June, will never forget them"
6328,a vast red flag flapped in the wind;
6329,"From distance to distance, one could distinguish on the gray surface, almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads"
6330,I remember a white butterfly which went and came in the street
6331,"he had broad shoulders, a red face, a crushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere and terrible eye"
6332,"Barthélemy, on occasion, flew but one flag, the black flag"
6333,The pavement was red for a long time at that spot
6334,In the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth and Javert bound to his post
6335,"The combatants, as they went and came, moved about there like black forms"
6336,"The sky was of that charming, undecided hue, which may be white and may be blue"
6337,The morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the dead man at the third-story window
6338,think of the white locks
6339,"You could see him approach the stove, in which there was never any fire, and whose pipe, you know, was of mastic and yellow clay"

6341,"Not a living being in the crossroads, which gleamed white in the light of the sun"
6342,"That innocent bud which opens, that adorable half-nudity which is afraid of itself, that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper, that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye, that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle, those cords tied, those clasps fastened, those laces drawn, those tremors, those shivers of cold and modesty, that exquisite affright in every movement, that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm, the successive phases of dressing, as charming as the clouds of dawn,—it is not fitting that all this should be narrated, and it is too much to have even called attention to it"
6343,"An oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God, but that Adam looked upon her when she was unfolding, and she was ashamed and turned crimson"
6344,"A few feet below Cosette’s window, in the ancient and perfectly black cornice of the wall, there was a martin’s nest;"
6345,"Exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the black flag, he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps, who were holding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had arrived, and who were allowing “the insurrection to fry in its own fat,” to use the celebrated expression of one of them"
6346,"magnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil spectators of sorrow, who do not behold Nero if the weather be fair, for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile, who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light, who hear neither the cry nor the sob, nor the death rattle, nor the alarm peal, for whom everything is well, since there is a month of May, who, so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads, declare themselves content, and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted"
6347,"The statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow pierced with light;"
6348,"A few yellow leaves, left over from the autumn, chased each other merrily, and seemed to be playing tricks on each other"

6350,"the great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green cloth on earth;"
6351,"The ring-dove found his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, the goldfinch found chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green finch found flies, the fly found infusoriæ, the bee found flowers"
6352,"All at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the green swan-hutch"
6353,"They perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships, as they are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche, with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures"
6354,This coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun
6355,"They laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, and spread over the two corpses the black shawl"
6356,one stares at something red on one’s finger nails
6357,"If the people lets fall a black ball, the idea is dried fruit;"
6358,"but it shook off the soldiers as the lion shakes off the dogs, and it was only covered with besiegers as the cliff is covered with foam, to reappear, a moment later, beetling, black and formidable"
6359,"These haggard, ragged, exhausted men, who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours, who had not slept, who had but a few more rounds to fire, who were fumbling in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges, nearly all of whom were wounded, with head or arm bandaged with black and blood-stained linen, with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled, and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords, became Titans"
6360,"The human form seemed impossible there, the combatants flamed forth there, and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that red glow of those salamanders of the fray"
6361,"Marius, still fighting, was so riddled with wounds, particularly in the head, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood, and one would have said that his face was covered with a red kerchief"
6362,"Beneath the black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible, one large, the other small, and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the cold folds of the shroud"
6363,"The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain, whence dripped long, red and smoking streams, the uproar was indescribable;"
6364,"They are the meadow in flower, the green grass, wild thyme, thyme and sage, they are game, they are cattle, they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in the evening, they are perfumed hay, they are golden wheat, they are the bread on your table, they are the warm blood in your veins, they are health, they are joy, they are life"

6367,How was he to find his bearings in that black labyrinth?
6368,"It would be better to plunge into that labyrinth, to confide themselves to that black gloom, and to trust to Providence for the outcome"
6369,"the group of black forms vanished, a glimmer of light oscillated and floated, communicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter, then disappeared;"
6370,To be dressed in blue is glorious;
6371,to be dressed in red is disagreeable
6372,There is a purple from below
6373,It is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which the first man is desirous of shirking
6374,"His eyes were closed, his hair was plastered down on his temples like a painter’s brushes dried in red wash;"
6375,"Instead of the open air, the broad daylight, the clear horizon, those vast sounds, those free clouds whence rains life, instead of those barks descried in the distance, of that hope under all sorts of forms, of probable passers-by, of succor possible up to the very last moment,—instead of all this, deafness, blindness, a black vault, the inside of a tomb already prepared, death in the mire beneath a cover!"
6376,"it was good, white light"

6378,"They were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death, and Jean Valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows"

6380,"The coachman, a black form on his box, whipped up his thin horses"
6381,"He stood astonished on the threshold, one hand on the handle of the half-open door, with his head bent a little forward and quivering, his body wrapped in a white dressing-gown, which was straight and as destitute of folds as a winding-sheet;"
6382,"He saw the bed, and on the mattress that young man, bleeding, white with a waxen whiteness, with closed eyes and gaping mouth, and pallid lips, stripped to the waist, slashed all over with crimson wounds, motionless and brilliantly lighted up"
6383,"The grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified limbs can tremble, his eyes, whose corneæ were yellow on account of his great age, were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter, his whole face assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull, his arms fell pendent, as though a spring had broken, and his amazement was betrayed by the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands, which quivered all over, his knees formed an angle in front, allowing, through the opening in his dressing-gown, a view of his poor bare legs, all bristling with white hairs, and he murmured:"
6384,to behold a rift in the immense blue pane of the firmament!
6385,"and, erect, at the summit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head and a halo round his brow;"
6386,"it is invariably ornamented with a box-wood saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer box of cardboard filled with red wafers, and it forms the lowest stage of official style"
6387,"A moment later, a tall black figure, which a belated passer-by in the distance might have taken for a phantom, appeared erect upon the parapet of the quay, bent over towards the Seine, then drew itself up again, and fell straight down into the shadows;"
6388,"Every day, sometimes twice a day, a very well dressed gentleman with white hair,—such was the description given by the porter,—came to inquire about the wounded man, and left a large package of lint for the dressings"
6389,His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance of his visage
6390,"With Cosette, and behind her, there had entered a man with white hair who was grave yet smiling, though with a vague and heartrending smile"
6391,"He was very well dressed, as the porter had said, entirely in black, in perfectly new garments, and with a white cravat"
6392,"Your beautiful white hands, Madame la Baronne, will do the devil the honor of pulling him by the tail"
6393,and by the green cabbages!
6394,"There was a void in his memory, a black spot, an abyss excavated by four months of agony"
6395,"It seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb, and that he had entered into it black and had emerged from it white, and in that tomb the others had remained"
6396,"a blue waistcoat turned up with red, and with bell buttons, a plaque like a vantbrace, knee-breeches of green leather, oaths to the Norman horses with their tails knotted up, false galloons, varnished hat, long powdered locks, an enormous whip and tall boots"
6397,"It rained that day, but there is always in the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness, which lovers see, even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella"
6398,"” A pile of Cassandras, Harlequins and Columbines, jolted along high above the passers-by, all possible grotesquenesses, from the Turk to the savage, Hercules supporting Marquises, fishwives who would have made Rabelais stop up his ears just as the Mænads made Aristophanes drop his eyes, tow wigs, pink tights, dandified hats, spectacles of a grimacer, three-cornered hats of Janot tormented with a butterfly, shouts directed at pedestrians, fists on hips, bold attitudes, bare shoulders, immodesty unchained;"
6399,"sarcasm flames forth, joviality is flaunted like a red flag;"
6400,"In the meanwhile, two other maskers in the same carriage, a Spaniard with an enormous nose, an elderly air, and huge black moustache, and a gaunt fishwife, who was quite a young girl, masked with a loup, had also noticed the wedding, and while their companions and the passers-by were exchanging insults, they had held a dialogue in a low voice"
6401,“The one with his arm hung up in a black cravat?”
6402,"Cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta, her robe of Binche guipure, a veil of English point, a necklace of fine pearls, a wreath of orange flowers;"
6403,"When, at the conclusion of all the ceremonies, after having pronounced before the mayor and before the priest all possible “yesses,” after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy, after having exchanged their rings, after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer, they arrived, hand in hand, admired and envied by all, Marius in black, she in white, preceded by the suisse, with the epaulets of a colonel, tapping the pavement with his halberd, between two rows of astonished spectators, at the portals of the church, both leaves of which were thrown wide open, ready to enter their carriage again, and all being finished, Cosette still could not believe that it was real"
6404,"People halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of Saint-Paul, to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers quivering on Cosette’s head"
6405,"In the centre, above the white and glittering table, was a Venetian lustre with flat plates, with all sorts of colored birds, blue, violet, red, and green, perched amid the candles;"
6406,"She set her sweet little foot, shod in white satin, on Marius’ foot"
6407,"Can there be too many perfumes, too many open rose-buds, too many nightingales singing, too many green leaves, too much aurora in life?"
6408,Love has the right to a long white beard
6409,"If it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper life, it is probable that we should behold the forms of night, the winged unknowns, the blue passers of the invisible, bend down, a throng of sombre heads, around the luminous house, satisfied, showering benedictions, pointing out to each other the virgin wife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances"
6410,"This was the very room which, eight months before, he had entered black with mud, with blood and powder, bringing back the grandson to the grandfather"
6411,"Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, white stockings and white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishes that were to be served"
6412,"first the little gown, then the black fichu, then the stout, coarse child’s shoes which Cosette might almost have worn still, so tiny were her feet, then the fustian bodice, which was very thick, then the knitted petticoat, next the apron with pockets, then the woollen stockings"
6413,All this was black of hue
6414,"It was in winter, in a very cold month of December, she was shivering, half-naked, in rags, her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes"
6415,"Then his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, that stoical old heart broke, his face was engulfed, so to speak, in Cosette’s garments, and if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment, he would have heard frightful sobs"
6416,"And, after having dislocated, broken, and rent his conscience with red-hot pincers, it had said to him, as it stood over him, formidable, luminous, and tranquil:"
6417,"Oh, second step, how black art thou!"
6418,"one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron, one places on one’s head the crown of hot iron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, one takes the sceptre of red hot iron, but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned, and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering?"
6419,His black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has been up all night
6420,"Jean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm, unrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb and showed it to Marius"
6421,There would have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable white locks and tainted white locks;
6422,You and Cosette and I would have had all three of our heads in the green cap!
6423,"“When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has not the right to make others share it without their knowledge, one has not the right to make them slip over one’s own precipice without their perceiving it, one has not the right to let one’s red blouse drag upon them, one has no right to slyly encumber with one’s misery the happiness of others"
6424,"She was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown, with a thousand folds and large sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to her feet"
6425,You remember her blue plush hat
6426,"In vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may one taste the grand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force even the archangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, to shudder"
6427,"This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud became black once more"
6428,"However, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, who was as candid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing;"
6429,"The room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on the ground floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on the street, was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window"
6430,"A fine web, which spread far and wide, and was very black and ornamented with dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes"
6431,"The wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was scaling off in large flakes"
6432,At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black with a narrow shelf
6433,I always have loved my black corner
6434,"One afternoon,—it was on one of those early days in April, already warm and fresh, the moment of the sun’s great gayety, the gardens which surrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking, the hawthorn was on the point of budding, a jewelled garniture of gillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance, the wind, that minstrel of the eternal wedding, was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand, auroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide,—Marius said to Cosette:—“We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the Rue Plumet"
6435,"His portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed:"
6436,He’s as white as a chicken
6437,"Then he turned towards the bed, and, still seated, for he could not stand, he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects"
6438,"White jet comes from Norway, black jet comes from England, black glass jewellery comes from Germany"
6439,"Buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast, by means of this wax, to a little framework of black iron"
6440,"The glass must be violet for iron jewellery, and black for gold jewellery"
6441,"This man, who was old, moreover, had a thick nose, his chin swathed in a cravat, green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes, and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in “high life"
6442,"He was dressed in black from head to foot, in garments that were very threadbare but clean;"
6443,"His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into which roguery retreated"
6444,"The suit of the statesman, for instance, black from head to foot, and consequently proper, would have been too large for Pitt and too small for Castelcicala"
6445,"“A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, boots and linen"
6446,"“In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green glasses, seals, and two small quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton"
6447,"The stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs, drew himself up without straightening his dorsal column, but scrutinizing Marius in his turn, with the green gaze of his spectacles"
6448,"In a trade, the manufacture of black glass goods, he made the fortune of an entire city"
6449,"Thénardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper, which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes"
6450,"Thénardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket, and holding, on a level with his eyes, nipped between his two thumbs and his two forefingers, a strip of torn black cloth, all covered with dark spots"
6451,"Marius had sprung to his feet, pale, hardly able to draw his breath, with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth, and, without uttering a word, without taking his eyes from that fragment, he retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney"
6452,"“The young man was myself, and here is the coat!” cried Marius, and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood"
6453,"And, seating herself on the old man’s knees, she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement, and kissed his brow"
6454,there are tiny violet shells
6455,"My poor, pretty, little robin red-breast which used to put her head out of her window and look at me!"
6456,"“Cosette, thou wert talking to me, go on, so thy little robin red-breast is dead?"
6457,"Black jet comes from England, white jet comes from Norway"
6458,"However, we could not equal the black glass of England"
6459,"your hands were red then, mademoiselle, they are very white now"
6460,"One day I gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow, blue and green feathers"
6461,"His white face looked up to heaven, he allowed Cosette and Marius to cover his hands with kisses"
6462,"The sores of the human race, those great sores which cover the globe, do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon the map"
6463,"the moment has at length arrived for tearing off that rag, and for replacing, upon the naked limbs of the Man-People, the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn"
6464,Let it not be said that patriots have hoisted the white flag
6465,a sobriquet given to hairdressers because they are white with powder
6466,"With a blue capote and a chicken in his shako, here’s the banlieue, co-cocorico"
6467,"In his right waistcoat-pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong cable, and marked with black figures;"
6468,"In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round flat pieces of white and red metal, of different bulk;"
6469,In the left pocket were two black pillars irregularly shaped:
6470,"but at the upper end of the other there appeared a white round substance, about twice the bigness of our heads"
6471,"we found therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real gold, must be of immense value"
6472,"the other cell contained a heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands"
6473,"I was diverted with none so much as that of the rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread, extended about two feet, and twelve inches from the ground"
6474,"Whoever performs his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping and creeping, is rewarded with the blue-coloured silk;"
6475,"the red is given to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice round about the middle;"
6476,"About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was entertaining the court with this kind of feat, there arrived an express to inform his majesty, that some of his subjects, riding near the place where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on the around, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round, as wide as his majesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man;"
6477,"Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise with his white staff;"
6478,"whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity"
6479,"I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a clean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a man of war"
6480,"the prejudices of his education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other, after a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, “whether I was a whig or tory?” Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed “how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive insects as I:"
6481,"While she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel that belonged to one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I lay:"
6482,"For if, in its perihelion, it should approach within a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations they have reason to dread) it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron, and in its absence from the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen miles long, through which, if the earth should pass at the distance of one hundred thousand miles from the nucleus, or main body of the comet, it must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes:"
6483,"or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent forgetfulness;"
6484,"when the king has a mind to put any of his nobles to death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands the floor to be strewed with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition, which being licked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours"
6485,"” He told me “that sometimes, though very rarely, a child happened to be born in a family, with a red circular spot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was an infallible mark that it should never die"
6486,"the black spot on the forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not have easily overlooked it:"
6487,"He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large pieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers), and a red diamond, which I sold in England for eleven hundred pounds"
6488,"but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might see their skins, which were of a brown buff colour"
6489,"The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his right fore-hoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust it better by taking it off and settling it again;"
6490,"whereat, both he and his companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised:"
6491,"and the gray repeated the same word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right accent;"
6492,and the gray made me signs that I should walk before him;
6493,"The gray came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill treatment which the others might have given me"
6494,"Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend:"
6495,"for the gray horse came to the door, and made me a sign to follow him into the third room where I saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches upon mats of straw, not unartfully made, and perfectly neat and clean"
6496,The gray ordered me to stand by him;
6497,"I happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed perplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my forefeet"
6498,The horse immediately ordered a white mare servant of his family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray
6499,"but the younger, and the females, were much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as white as milk"
6500,"I said, “there was a society of men among us, bred up from their youth in the art of proving, by words multiplied for the purpose, that white is black, and black is white, according as they are paid"
6501,but whether the said cow were red or black;
6502,"I forgot another circumstance (and perhaps I might have the reader’s pardon if it were wholly omitted), that while I held the odious vermin in my hands, it voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my clothes;"
6503,"It is observed, that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed in strength and activity"
6504,"Neither was the hair of this brute of a red colour (which might have been some excuse for an appetite a little irregular), but black as a sloe, and her countenance did not make an appearance altogether so hideous as the rest of her kind;"
6505,I have seen a white mare of our family thread a needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that joint
6506,but it appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud:
6507,"A certain kind of rice, cooked with red beans, a festival dish denoting good fortune, is usually partaken of by the family on the seventh day"
6508,"This sometimes consists of the red bean rice, such as is prepared for the seventh day celebration, and sometimes of cakes of mochi, or rice paste"
6509,"Another consequence, as I imagine, of the lack of proper food at the teething period, is the early loss of the child's first teeth, which usually turn black and decay some time before the second teeth begin to show themselves"
6510,"A very young baby wears red and yellow, but soon the boy is dressed in sober colors,—blues, grays, greens, and browns;"
6511,"while the little girl still wears the most gorgeous of colors and the largest of patterns in her garments, red being the predominant hue"
6512,and the gorgeous soiled gowns are not as attractive as the more washable white garments in which our babies are dressed
6513,"And then there is the feast most loved in the whole year, the Feast of Dolls, when on the third day of the third month the great fire-proof storehouse gives forth its treasures of dolls,—in an old family, many of them hundreds of years old,—and for three days, with all their belongings of tiny furnishings in silver, lacquer, and porcelain, they reign supreme, arranged on red-covered shelves in the finest room of the house"
6514,"At this house, where the dolls had been accumulating for hundreds of years, five or six broad, red-covered shelves, perhaps twenty feet long or more, were completely filled with them and with their belongings"
6515,"The saké used on this occasion is a sweet, white liquor, brewed especially for this feast, as different from the ordinary saké as sweet cider is from the hard cider upon which a man may drink himself into a state of intoxication"
6516,"lacquered bullock carts, drawn by bow-legged black bulls,—these were the conveyances of the great in Old Japan, and these, in minute reproductions, are placed upon the red-covered shelves"
6517,"All presents in Japan must be wrapped in white paper, although, except for funerals, this paper must have some writing on it, and must be tied with a peculiar red and white paper string, in which is inserted the noshi, or bit of dried fish, daintily folded in a piece of colored paper, which is an indispensable accompaniment of every present"
6518,"The tea, instead of being the whole leaf, such as is used for ordinary occasions, is a fine, green powder"
6519,"Besides the entertainment, presents of red rice, or mochi, are sent as a token of thanks to all who have remembered the young couple"

6863,"That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,"" said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before"
6864,"""See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green silk, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty rack and stool, all complete,"" added Meg, opening the instrument and displaying its beauties"
6865,"It had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple-pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals"
6866,"I'll have a grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week"
6867,"Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk"
6868,"The word 'limes' was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with unusual rapidity"
6869,"At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance"
6870,"All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears"
6871,"A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny Snow helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them"
6872,"""You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else could,"" answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery"
6873,"But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the gorgeous princes and princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it"
6874,"The fairy queen's yellow curls reminded her of Amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her 'sorry for it'"
6875,"She tried to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in them, and for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring with a terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water"
6876,"""A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a lovely blue sash"
6877,"I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't time to make it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlaton"
6878,"""Now, let me see, there's my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn't it?"
6879,The violet silk would be so nice
6880,"My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that I feel as if I'd got a new one"
6881,"I told Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle"
6882,"""Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps"
6883,"There now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for Mother to pack,"" said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton, which she called her 'ball dress' with an important air"
6884,"No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms"
6885,"""I've got my new pink silk for Thursday and don't want a thing"
6886,"""My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it got sadly torn last night,"" said Meg, trying to speak quite easily, but feeling very uncomfortable"
6887,"There's no need of sending home, Daisy, even if you had a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away, which I've outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won't you, dear?"""
6888,"A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show"
6889,"A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart"
6890,"""Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,"" said Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of"
6891,"What does he want?"" said Laurie, knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party"
6892,"Meg's had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it"
6893,"Amy had a bower in hers, rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at, with honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there"
6894,"Three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with a big 'P"
6895,"Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was"
6896,"Meg, who went shopping in the afternoon and got a 'sweet blue muslin', had discovered, after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her slightly cross"
6897,"By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and the stove was red-hot"
6898,"A strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she'd come to dinner"
6899,"Now this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw"
6900,"""Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one,"" said Meg, looking at the gray cotton glove"
6901,"Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in her gingham morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her forehead, and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable, full of tidy white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her mother's mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers flew and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that Mrs. March smiled and was satisfied"
6902,"""Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me"
6903,"You shall not make a guy of yourself,"" remonstrated Meg, as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke"
6904,"Mr. Brooke was a grave, silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice"
6905,"Sallie Gardiner was absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks"
6906,"A pleasant green field, with three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of turf for croquet"
6907,"The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables, prettily decorated with green leaves"
6908,"There was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on"
6909,"Three white-headed children peeped over the fence, and an objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river with all his might and main"
6910,"Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr. Brooke obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river"
6911,"""A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old fellow in a black gown fired at him,"" said Ned"
6912,"""A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand,"" went on Meg"
6913,"Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful eyes through its white veil"
6914,"'Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard alee, and man the guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast"
6915,"Down the page went the green guide, and presently, forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read as if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the unhappy queen"
6916,"If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would have stopped short, but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her"
6917,"Staring up into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world, when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash"
6918,"Each wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch slung over one shoulder, and carried a long staff"
6919,"A grove of pines covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets"
6920,"Meg sat upon her cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green"
6921,"Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky"
6922,"Gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops, and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City"
6923,"There's a demand for socks just now,"" added Jo, waving hers like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate"
6924,"That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight, Laurie, standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the little David, whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit, and watched the old man, who sat with his gray head on his hand, thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much"
6925,"Then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been"
6926,"This maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite"
6927,In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort
6928,"""They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw hats"
6929,"""My patience, how blue we are!"" cried Jo"
6930,"At the word 'telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two lines it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart"
6931,"Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and Meg, come and help me find my things, for I'm half bewildered"
6932,"Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother"
6933,"As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle, and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it, ""It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth"
6934,"In a barber's window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars"
6935,"Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk"
6936,In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before
6937,"He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away"
6938,"Queen of my tub, I merrily sing, While the white foam rises high, And sturdily wash and rinse and wring, And fasten the clothes to dry"
6939,"The sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out, and Meg put in new ones, but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress"
6940,"She done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she starched 'em afore they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should a died a laughin"
6941,"Half an hour after, Jo went to 'Mother's closet' for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand"
6942,"She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall"
6943,"Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied head down on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of moving from the table where she left it"
6944,"Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute, for he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing the girls or harming Beth"
6945,"Laurie lay on the rug, pretending to rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear"
6946,"Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and gray hairs, can sympathize with children's little cares and joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest way"
6947,"There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover's diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring, too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all"
6948,""" And Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it"
6949,"Esther had given her a rosary of black beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it, feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers"
6950,"So busy was she on this day that she did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting her fan and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban, contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted petticoat"
6951,"""That bird is the trial of my life,"" she continued, removing the pink mountain from her head, while Laurie seated himself astride a chair"
6952,"To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with pockets—also my likeness, and my medal, with much love"
6953,"To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her 'little girl'"
6954,"To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him for his favors to her family, especially Beth"
6955,I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss
6956,"Did anyone tell you about Beth's giving away her things?"" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him"
6957,"She read the short reports he sent more than she did your letters, and pinched me when I spoke of it, and likes brown eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly name, and she'll go and fall in love, and there's an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together"
6958,"I caught her singing that song he gave her, and once she said 'John', as you do, and then turned as red as a poppy"
6959,"Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for 'the dear', while Amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept"
6960,"Out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly, bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll of music in the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer"
6961,"""How can I be otherwise?"" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her eyes went from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her breast"
6962,"The study door flew open, the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the feeble limbs, and Beth ran straight into her father's arms"
6963,"Jo saw and understood the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea, muttering to herself as she slammed the door, ""I hate estimable young men with brown eyes!"""
6964,"""I remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so"
6965,"Meg, my dear, I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments"
6966,"I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me"
6967,"""I read in Pilgrim's Progress today how, after many troubles, Christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey's end,"" answered Beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father's arms and went to the instrument, ""It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old place"
6968,"""Shall I tell you how?"" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen"
6969,Earnest young men found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they;
6970,That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared for Meg's first home
6971,"""If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and missis would have to camp in the garden,"" broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles"
6972,"As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg, pulled Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's big pinafore, and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all round, and everyone began to talk"
6973,"Just now it's the fashion to be hideous, to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots"
6974,"Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have"
6975,"There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today"
6976,"These offending features gave character to her whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than ever"
6977,"All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood"
6978,"""Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than mosquitoes,"" whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and Laurie's black head towered above the rest"
6979,"There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green arch"
6980,"Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes"
6981,"Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair"
6982,"While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire"
6983,"oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant Rembrandt;"
6984,"and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a king's robe, as the spectator pleased"
6985,"""Please don't—it's—it's mine,"" murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red as her fish"
6986,"Her 'scribbling suit' consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action"
6987,"At such times the intruder silently withdrew, and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow, did anyone dare address Jo"
6988,"Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna"
6989,"Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg longed for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black silk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls"
6990,"That was only a month to wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had the money, if she only dared to take it"
6991,"The kind, brown eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had found her out, but didn't mean to let her know it"
6992,"Aren't they beauties?"" said the proud papa, beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels"
6993,"""Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French fashion, so you can always tell"
6994,"Besides, one has blue eyes and one brown"
6995,"Do your hair the pretty way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet"
6996,"We'll stop at Meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can have my dove-colored one"
6997,"Your head is all I could ask, for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing"
6998,"""You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,"" said Jo, looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair"
6999,"Just be calm, cool, and quiet, that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes,"" said Amy, as they approached the first place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg, with a baby on each arm"
7000,"""Well, I call that plucky!"" and young Mr. Lamb turned an approving glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable"
7001,"Why, she wanted a pair of blue boots for Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly like satin,"" added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments that exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her"
7002,"Mr. Tudor's uncle had married an English lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded the whole family with great respect, for in spite of her American birth and breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of us—that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled"
7003,"I think well of him, and like to show that I do, for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels"
7004,"Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet, blue and gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers, were the words, ""Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"
7005,"""Suppose you haven't?"" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy"
7006,"Jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished, when she retired to her refuge, the garret, and cried till she couldn't cry any more"
7007,"It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast, and found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins here and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's countryseats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks"
7008,"Amy, flying up—""Oh, that must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!"" Flo, darting to my window—""How sweet!"
7009,"A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw"
7010,"At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said"
7011,"It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and powdered coachmen in front"
7012,"Smart maids, with the rosiest children I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies in queer English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side, looking so funny I longed to sketch them"
7013,"She would like the relics of great people better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and gray coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's sword, and many other interesting things"
7014,"I've seen the imperial family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, I thought—purple dress, green hat, and yellow gloves"
7015,"Little Nap is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his tutor, and kisses his hand to the people as he passes in his four-horse barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted guard before and behind"
7016,"I wish Fred was dark, for I don't fancy light men, however, the Vaughns are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won't find fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower"
7017,"He isn't one of the cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes"
7018,"I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it"
7019,"A regular German—rather stout, with brown hair tumbled all over his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I ever saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good, after our sharp or slipshod American gabble"
7020,"It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other"
7021,"Books and papers everywhere, a broken meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other"
7022,"I am too stupid to learn,"" I blundered out, as red as a peony"
7023,"They were useful, pretty, or funny, a new standish on his table, a little vase for his flower, he always has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says, and a holder for his blower, so that he needn't burn up what Amy calls 'mouchoirs'"
7024,"I made it like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body, and black and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes"
7025,"I'd better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other people blow themselves up with my gunpowder,"" she thought as she watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black cinder with fiery eyes"
7026,"Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely broken and the world a howling wilderness, but at the sound of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced into his closing sentence, the broken heart gave an unexpected leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling wilderness"
7027,"A white-winged gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast"
7028,"A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping over the beach 'peeping' softly to itself, as if enjoying the sun and sea"
7029,"At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world at Nice may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais—a charming place, for the wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs, is bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive, lined with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and the hills"
7030,"He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an Englishman, and had the independent air of an American—a combination which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly after him, and sundry dandies in black velvet suits, with rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange flowers in their buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy him his inches"
7031,"Where now?"" asked Laurie, leaning back and folding his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred to drive, for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white ponies' backs afforded her infinite satisfaction"
7032,"While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched him, and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside her"
7033,"At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving the reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the shady road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly as in June"
7034,"""I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,"" said Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball dress, and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect"
7035,"Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion, Amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines"
7036,"Remembering the painted boots, she surveyed her white satin slippers with girlish satisfaction, and chasseed down the room, admiring her aristocratic feet all by herself"
7037,"It so happened that she could not have done a better thing, for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress, the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a well-placed statue"
7038,"A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an hour and talk with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin"
7039,The golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with a dashing French-woman who carpeted the floor with her pink satin train
7040,"Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility, and Laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged"
7041,""" and Amy rubbed her brilliant cheek, and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity that made him laugh outright"
7042,"Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial admiration"
7043,"No coaxing, no sugar, no lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the red glow of the fire enlivened the 'big dark' which Demi regarded with curiosity rather than fear"
7044,"It cost him no effort to be generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in Nice if she would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise"
7045,"Meek, mouse-colored donkeys, laden with panniers of freshly cut grass passed by, with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the green piles, or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went"
7046,"Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky"
7047,"Every shadowy nook, where seats invited one to stop and rest, was a mass of bloom, every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson, white, or pale pink roses, leaning down to smile at their own beauty"
7048,"Roses covered the walls of the house, draped the cornices, climbed the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace, whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and the white-walled city on its shore"
7049,"He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose, for vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like that from the greenhouse at home"
7050,"It's as soft and white as a woman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's best gloves and pick flowers for ladies"
7051,"The feeble fingers were never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for the school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens from her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and all manner of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and needs"
7052,"This phantom wore many faces, but it always had golden hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and floated airily before his mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses, peacocks, white ponies, and blue ribbons"
7053,"Tumbling about in one part of the desk among bills, passports, and business documents of various kinds were several of Jo's letters, and in another compartment were three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside"
7054,"But the letter telling that Beth was failing never reached Amy, and when they next found her the grass was green above her sister"
7055,"A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake, with chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny water"
7056,"Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament"
7057,"As he sat down beside her, Amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting"
7058,"Bernard and the Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in the valley, and Lausanne upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue sky overhead, and the bluer lake below, dotted with the picturesque boats that look like white-winged gulls"
7059,"When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said very humbly, ""Father, talk to me as you did to Beth"
7060,"An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased with the success of her suggestion"
7061,"No one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on Beth's little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming dreams, or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed far away"
7062,"That rosy cheeks don't last forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie brown hair, and that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as sweet as love and admiration now"
7063,"Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently smoothed the little red pillow, which he remembered well"
7064,"""She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,"" Mr. March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray head beside him"
7065,"""Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day"
7066,"The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the little blue ball"
7067,"Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but this,"" and Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding ring, as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness"
7068,"""It's your little mind, Demi,"" replied the sage, stroking the yellow head respectfully"
7069,"""Does I?"" and Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he took in the new thought"
7070,"Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the preceptor said, with undisturbed dignity, ""Good evening, Mr. Bhaer"
7071,"""I knows him!"" and, after a few convulsive efforts, the red legs took the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent pupil triumphantly shouted, ""It's a We, Dranpa, it's a We!"""
7072,"The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down"
7073,"Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought of her, but she didn't care, for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day"
7074,"It's a superior article, a most desirable color, quite chaste and genteel,"" he said, shaking out a comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders"
7075,"""Let it go, it has done its duty, and I will haf a fresh one when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little secrets,"" said Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind"
7076,"Birds twittered their adieux from the alders in the lane, and every tree stood ready to send down its shower of red or yellow apples at the first shake"
7077,"The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys, who made a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling"
7078,"""Fritz is getting gray and stout"
7079,"""Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one,"" began Mrs. March, frightening away a big black cricket that was staring Teddy out of countenance"
7080,"The only thing in its favour was that it had once been a much larger place than it was now, and a detached bit of lime avenue—very fine trees, forming in the summer two lovely walls of tender shade—was supposed in the traditions of the place to indicate where once the chief entrance and the best part of the mansion had been"
7081,"but the lawns that spread around were green and smooth as velvet, and the park, though not large,{} was full of fine trees"
7082,"A workbasket full of the most brilliant wools in the tidiest bundles, a German pattern printed in squares, a little pile of tradesmen’s books in red covers, and a small brown basket full of keys, were the signs of her little settlement in the hall"
7083,"The little roughness with which the one thrust his arm into the other’s spoke of itself a whole volume of sympathy, and they walked through the sunshine and under the flickering shadows of the trees, slowly and heavily, the curate with his head bent, and his brown beard, of which he was as proud as was becoming to a young clergyman, lying on his breast"
7084,But happily that rich brown beard of his hid the imbecility of this pathetic simple gaze
7085,"He was standing before a tall vase of white glass, almost as high as himself, in which he was arranging with great anxiety and interest a waving bouquet of tall ferns and feathery branches"
7086,"Douglas had been a month at the Rectory, and as his eyes followed the two Ashleys along the white sun-swept road and away under the shadow of the park trees, the idea came to him, with a curious sense of expansive and enlarged being, that the masses of foliage sweeping away towards the west, amid which the two solemn wayfarers soon disappeared, would one day, in all probability, be his own"
7087,He grew red in spite of himself under the gaze of the Rector’s mild and dull eyes
7088,"He went slowly on across the green fields, all bright in the sunshine, across the little stream, and up the leafy woodland road that led to the Beeches, his heart pleasantly agitated, his mind full of delightful anticipations"
7089,"The soil was rich and heavy round them with the shedding of their own leaves, and when the sun got in through their big branches and touched that brown carpet it shone like specks of gold"
7090,"From the elevation on which they stood the spectator looked down upon the house lying below among its gardens, on the green terrace and the limes, and could watch what the group there was doing, while himself safe from all observation"
7091,"He reached that spot so soon that he saw the beginning of the ‘game,’ and Anne’s white figure going back through the flower garden all blazing with colour, to the house"
7092,"Then, while the game went on in the bright foreground of the picture, he saw the moving speck of that white figure re-issuing on the other side of the house, and advancing towards him, threading her way among the trees"
7093,"It was for him that Anne did this, and he it was alone of all concerned who could sit here calmly puffing the blue smoke among the branches, and waiting for his happiness to come to him"
7094,"There was the peaceful house within sight, and the party on the green terrace absorbed in their inferior amusement, in complete ignorance, not knowing what romance was going on, scarcely out of their range of vision, under the trees"
7095,"It was she who at the end of many digressions finally discovered that while they had been talking the green terrace below had become vacant, the company dispersed"
7096,The red gleam of the pipe got reflected under his shaggy eyebrows in something liquid
7097,"Her slight white figure had the pose of a tall lily, so light, so firm, that its very fragility looked like strength"
7098,"She held her head high, erecting her white throat more like a lily than ever"
7099,"Next day it might be autumn with a frost-touch somewhere, the first yellow leaf;"
7100,"Even she, though she was half ashamed of herself, being plump, had put on, dazzled by the morning, a white gown"
7101,After luncheon the chairs were carried out to the green terrace where the shadow of the limes fell
7102,"The limes got in the way of the sun almost as soon as he began to descend, and threw the most delicious dancing shadow over the grass—a shadow that was quite effectual, and kept the lawn as cool as in the middle of a forest, but which was in itself a lovely living thing, in soft perpetual motion, every little twig and green silken leaf contributing its particular canopy, and flinging down a succession of little bobs and curtseys with every breath of air that blew"
7103,Mrs. Mountford had regretfully relinquished by this time her white gown
7104,"We all cling to our white gowns, but when you are stout, it must be acknowledged the experiment is rash"
7105,"She sat very still in her basket-chair, with all the lime leaves waving over her, letting in stray gleams of sunshine that ornamented her as with lines of jewels here and there"
7106,The black bread is wholesome fare enough when there is not some insolent happiness in the foreground insisting upon devouring before you its bunches of cake
7107,"The garden was sweet with all manner of autumn flowers, banks of mignonette and heliotrope perfuming the air, and red geraniums blazing in the sunshine—all artificial in their formal beds, just as this intercourse was artificial, restrained by the presence of spectators and the character of the scene"
7108,"he dropped his nice brown beard upon his bosom, and sighed, and slightly shook his head"
7109,"She was standing still at the corner of the garden, with once more two dark figures upon the white road, but this time not approaching—going away"
7110,the black bread of every day was all that now furnished forth the tables
7111,"I told him even about that time I was shut up in the blue room, and how frightened I was"
7112,They were walking up and down on the green terrace where so many games had been played
7113,It was getting almost too dark for the lime avenue when their talk had begun
7114,The day had faded so far that the red of the geraniums had almost gone out;
7115,I don’t pretend to be so uninstructed as to require to describe a lady’s dress as only of ‘some soft white material
7116,"He put his hand in his pocket to get the letter, and of course he forgot in which pocket he had put it, and then became red and confused, as was natural"
7117,He did not even feel within himself the healthy thrill of opposition with which the lowly born sometimes scorn the supposed superiority of blue blood
7118,"I think I can see a snuffy old laird in a blue bonnet, and a lumbering young lout scratching his red head"
7119,"‘that blue is too blue, it will never go with the others"
7120,"Old Saymore, with his white locks, was reflected in this from top to toe, and the shaking of the white head produced a singular commotion in it like circles in water"
7121,Rose’s blue and inexperienced orbs grew round and large with excitement
7122,"The much-expected visitor arrived in the twilight of an October evening just before dinner, and his first introduction to the family was in the indistinct light of the fire—one of the first fires of the season, which lighted up the drawing-room with a fitful ruddy blaze shining upon the white dresses of the girls, but scarcely revealing the elder people in their darker garments"
7123,"Rose’s bright little countenance lighted up, her blue eyes shone, her cheeks glowed"
7124,"They went through the park first, which was in all the glory of autumn colouring, the oaks and the beeches a wonder to see, and even the slim elms all golden standing up against a blue afternoon sky, in which already there began to appear faint beginnings of purple and crimson as the sun got westward;"
7125,"It was part of a tall red brick house, which formed an important feature in the scene, a house with many rows of windows, long and narrow, which twinkled in the setting sun"
7126,"The family lawyer was red and breathless, while his companion was choked and pale"
7127,"‘I will do anything that is in reason,’ Mr. Loseby said, not without a little emphasis which brought a tinge of red on his client’s countenance"
7128,"It was a beautiful clear October night, with frost in the air, the stars shining every minute more and{} more brightly, the crimson disappearing, even the last golden afterglow fading into palest yellow in the west, and all the great vault of sky darkening to perfect night"
7129,The lawn will be all yellow to-morrow with scattered gold
7130,"The lime trees will be stripped, and it is a pity, for they were pretty"
7131,The yellow leaves came down in showers flying on the wind
7132,‘She haunts that lime avenue
7133,"One wintry afternoon when November had begun, he drove over to Mount in his little phaeton with a blue bag on the seat beside him"
7134,"He shook his shining little bald head, and took up his blue bag from the table"
7135,"and though the trees stood up bare against the dark blue sky, and the grass looked too wet and spongy for pleasant riding, there was still some beauty in the dusky landscape"
7136,"With all these lights streaming out into the night, the house seemed to warm the evening air, which was now white with inevitable mists over the park"
7137,"and there, almost within reach, hanging suspended, as it were, between heaven and earth, were the lights of the house, showing with faint white haloes round them, those lights which had seemed so full of warmth and welcome"
7138,Old Saymore’s eyes were red and his hand unsteady
7139,"Keziah, the little maid to whom Anne had, during the interval since she was last mentioned, imparted a great deal of very energetic advice as to the duty of holding fast to her lover, and taking no thought of interest, had red eyes that night when she came to put her mistress’s things away"
7140,"She had red eyes, but there was in her little person an air of decision that was but seldom apparent there"
7141,"‘I hope you have made a right decision, Keziah,’ said Anne, with some anxiety, feeling suspicious of the red eyes"
7142,"It had been night then, with a white haze of misty moonlight and great shadows of blackness"
7143,"But now it was morning, and the red sunshine lighted up the hoar frost on the grass, already pursuing it into corners, melting away the congealed dew upon the herbs and trees"
7144,"He found her in the library, arranging with old Saymore what books were to be packed to take away, while Heathcote Mountford, looking very black and gloomy, sat at the further window pretending to read, and biting his nails furiously"
7145,"Even Anne felt a little exhilaration at the thought of windows which should look out upon the Park under the red wintry sunshine, and of all the sights and wonders that would be within reach"
7146,"’ All this time Rose turned over and over the little packet with its three red seals, playing with it as a cat plays with a mouse"
7147,for Mrs. Mountford had not tolerated any black sheep
7148,the naked branches overhead were white with rime
7149,Nothing was stirring in the wintry world about save the blue smoke from the house curling lazily far off through the anatomy of the leafless trees
7150,"It was all silent, nothing visible of the life within, except the blue smoke rising faintly through the air, which was so still"
7151,"They said little as they went along by the great terrace and the lime avenue, avoiding the flower-garden, now so bare and brown"
7152,"To see the red wintry sunshine lighting up the misty expanse of the Park, the brisk pedestrians going to and fro under the bare trees, the carriages following each other along the broad road, the coveys of pretty children and neat nursemaids, and all the flood of prosperous life that flows along, leisurely in the morning, crowding in{} the afternoons, is very pleasant to the uninitiated"
7153,"The misty distance, penetrated by the red rays of sunshine, was a kind of poem, relieved by the active novelty of the animated foreground, the busy passengers, the flood and high tide of life"
7154,The red rays made the mist brighter and brighter;
7155,"It was all very chilly when he arrived, a dampness clinging to the unoccupied house, and a white mist in all the hollows of the park"
7156,"The passages were all black as night, the windows, when he glanced out at them behind the curtains, showing nothing but a universal blackness, not even the sky or the trees"
7157,"She was in a white dress, profusely trimmed with black, and made in a fashion to which the young men were unaccustomed, the latest Parisian fashion, which they did not understand, indeed, but which roused all their English conservatism of feeling, as much as if they had understood it"
7158,"Charley seated himself in a chair by the{} table while this was going on, and when lights came he was discovered there as in a scene in a theatre, heavy and dark in his black clothes, and the pale desperation with which he was addressing himself to his task"
7159,She’s like a white marble image in a church;
7160,"He was shining from top to toe in his newest black suit, all shining, from his little varnished shoes to his bald head, and with the lights reflected in his spectacles"
7161,"She seemed to see as plainly as possible, dangling before her, with all its red seals, the packet which was to be opened on her twenty-first birthday"
7162,The red seals crackled as she took it out with trembling hands
7163,"She could lock the door of her own room, but not of Anne’s, and it would not do to scatter scraps of the red wax about Anne’s room and betray herself"
7164,"There are plenty of wicked persons who flourish like the green bay tree, and receive to all appearance no recompense for their evil ways"
7165,"All the irregular roofs—here a high-peaked gable, there an overhanging upper story, the red pediment of the Queen Anne house which was Mr. Loseby’s office and dwelling, the clustered chimneys of the almshouses—how they stood out upon the serene blueness of the sky and brilliancy of the sunshine!"
7166,"The buying and selling of the rosy-cheeked apples and green cabbages belonged to the quiet ease of living in such a softened, silent place"
7167,"To-day the windows were open, the Venetian blinds down, and there was a sort of green dimness in the room, in which Rose, dazzled by the sunshine out{} of doors, could for the moment distinguish nothing"
7168,"He was sitting in a coat made of yellow Indian grass-silk which did not accord so well as his usual shining blackness with the glistening of his little round bald head, and his eyes and spectacles"
7169,His table was covered with papers done up in bundles with all kinds of red tape and bands
7170,"The trees stood out in great tufts of yellow and crimson against the sky, which had begun to emulate their hues"
7171,"The paths were strewed, as for a religious procession, with leaves of russet and gold, and the{} low sun threw level lights over the slopes of the park, which were pathetically green with the wet and damp of approaching winter"
7172,"The bells were rung in the little church at Lilford very early, and woke Rose with a sound of congratulation, to a day which was as bright as her life, full of sunshine and freshness, the sky all blue and shining, the country gay with its autumn robes, every tree in a holiday dress"
7173,"At the upper end, at the big writing-table which was generally Anne’s throne of serious occupation, both the sisters were seated with Mr. Loseby and his blue bag"
7174,"She had on (the Curate thought) the very same dress of white cashmere, easy and graceful in its long sweeping folds, which she wore at Lady Meadowlands’ party;"
7175,She wears a little sailor hat of black straw that has long been exposed to the dust and soot of London and has seldom if ever been brushed
7176,She wears a shoddy black coat that reaches nearly to her knees and is shaped to her waist
7177,She has a brown skirt with a coarse apron
7178,"He appears in the morning light as a robust, vital, appetizing sort of man of forty or thereabouts, dressed in a professional-looking black frock-coat with a white linen collar and black silk tie"
7179,Wrap her up in brown paper till they come
7180,"If you're naughty and idle you will sleep in the back kitchen among the black beetles, and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce with a broomstick"
7181,"Only this morning, sir, you applied it to your boots, to the butter, and to the brown bread"
7182,When he opens it he is confronted with a dainty and exquisitely clean young Japanese lady in a simple blue cotton kimono printed cunningly with small white jasmine blossoms
7183,"Fairly blue with it, she was"
7184,"He is brilliantly dressed in a new fashionable frock-coat, with white waistcoat and grey trousers"
7185,"I'll lecture them blue in the face, I will, and not turn a hair"
7186,I don't mind a black eye:
7187,"If you're going to be a lady, you'll have to give up feeling neglected if the men you know don't spend half their time snivelling over you and the other half giving you black eyes"
7188,"It had prevented her from getting educated, because the only education she could have afforded was education with the Earlscourt green grocer's daughter"
7189,"and that even if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had earned one"
7190,"As for white armour, he resolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine;"
7191,"They had taken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut"
7192,"” They laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sake of the air, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and mouldy as his own armour;"
7193,"but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he said to his squire, “Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong"
7194,"what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas"
7195,"Nor were their ornaments like those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured in endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy, wherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames with all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has taught them"
7196,They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter oleander
7197,"They were going along conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap between two high mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in sheepskins of black wool, and crowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of them of yew, some of cypress"
7198,"“That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge;"
7199,"the other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of the baronies of Utrique;"
7200,and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when they perceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered over with black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning down to the very feet of their mules—for they could perceive plainly they were not horses by the easy pace at which they went
7201,"and after proceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves in a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded his beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce, they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying their appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead man’s clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance) had brought with them on their sumpter mule"
7202,"and as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where they were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in the following chapter"
7203,"“There is no need to weep,” answered Sancho, “for I will amuse your worship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you like to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after the fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and the moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you are looking forward to"
7204,"but so great was the fear that had penetrated his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by as much as the black of his nail;"
7205,"at last the princess will come to herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing them with his tears"
7206,"Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a white beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the reason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but the fifth acted as his tongue and said, “This worthy man is going to the galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on horseback"
7207,"all I say now is, that the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp;"
7208,"As well as he could make out he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs and feet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places"
7209,"As soon as he had done he made signs to them to follow him, which they did, and he led them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock"
7210,"Past its base there flowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green and luxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and forest trees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms of the spot"
7211,"Ye on the mountainside that grow, Ye green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes, Are ye aweary of the woe That this poor aching bosom crushes?"
7212,and the barber made a beard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to stick his comb
7213,"she put on him a cloth petticoat with black velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green velvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as well as the petticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba"
7214,"The curate would not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted linen cap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip of black silk, while with another he made a mask with which he concealed his beard and face very well"
7215,"He then put on his hat, which was broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and enveloping himself in his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while the barber mounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white, for it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox"
7216,"and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our neighbours and acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of my boldness was to take, almost by force, one of her fair white hands and carry it to my lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating that separated us allowed me"
7217,He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown jacket bound tight to his body with a white cloth;
7218,"he wore besides breeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on his head a brown montera;"
7219,"Dorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of some rich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a necklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an instant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich lady"
7220,"By God I will stir them up, big and little, or as best I can, and let them be ever so black I’ll turn them into white or yellow"
7221,"but the curate, who was very fertile in devices, soon hit upon a way of effecting their purpose, and with a pair of scissors he had in a case he quickly cut off Cardenio’s beard, and putting on him a grey jerkin of his own he gave him a black cloak, leaving himself in his breeches and doublet, while Cardenio’s appearance was so different from what it had been that he would not have known himself had he seen himself in a mirror"
7222,was it white wheat or brown?”
7223,"“but let your worship take care to choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don’t like the life, I may be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said;"
7224,"especially when they describe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the orange trees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead with envy and fright;"
7225,"“May I die,” said the landlord at this, “if Don Quixote or Don Devil has not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at his bed’s head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes for blood;” and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him, and there they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world"
7226,"on his head he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his left arm he had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for reasons best known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he held his unsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on all sides, uttering exclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant:"
7227,"“Don’t you see, you thief, that the blood and the fountain are only these skins here that have been stabbed and the red wine swimming all over the room?—and I wish I saw the soul of him that stabbed them swimming in hell"
7228,"“Four men,” said the landlord, “riding à la jineta, with lances and bucklers, and all with black veils, and with them there is a woman in white on a side-saddle, whose face is also veiled, and two attendants on foot"
7229,"“Like red wine, your worship had better say,” replied Sancho;"
7230,"“for I would have you know, if you don’t know it, that the dead giant is a hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me;"
7231,"The strange figure he presented filled Don Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of his deportment"
7232,"but as to the giant’s head, or at least as to the piercing of the wine-skins, and the blood being red wine, I make no mistake, as sure as there is a God;"
7233,"but they were brought to an end by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from his attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors, for he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with half-sleeves and without a collar;"
7234,"his breeches were also of blue cloth, and his cap of the same colour, and he wore yellow buskins and had a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast"
7235,"I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the terrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out that opened and shut very quickly"
7236,"and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance with the white flag of peace, the little bundle"
7237,"and I say—saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments—that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber’s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood;"
7238,"Dorothea turned red at Sancho’s words, for the truth was that her husband Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were not looking, gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned, and Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a queen of a great kingdom;"
7239,"the which shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion and the white Tobosan dove shall be linked together, having first humbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony"
7240,"The carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little;"
7241,"And so, moved by compassion, he said to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival of the provisions:"
7242,"‘Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this dread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;’ and then the knight, almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider, without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing himself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive armour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into the midst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows what his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with which the Elysian fields are not to be compared"
7243,"“The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a strange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees presents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure, while the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless birds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing branches"
7244,"Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid crystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like sifted gold and purest pearls"
7245,"here another of rustic fashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow mansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with fragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of varied aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it"
7246,"By this time the canon’s servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the sumpter mule, had returned, and making a carpet and the green grass of the meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of some trees and made their repast there, that the carter might not be deprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been already said"
7247,"” The goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him at once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents"
7248,"and he was all the more confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and discourteous thieves were carrying off by force"
7249,"” Sancho laboured in vain, for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word;"
7250,"They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised their townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart"
7251,"They came to see him consequently, and found him sitting up in bed in a green baize waistcoat and a red Toledo cap, and so withered and dried up that he looked as if he had been turned into a mummy"
7252,"which truth is so clear that I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, who was a man of lofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome though black beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression, sparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him;"
7253,"With regard to Roland, or Rotolando, or Orlando (for the histories call him by all these names), I am of opinion, and hold, that he was of middle height, broad-shouldered, rather bow-legged, swarthy-complexioned, red-bearded, with a hairy body and a severe expression of countenance, a man of few words, but very polite and well-bred"
7254,"The caballeros say they do not want to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularly squire hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings with green silk"
7255,"Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white;"
7256,"’ Well then, if he be mad, as he is, and with a madness that mostly takes one thing for another, and white for black, and black for white, as was seen when he said the windmills were giants, and the monks’ mules dromedaries, flocks of sheep armies of enemies, and much more to the same tune, it will not be very hard to make him believe that some country girl, the first I come across here, is the lady Dulcinea;"
7257,Am I to mark this day with a white stone or a black?”
7258,"“Now, may God deliver me from the devil!” said Sancho, “and can it be that your worship takes three hackneys—or whatever they’re called—as white as the driven snow, for jackasses?"
7259,"It ought to have been enough for you, ye scoundrels, to have changed the pearls of my lady’s eyes into oak galls, and her hair of purest gold into the bristles of a red ox’s tail, and in short, all her features from fair to foul, without meddling with her smell;"
7260,"though, to tell the truth, I never perceived her ugliness, but only her beauty, which was raised to the highest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip, like a moustache, with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold, and more than a palm long"
7261,"but eyes that are like pearls are rather the eyes of a sea-bream than of a lady, and I am persuaded that Dulcinea’s must be green emeralds, full and soft, with two rainbows for eyebrows;"
7262,"and he is a man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with hair turning grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black drooping moustaches;"
7263,"As they were engaged in this conversation they were overtaken by a man who was following the same road behind them, mounted on a very handsome flea-bitten mare, and dressed in a gaban of fine green cloth, with tawny velvet facings, and a montera of the same velvet"
7264,He carried a Moorish cutlass hanging from a broad green and gold baldric;
7265,"and if the man in green examined Don Quixote closely, still more closely did Don Quixote examine the man in green, who struck him as being a man of intelligence"
7266,What he in green thought of Don Quixote of La Mancha was that a man of that sort and shape he had never yet seen;
7267,"With these words Don Quixote held his peace, and, from the time he took to answer, the man in green seemed to be at a loss for a reply;"
7268,"To this, he in the green gaban replied “I, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, am a gentleman by birth, native of the village where, please God, we are going to dine to-day;"
7269,"He of the green gaban was filled with astonishment at Don Quixote’s argument, so much so that he began to abandon the notion he had taken up about his being crazy"
7270,"He of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, but could perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two or three small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carrying treasure of the King’s, and he said so to Don Quixote"
7271,"Don Quixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what it was that made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash inside his helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it he exclaimed:"
7272,"He of the green gaban would have offered resistance, but he found himself ill-matched as to arms, and did not think it prudent to come to blows with a madman, for such Don Quixote now showed himself to be in every respect;"
7273,"Sancho, however, happening to observe the signal of the white cloth, exclaimed, “May I die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts, for he is calling to us"
7274,"The cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the green gaban went theirs"
7275,"One of the students carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a portmanteau, what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of pairs of ribbed stockings;"
7276,"He also admired another that came in composed of fair young maidens, none of whom seemed to be under fourteen or over eighteen years of age, all clad in green stuff, with their locks partly braided, partly flowing loose, but all of such bright gold as to vie with the sunbeams, and over them they wore garlands of jessamine, roses, amaranth, and honeysuckle"
7277,The nymphs that followed Love bore their names written on white parchment in large letters on their backs
7278,"egad, as well as I can make out, the patena she wears rich coral, and her green Cuenca stuff is thirty-pile velvet;"
7279,"and then the white linen trimming—by my oath, but it’s satin!"
7280,"May I never have luck if they’re not gold rings, and real gold, and set with pearls as white as a curdled milk, and every one of them worth an eye of one’s head!"
7281,"but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, “Wait a little, ye, as inconsiderate as ye are hasty!” At these words all turned round, and perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames"
7282,"On his shoulders and breast he had a green satin collegiate hood, and covering his head a black Milanese bonnet, and his snow-white beard fell below his girdle"
7283,"I looked round, and through the crystal wall I saw passing through another chamber a procession of two lines of fair damsels all clad in mourning, and with white turbans of Turkish fashion on their heads"
7284,"Behind, in the rear of these, there came a lady, for so from her dignity she seemed to be, also clad in black, with a white veil so long and ample that it swept the ground"
7285,"her eyebrows met, her nose was rather flat, her mouth was large but with ruddy lips, and her teeth, of which at times she allowed a glimpse, were seen to be sparse and ill-set, though as white as peeled almonds"
7286,"for it is not right to deal with them after the fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when they are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses under the pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from which they cannot expect to be released except by death"
7287,"We’re in for a grand night!” I forgot to mention that the said Master Pedro had his left eye and nearly half his cheek covered with a patch of green taffety, showing that something ailed all that side"
7288,"Observe now how he prints a kiss upon her lips, and what a hurry she is in to spit, and wipe them with the white sleeve of her smock, and how she bewails herself, and tears her fair hair as though it were to blame for the wrong"
7289,"He descended the slope and approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags, make out the colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially one on a standard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a very life-like style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouth open and its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying;"
7290,"But again I tell thee, feel and hunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white paper"
7291,"It so happened that the next day towards sunset, on coming out of a wood, Don Quixote cast his eyes over a green meadow, and at the far end of it observed some people, and as he drew nearer saw that it was a hawking party"
7292,"Coming closer, he distinguished among them a lady of graceful mien, on a pure white palfrey or hackney caparisoned with green trappings and a silver-mounted side-saddle"
7293,"Don Quixote dressed himself, put on his baldric with his sword, threw the scarlet mantle over his shoulders, placed on his head a montera of green satin that the damsels had given him, and thus arrayed passed out into the large room, where he found the damsels drawn up in double file, the same number on each side, all with the appliances for washing the hands, which they presented to him with profuse obeisances and ceremonies"
7294,"Don Quixote finally grew calm, and dinner came to an end, and as the cloth was removed four damsels came in, one of them with a silver basin, another with a jug also of silver, a third with two fine white towels on her shoulder, and the fourth with her arms bared to the elbows, and in her white hands (for white they certainly were) a round ball of Naples soap"
7295,and more by token it says it was red wheat;
7296,"I have already said, however, that that wheat was not red wheat, nor wheat at all, but grains of orient pearl"
7297,"They presented Don Quixote with a hunting suit, and Sancho with another of the finest green cloth;"
7298,"Finding himself in this position, and that the green coat was beginning to tear, and reflecting that if the fierce animal came that way he might be able to get at him, he began to utter such cries, and call for help so earnestly, that all who heard him and did not see him felt sure he must be in the teeth of some wild beast"
7299,It was drawn by four plodding oxen all covered with black housings;
7300,he was dressed in a long robe of black buckram;
7301,"They saw advancing towards them, to the sound of this pleasing music, what they call a triumphal car, drawn by six grey mules with white linen housings, on each of which was mounted a penitent, robed also in white, with a large lighted wax taper in his hand"
7302,"The car was twice or, perhaps, three times as large as the former ones, and in front and on the sides stood twelve more penitents, all as white as snow and all with lighted tapers, a spectacle to excite fear as well as wonder;"
7303,"Beside her was a figure in a robe of state, as they call it, reaching to the feet, while the head was covered with a black veil"
7304,"O thou, the pride and pink of all that I wear The adamantine steel!"
7305,"I’m now ready to burst with grief at seeing my green coat torn, and they come to ask me to whip myself of my own free will, I having as little fancy for it as for turning cacique"
7306,"the flowers of the field, revived, raised up their heads, and the crystal waters of the brooks, murmuring over the grey and white pebbles, hastened to pay their tribute to the expectant rivers;"
7307,I send thee here a green hunting suit that my lady the duchess gave me;
7308,"for, make thy affairs public, and some will say they are white and others will say they are black"
7309,"As they marched they beat two great drums which were likewise draped in black, and beside them came the fife player, black and sombre like the others"
7310,"Over the gown, girdling or crossing his figure, he had a broad baldric which was also black, and from which hung a huge scimitar with a black scabbard and furniture"
7311,"He had his face covered with a transparent black veil, through which might be descried a very long beard as white as snow"
7312,"Following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes apparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen"
7313,"Behind them came the Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her by the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it a nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea;"
7314,"The twelve duennas and the lady came on at procession pace, their faces being covered with black veils, not transparent ones like Trifaldin’s, but so close that they allowed nothing to be seen through them"
7315,suddenly there came into the garden four wild-men all clad in green ivy bearing on their shoulders a great wooden horse
7316,"and their astonishment was increased when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on which there was the following inscription in large gold letters:"
7317,"and when the squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the white dove shall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her, and in the arms of her beloved mate;"
7318,for the mere black of the nail of my soul is dearer to me than my whole body;
7319,"The worthy gentleman was beyond measure distressed, and at that moment he would have given an ounce of silver to have had half a drachm of green silk there;"
7320,"I say green silk, because the stockings were green"
7321,"He threw over him his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet trimmed with silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with his good trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried with him, and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting for him"
7322,They then lifted up a fine white cloth covering fruit and a great variety of dishes of different sorts;
7323,"He stood up on the bed wrapped from head to foot in a yellow satin coverlet, with a cap on his head, and his face and his moustaches tied up, his face because of the scratches, and his moustaches to keep them from drooping and falling down, in which trim he looked the most extraordinary scarecrow that could be conceived"
7324,"He kept his eyes fixed on the door, and just as he was expecting to see the love-smitten and unhappy Altisidora make her appearance, he saw coming in a most venerable duenna, in a long white-bordered veil that covered and enveloped her from head to foot"
7325,"for the moment she saw his tall yellow form with the coverlet and the bandages that disfigured him, she gave a loud scream, and exclaiming, “Jesus!"
7326,"for it is impossible that a long, white-hooded spectacled duenna could stir up or excite a wanton thought in the most graceless bosom in the world"
7327,"God bless me, with what an air of dignity he used to carry my lady behind him on a stout mule as black as jet!"
7328,"” They raised two or three lanterns to her face, and by their light they distinguished the features of a woman to all appearance of the age of sixteen or a little more, with her hair gathered into a gold and green silk net, and fair as a thousand pearls"
7329,"They scanned her from head to foot, and observed that she had on red silk stockings with garters of white taffety bordered with gold and pearl;"
7330,"her breeches were of green and gold stuff, and under an open jacket or jerkin of the same she wore a doublet of the finest white and gold cloth;"
7331,her shoes were white and such as men wear;
7332,"He had nothing on but a rich petticoat and a short blue damask cloak with fine gold lace, and his head was uncovered and adorned only with its own hair, which looked like rings of gold, so bright and curly was it"
7333,"This declaration having been made, and the duke having settled in his own mind what he would do in the matter, the ladies in black withdrew, and the duchess gave orders that for the future they were not to be treated as servants of hers, but as lady adventurers who came to her house to demand justice;"
7334,"They also put down a black dainty called, they say, caviar, and made of the eggs of fish, a great thirst-wakener"
7335,"They’ll take up my bones out of this, when it is heaven’s will that I’m found, picked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple’s with them, and by that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least by such as have heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his ass, nor his ass from Sancho Panza"
7336,"In conversation of this sort the knight and squire errant were pursuing their journey, when, after they had gone a little more than half a league, they perceived some dozen men dressed like labourers stretched upon their cloaks on the grass of a green meadow eating their dinner"
7337,"They had beside them what seemed to be white sheets concealing some objects under them, standing upright or lying flat, and arranged at intervals"
7338,"While engaged in this discourse they were making their way through a wood that lay beyond the road, when suddenly, without expecting anything of the kind, Don Quixote found himself caught in some nets of green cord stretched from one tree to another;"
7339,"Well then let me tell them that if these nets, instead of being green cord, were made of the hardest diamonds, or stronger than that wherewith the jealous god of blacksmiths enmeshed Venus and Mars, I would break them as easily as if they were made of rushes or cotton threads"
7340,"Their hair, that in its golden brightness vied with the beams of the sun itself, fell loose upon their shoulders and was crowned with garlands twined with green laurel and red everlasting;"
7341,"and mounted on Rocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm and grasping his lance, he posted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from the green meadow"
7342,"take my advice, and after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green grass-mattress, and you will see that when you awake you’ll feel something better"
7343,"there was, however, but one, riding on which at a furious pace came a youth, apparently about twenty years of age, clad in green damask edged with gold and breeches and a loose frock, with a hat looped up in the Walloon fashion, tight-fitting polished boots, gilt spurs, dagger and sword, and in his hand a musketoon, and a pair of pistols at his waist"
7344,"The general, for so we shall call him, a Valencian gentleman of rank, gave him his hand and embraced him, saying, “I shall mark this day with a white stone as one of the happiest I can expect to enjoy in my lifetime, since I have seen Señor Don Quixote of La Mancha, pattern and image wherein we see contained and condensed all that is worthy in knight-errantry"
7345,"When Sancho saw so many red feet (for such he took the oars to be) moving all together, he said to himself, “It’s these that are the real chanted things, and not the ones my master talks of"
7346,"The lacquey laughed, unsheathed his gourd, unwalletted his scraps, and taking out a small loaf of bread he and Sancho seated themselves on the green grass, and in peace and good fellowship finished off the contents of the alforjas down to the bottom, so resolutely that they licked the wrapper of the letters, merely because it smelt of cheese"
7347,"for sometimes the lady Diana goes on a stroll to the antipodes, and leaves the mountains all black and the valleys in darkness"
7348,"In the middle of the court was a catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered completely by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all round it white wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver candlesticks"
7349,"She lay with her head resting upon a cushion of brocade and crowned with a garland of sweet-smelling flowers of divers sorts, her hands crossed upon her bosom, and between them a branch of yellow palm of victory"
7350,"At this moment an official crossed over, and approaching Sancho threw over him a robe of black buckram painted all over with flames of fire, and taking off his cap put upon his head a mitre such as those undergoing the sentence of the Holy Office wear;"
7351,pinch my arms with red-hot pincers;
7352,"and so, having learned where Don Quixote was from the page who brought the letter and present to Sancho’s wife, Teresa Panza, he got himself new armour and another horse, and put a white moon upon his shield, and to carry his arms he had a mule led by a peasant, not by Tom Cecial his former squire for fear he should be recognised by Sancho or Don Quixote"
7353,"Altisidora, come back from death to life as Don Quixote fancied, following up the freak of her lord and lady, entered the chamber, crowned with the garland she had worn on the catafalque and in a robe of white taffeta embroidered with gold flowers, her hair flowing loose over her shoulders, and leaning upon a staff of fine black ebony"
7354,"I’m not the woman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less die!”"
7355,"They made their way at length in among some pleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and there vacating Rocinante’s saddle and Dapple’s pack-saddle, they stretched themselves on the green grass and made their supper off Sancho’s stores, and he making a powerful and flexible whip out of Dapple’s halter and headstall retreated about twenty paces from his master among some beech trees"
7356,"They then went on, and upon the green at the entrance of the town they came upon the curate and the bachelor Samson Carrasco busy with their breviaries"
7357,"or els he will find himselfe entangled in words, as a bird in lime-twiggs;"
7358,"And this differs nothing from that, which the two men in white clothing (that is, the two Angels) said to the Apostles, that were looking upon Christ ascending (Acts"
7359,"And his rayment became shining, exceeding white as snow;"
7360,so as no Fuller on earth can white them
7361,"And looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only ,, of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow, navy-crowded seas"
7362,"Men like Schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-bye, that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well"
7363,"He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet"
7364,"the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof—an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it"
7365,"Looking through the telescope, one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field"
7366,"I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes"
7367,"My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky"
7368,"The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against the dawn"
7369,It was such a gradual movement that he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the circumference
7370,"Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated, until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so"
7371,An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger beer
7372,"The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black against the lemon yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people, perhaps"
7373,"There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty"
7374,"And then, with a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on the edge of the pit"
7375,"It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in, but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun"
7376,"The barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the burning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground"
7377,"Once a leash of thin black whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling motion"
7378,"Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns"
7379,"And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag"
7380,"This little group had in its advance dragged inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at discreet distances"
7381,"This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their dispersal"
7382,"Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical black shapes upon the black ground"
7383,"As the green smoke arose, their faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished"
7384,It was as if some invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame
7385,"The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early night"
7386,The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came out sharp and black against the western afterglow
7387,"The little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had scarcely been broken"
7388,"the three puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame"
7389,"Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred"
7390,"When I saw how deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly"
7391,"My dear wife’s sweet anxious face peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white cloth with its silver and glass table furniture—for in those days even philosophical writers had many little luxuries—the crimson-purple wine in my glass, are photographically distinct"
7392,"People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside the carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark dance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of smoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious than a heath fire was happening"
7393,"Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers—sappers, I think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf"
7394,"and, starting out upon the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it slide down into ruin"
7395,"One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it, flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window"
7396,A sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a moment
7397,"Thick streamers of black smoke shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward"
7398,When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the black smoke
7399,"Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted"
7400,The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke
7401,"From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me"
7402,"Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops and roofs black and sharp against the red"
7403,Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and showed the distant woods towards Addlestone
7404,"I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the field to my left"
7405,"Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like a rocket overhead"
7406,"It was an elusive vision—a moment of bewildering darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees, and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright"
7407,"The horse lay motionless (his neck was broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still spinning slowly"
7408,"Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal like a gigantic fisherman’s basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me"
7409,"So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in blinding highlights and dense black shadows"
7410,"Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of boots"
7411,"Nothing was burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came a red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the drenching hail"
7412,"The towers of the Oriental College and the pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red glare, the common about the sand-pits was visible"
7413,"Across the light huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro"
7414,"It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on fire—a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red reflection upon the cloud scud above"
7415,"I could not see what they were doing, nor the clear form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon"
7416,"there were a black heap and a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs"
7417,"It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set with fire"
7418,Later I saw against the light of Woking station a number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line
7419,"With a queer feeling of impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down, and stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three gigantic black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the sand-pits"
7420,"A kind of arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green flashes scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray"
7421,"Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh amid the wreckage"
7422,"It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the brightening dawn—streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished"
7423,"for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage instead of green"
7424,"Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more guns behind"
7425,"Three or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village street"
7426,“Here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey
7427,"The hood bulged, flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and glittering metal"
7428,"I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend"
7429,"When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog that at first hid the Martians altogether"
7430,"Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames"
7431,Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards me
7432,"Every minute a fresh gun came into position until, before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle"
7433,"And through the charred and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles altogether—that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common, through charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach"
7434,"They were hard at work there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs"
7435,"Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the meadows from the direction of Weybridge"
7436,"It was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight up into the heat of the afternoon"
7437,He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone
7438,"A man in a blue and white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings"
7439,On the bridge a number of loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the stream in patches
7440,"All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the pink sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices of an army of hawkers following these pioneers"
7441,He was dirty and white in the face
7442,"There was a noise of doors opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from darkness into yellow illumination"
7443,"Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of the houses grew pink with the early dawn"
7444,“The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and poisonous vapour by means of rockets
7445,"Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps"
7446,"So far as one can ascertain from the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green smoke"
7447,"The Martian who had been overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure, oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight, and apparently engaged in the repair of his support"
7448,"It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube"
7449,"At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford"
7450,"The Martians had but to advance into the line of fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a thunderous fury of battle"
7451,"But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath"
7452,"Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen"
7453,"Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the nature of this substance"
7454,"Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation, that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton"
7455,"For a day and a half he remained there, weary, starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs, green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight"
7456,"But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground"
7457,"These continued intermittently for the space of a quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow"
7458,"Then the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green meteor—as I learned afterwards, in Bushey Park"
7459,"Before the guns on the Richmond and Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the black vapour could overwhelm the gunners"
7460,"Wherever there was a possibility of guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour was discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray was brought to bear"
7461,"By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke, blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the eye could reach"
7462,"Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the necessity of flight"
7463,"By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes, and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in its sluggish advance"
7464,She turned without a word—they were both panting—and they went back to where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony
7465,"Then round the corner of the lane, from between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust"
7466,"“This’ll tike us rahnd Edgware?” asked the driver, wild-eyed, white-faced;"
7467,"My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in front of them, and veiling the white façade of a terrace beyond the road that appeared between the backs of the villas"
7468,"Mrs. Elphinstone suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up above the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky"
7469,"A great bank of dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every description"
7470,"And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to add to the confusion"
7471,"the black heads, the crowded forms, grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past, and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust"
7472,"Fighting side by side with them pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed, loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed"
7473,"Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked"
7474,"A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble, and hobbled on again;"
7475,My brother saw dimly through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge
7476,"My brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black horse came to his assistance"
7477,"There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways, and the carthorse pushed beside it"
7478,"He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all a child’s want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under the rolling wheels"
7479,"As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn, and shining with perspiration"
7480,"Miss Elphinstone was white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to call upon “George"
7481,"My brother, with the cabman’s whip marks red across his face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her"
7482,"If one could have hung that June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives, each dot a human agony of terror and physical distress"
7483,"I have set forth at length in the last chapter my brother’s account of the road through Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming of black dots appeared to one of those concerned"
7484,"Steadily, incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley, exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper"
7485,"And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river, the glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that, laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose, and taking possession of the conquered country"
7486,About one o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge
7487,"My brother, keeping watch beside the women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond the hills"
7488,"and beyond were ships of larger burden, a multitude of filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats, petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg;"
7489,"and along the blue coast across the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of boats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon"
7490,"It was the only warship in sight, but far away to the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was a dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam up and ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it"
7491,"At the same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of black smoke"
7492,"The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance, advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness"
7493,She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway between the steamboat and the Martians—a diminishing black bulk against the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast
7494,Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a canister of the black gas at the ironclad
7495,It must have driven through the iron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through paper
7496,"For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts, its ventilators and funnels spouting fire"
7497,"and when at last the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened, and nothing of the Thunder Child could be made out, nor could the third Martian be seen"
7498,"The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in the strangest way"
7499,"Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration of guns, and a form of black shadows moving"
7500,"When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had passed over it"
7501,"Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows"
7502,"In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and luggage, all covered thickly with black dust"
7503,"We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of strange and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift"
7504,"We hurried across the exposed bridge, of course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses, some many feet across"
7505,"Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once been smoke, and dead bodies—a heap near the approach to the station;"
7506,"Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian pursued them"
7507,"Here there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of this domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan, an uncooked steak, and the half of a ham"
7508,"“It can’t be midnight yet,” I said, and then came a blinding glare of vivid green light"
7509,"Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly visible in green and black, and vanished again"
7510,"Contrasting vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range"
7511,Through the aperture in the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm blue of a tranquil evening sky
7512,"The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind us, and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil across our peephole"
7513,"And speaking of the differences between the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious suggestions of the red weed"
7514,"Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint"
7515,"At any rate, the seeds which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths"
7516,"Only that known popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition with terrestrial forms"
7517,"The red creeper was quite a transitory growth, and few people have seen it growing"
7518,"For a time, however, the red weed grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance"
7519,"The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range not very different from ours except that, according to Philips, blue and violet were as black to them"
7520,"and down on the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view, emitting jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner"
7521,"This was a body resembling a milk can in its general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below"
7522,From this unseen receiver a little thread of green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air
7523,"In another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight, untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit"
7524,"The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint, but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from the aluminium-making"
7525,"The whole picture was a flickering scheme of green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely trying to the eyes"
7526,"The sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner of the pit"
7527,As the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument and the brightness of his eyes
7528,"and as this black object came down again, I saw by the green brightness that it was a man"
7529,"Except for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for the clinking of the handling-machine, quite still"
7530,It was like a black worm swaying its blind head to and fro
7531,"On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised to find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity"
7532,"For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to move aside the red plants that obscured it"
7533,"Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner, certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the skeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in the sand"
7534,"Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the mound of rubble"
7535,"When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed with abundant shady trees"
7536,"Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork, clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute their footing"
7537,"The trees near me were dead and brown, but further a network of red thread scaled the still living stems"
7538,The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless rooms
7539,A gentle breeze kept the red weed that covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying
7540,"In the direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch of garden ground unburied"
7541,"This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep, and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed"
7542,"Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow water, where meadows used to be"
7543,"At first I was surprised at this flood in a hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the tropical exuberance of the red weed"
7544,"As the water spread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of the Thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp, whose margin I explored, and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was concealed"
7545,In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread
7546,"Now by the action of natural selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power against bacterial diseases—they never succumb without a severe struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead"
7547,"I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed some fronds of red weed;"
7548,"I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little;"
7549,The red weed was less abundant;
7550,the tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper
7551,"blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the weed"
7552,That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom;
7553,"there was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality"
7554,"Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches"
7555,"His black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him"
7556,There was a red cut across the lower part of his face
7557,"These green stars—I’ve seen none these five or six days, but I’ve no doubt they’re falling somewhere every night"
7558,Fancy those brown creepers!”
7559,The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm
7560,"From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney, but we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the low parts of Lambeth flooded and red"
7561,"The red creeper swarmed up the trees about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and dead, and set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters"
7562,"laburnums, pink mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight"
7563,"Beyond Kensington dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the northward hills"
7564,"the fires near Kensington glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up and vanished in the deep blue night"
7565,"Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale, violet-purple fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze"
7566,"For a space I could not understand it, and then I knew that it must be the red weed from which this faint irradiation proceeded"
7567,"I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high in the west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead and Highgate"
7568,"The red weed was tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway;"
7569,"He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but helplessly and speechlessly drunk"
7570,"There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and it grew thicker in Fulham"
7571,"Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder, and I passed a white terrace of houses on fire;"
7572,Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon dead bodies
7573,"The black powder covered them over, and softened their outlines"
7574,"Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in the City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn, the desertion, and the stillness"
7575,"the hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement"
7576,In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder
7577,"Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its black shroud?"
7578,"I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings of the cellars of some of the houses"
7579,"I was weary after eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I found there"
7580,"A couple of hundred yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him"
7581,"A little beyond the ruins about the smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the Regent’s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation"
7582,"All about me the red weed clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness"
7583,The windows in the white houses were like the eye sockets of skulls
7584,"In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway"
7585,"I marched on recklessly towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the light grew, I saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about the hood"
7586,I hurried through the red weed that choked St
7587,slain as the red weed was being slain;
7588,"At the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine that would fight no more for ever, at the tattered red shreds of flesh that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of Primrose Hill"
7589,"Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky, and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught the light and glared with a white intensity"
7590,"Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;"
7591,"and southward, beyond the Martians, the green waves of Regent’s Park, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant mansions of the Brompton Road came out clear and little in the sunrise, the jagged ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond"
7592,"Far away and blue were the Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered like two silver rods"
7593,"But then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, how shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and that every other man still wore his dirty rags"
7594,Haggard special constables with white badges stood at the corners of every street
7595,"I saw little of the mischief wrought by the Martians until I reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the red weed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge"
7596,"At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of that grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place"
7597,"The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of red weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage"
7598,"The Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red climber"
7599,"The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and very painful to the eye"
7600,One’s gaze went with infinite relief from the scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green softness of the eastward hills
7601,"Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened bones of the horse scattered and gnawed"
7602,"Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found burial, and so came home past the College Arms"
7603,"And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid, were my cousin and my wife—my wife white and tearless"
7604,"Spectrum analysis of the black powder points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that it combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly effect upon some constituent in the blood"
7605,"None of the brown scum that drifted down the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the time, and now none is forthcoming"
7606,"Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer;"
7607,"And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last great day"
7608,"Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present time (the summer of ) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again"
7609,""" ""Then I take it for granted,"" observed Sir Walter, ""that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery"
7610,"but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything considered, she wished to remain"
7611,"could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!"
7612,"That she was coming to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the first black idea;"
7613,"and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight:"
7614,"Lord Byron's ""dark blue seas"" could not fail of being brought forward by their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible"
7615,"""The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day"
7616,"he is black at heart, hollow and black!"" Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, and in a calmer manner, she added, ""My expressions startle you"
7617,"Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present time (the summer of ) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again"
7618,"""Then I take it for granted,"" observed Sir Walter, ""that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery"

7623,"Lord Byron's ""dark blue seas"" could not fail of being brought forward by their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible"
7624,"""The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day"
7625,"he is black at heart, hollow and black!"""
7626,"for I had never heard of white men or Europeans, nor of the sea:"
7627,"Each master of a family has a large square piece of ground, surrounded with a moat or fence, or enclosed with a wall made of red earth tempered;"
7628,"we call them Oye-Eboe, which term signifies red men living at a distance"
7629,"It is perhaps something remarkable, that when our people march to the field a red flag or banner is borne before them"
7630,"I believe it was gold he worked, for it was of a lovely bright yellow colour, and was worn by the women on their wrists and ancles"
7631,"Their money consisted of little white shells, the size of the finger nail"
7632,"When I looked round the ship too and saw a large furnace or copper boiling, and a multitude of black people of every description chained together, every one of their countenances expressing dejection and sorrow, I no longer doubted of my fate;"
7633,"When I recovered a little I found some black people about me, who I believed were some of those who brought me on board, and had been receiving their pay;"
7634,"I asked them if we were not to be eaten by those white men with horrible looks, red faces, and loose hair"
7635,"but soon, to my grief, two of the white men offered me eatables;"
7636,they gave me to understand we were to be carried to these white people's country to work for them
7637,"but still I feared I should be put to death, the white people looked and acted, as I thought, in so savage a manner;"
7638,"One white man in particular I saw, when we were permitted to be on deck, flogged so unmercifully with a large rope near the foremast, that he died in consequence of it;"
7639,and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the water when they liked in order to stop the vessel
7640,"Several of the strangers also shook hands with us black people, and made motions with their hands, signifying I suppose we were to go to their country;"
7641,"and, when soon after we were all put down under the deck again, there was much dread and trembling among us, and nothing but bitter cries to be heard all the night from these apprehensions, insomuch that at last the white people got some old slaves from the land to pacify us"
7642,"when I came into the room where he was I was very much affrighted at some things I saw, and the more so as I had seen a black woman slave as I came through the house, who was cooking the dinner, and the poor creature was cruelly loaded with various kinds of iron machines;"
7643,"I was conducted on horseback by an elderly black man, (a mode of travelling which appeared very odd to me)"
7644,"and every body on board used me very kindly, quite contrary to what I had seen of any white people before;"
7645,"and I did not know what to think of these white people, though I very much feared they would kill and eat me"
7646,"Sometimes he would say to me—the black people were not good to eat, and would ask me if we did not eat people in my country"
7647,"and, as the white people did not make any offerings at any time, I thought they were angry with them:"
7648,"and from what I could understand by him of this God, and in seeing these white people did not sell one another, as we did, I was much pleased;"
7649,I was astonished at the wisdom of the white people in all things I saw;
7650,This was the first time I ever fought with a white boy;
7651,"The crew of the Royal George were turned over to her, and the flag of that gallant admiral was hoisted on board, the blue at the maintop-gallant mast head"
7652,"and, indeed, he conducted me to a black young woman, who was so like my sister, that, at first sight, I really thought it was her:"
7653,I was one day in a field belonging to a gentleman who had a black boy about my own size;
7654,they also styled me the black Christian
7655,"and they confessed they had made at one time a false bill of sale, and sold two Portuguese white men among a lot of slaves"
7656,"and, by his frugality, had saved so much money by working on shipboard, that he had got a white man to buy him a boat, unknown to his master"
7657,he was therefore obliged to send a white man along with me to those places;
7658,"And yet in Montserrat I have seen a negro man staked to the ground, and cut most shockingly, and then his ears cut off bit by bit, because he had been connected with a white woman who was a common prostitute:"
7659,"but most heinous in a black man only to gratify a passion of nature, where the temptation was offered by one of a different colour, though the most abandoned woman of her species"
7660,Nothing is more common than for the white people on this occasion to take the grass from them without paying for it;
7661,"Pray, reader, are these sons and daughters of the French planter less his children by being begotten on a black woman?"
7662,and at other times some other white people would serve him in the same manner
7663,"One day he said to me, very movingly, 'Sometimes when a white man take away my fish I go to my maser, and he get me my right;"
7664,She felt her pride alarmed at the superiority of her rival in being attended by a black servant:
7665,"""A black, who, a few days before had ran away from his master, and got himself christened, with intent to marry a white woman his fellow-servant, being taken and sent on board a ship in the Thames, took an opportunity of shooting himself through the head"
7666,"I had often heard of some wonders that were to be seen on this hill, and I went once with some white and black people to visit it"
7667,"Some of these ponds were as white as milk, some quite blue, and many others of different colours"
7668,"and the silver shoe buckles, and all the other things of that metal we had among us, were, in a little time, turned as black as lead"
7669,and tell my master I was better to him on board than any three white men he had;
7670,"but we had scarcely landed when we were met by two white men, who presently took our three bags from us"
7671,"Kitt's, a very curious imposition on human nature took place:—A white man wanted to marry in the church a free black woman that had land and slaves in Montserrat:"
7672,but the clergyman told him it was against the law of the place to marry a white and a black in the church
7673,"Our mate, and all the white sailors, left our vessel on this account, and went on board of the French ships"
7674,"but here, particularly in Charles Town, I met with buyers, white men, who imposed on me as in other places"
7675,"the white men buying them with smooth promises and fair words, giving me however but very indifferent payment"
7676,"and though, when the Sabbath came (which the negroes usually make their holiday) I was much inclined to go to public worship, I was obliged to hire some black men to help to pull a boat across the water to God in quest of this gentleman"
7677,"Immediately after, as I was trying to pass them in the market, amongst other white men, I was abused for offering to pass bad coin;"
7678,"and, not liking to see any strange negroes in his yard, he and a ruffian of a white man he had in his service beset me in an instant, and both of them struck me with the first weapons they could get hold of"
7679,"In short, the fair as well as black people immediately styled me by a new appellation, to me the most desirable in the world, which was Freeman, and at the dances I gave my Georgia superfine blue clothes made no indifferent appearance, as I thought"
7680,"There was a free black man, a carpenter, that I knew, who, for asking a gentleman that he worked for for the money he had earned, was put into gaol;"
7681,"The author, to oblige Mr. King, once more embarks for Georgia in one of his vessels—A new captain is appointed—They sail, and steer a new course—Three remarkable dreams—The vessel is shipwrecked on the Bahama bank, but the crew are preserved, principally by means of the author—He sets out from the island with the captain, in a small boat, in quest of a ship—Their distress—Meet with a wrecker—Sail for Providence—Are overtaken again by a terrible storm, and are all near perishing—Arrive at New Providence—The author, after some time, sails from thence to Georgia—Meets with another storm, and is obliged to put back and refit—Arrives at Georgia—Meets new impositions—Two white men attempt to kidnap him—Officiates as a parson at a funeral ceremony—Bids adieu to Georgia, and sails for Martinico"
7682,and they consisted of three black men and a Dutch Creole sailor;
7683,for not one of the white men did any thing to preserve their lives;
7684,"It was about a mile in circumference, with a white sandy beach running in a regular order along it"
7685,As we were digging holes in search of water there came forth some very thick and black stuff;
7686,"though, had not my heart been fixed on England, I should have stayed, as I liked the place extremely, and there were some free black people here who were very happy, and we passed our time pleasantly together, with the melodious sound of the catguts, under the lime and lemon trees"
7687,"and the same evening I went to a friend's house to lodge, whose name was Mosa, a black man"
7688,"for, one day, while I was a little way out of the town of Savannah, I was beset by two white men, who meant to play their usual tricks with me in the way of kidnapping"
7689,"Before I left Georgia a black woman, who had a child lying dead, being very tenacious of the church burial service, and not able to get any white person to perform it, applied to me for that purpose"
7690,"As she was much respected, there was a great company both of white and black people at the grave"
7691,"for I have already mentioned, that throughout the West Indies no black man's testimony is admitted, on any occasion, against any white person whatever, and therefore my own oath would have been of no use"
7692,"for if I should be compelled to submit to this degrading necessity, which every black freeman is under, of advertising himself like a slave, when he leaves an island, and which I thought a gross imposition upon any freeman, I feared I should miss that opportunity of going to Montserrat, and then I could not get to England that year"
7693,In general I believe they are fond of black people;
7694,"I was surprised to see how the Greeks are, in some measure, kept under by the Turks, as the negroes are in the West Indies by the white people"
7695,"The fat of them is very white and rich, and is excellent in puddings, for which it is much used"
7696,"A black cook, in melting some fat, overset the pan into the fire under the deck, which immediately began to blaze, and the flame went up very high under the foretop"
7697,"A white man, an islander, bought some goods of me to the amount of some pounds, and made me many fair promises as usual, but without any intention of paying me"
7698,"but on the contrary, when I asked him for my money he threatened me and another black man he had bought goods of, so that we found we were like to get more blows than payment"
7699,"Luckily for us however, this man was also indebted to three white sailors, who could not get a farthing from him;"
7700,"There was a vast number of negroes here, whom I found as usual exceedingly imposed upon by the white people, and the slaves punished as in the other islands"
7701,"The author leaves Doctor Irving and engages on board a Turkey ship—Account of a black man's being kidnapped on board and sent to the West Indies, and the author's fruitless endeavours to procure his freedom—Some account of the manner of the author's conversion to the faith of Jesus Christ"
7702,"at the same time I recommended to him a very clever black man, John Annis, as a cook"
7703,and that Pope Benedict was a black man
7704,"At last he asked me, 'How comes it that all the white men on board who can read and write, and observe the sun, and know all things, yet swear, lie, and get drunk, only excepting yourself?' I answered him, the reason was, that they did not fear God;"
7705,"for I am sorry to say that there was not one white person in our dwelling, nor any where else that I saw in different places I was at on the shore, that was better or more pious than those unenlightened Indians;"
7706,"A white family, within five miles of us, told us how the drink was made, and I and two others went before the time to the village, where the mirth was appointed to be held;"
7707,"merely because I was a free man, and could not by the law get any redress from a white person in those parts of the world"
7708,"I therefore remained silent, seeing not one white man on board who said a word on my behalf"
7709,"Among others he had a white pilot, one Stoker, whom he beat often as severely as he did some negroes he had on board"
7710,"One day especially, in his wild, wicked, and mad career, after striking me several times with different things, and once across my mouth, even with a red burning stick out of the fire, he got a barrel of gunpowder on the deck, and swore that he would blow up the vessel"
7711,"I now learned that after I had left the estate which I managed for this gentleman on the Musquito shore, during which the slaves were well fed and comfortable, a white overseer had supplied my place:"
7712,"and we went to every magistrate in Kingston (and there were nine), but they all refused to do any thing for me, and said my oath could not be admitted against a white man"
7713,"A white negro woman, that I had formerly seen in London and other parts, had married a white man, by whom she had three boys, and they were every one mulattoes, and yet they had fine light hair"
7714,"I at first refused going, and told him how I had been served on a like occasion by some white people the last voyage I went to Jamaica, when I attempted (if it were the will of God) to be the means of converting the Indian prince;"
7715,and at this very time I know a very respectable character a black priest at Cape Coast Castle
7716,"It rejoiced my heart when one of these friendly people took me to see a free-school they had erected for every denomination of black people, whose minds are cultivated here and forwarded to virtue;"
7717,"There was then in the city a select committee of gentlemen for the black poor, to some of whom I had the honour of being known;"
7718,"and as they seemed to think me qualified to superintend part of the undertaking, they asked me to go with the black poor to Africa"
7719,"Whereas you were directed, by our warrant of the th of last month, to receive into your charge from Mr. Irving the surplus provisions remaining of what was provided for the voyage, as well as the provisions for the support of the black poor, after the landing at Sierra Leone, with the cloathing, tools, and all other articles provided at government's expense;"
7720,"And for your guidance in preventing any white persons going, who are not intended to have the indulgences of being carried thither, we send you herewith a list of those recommended by the Committee for the black poor as proper persons to be permitted to embark, and acquaint you that you are not to suffer any others to go who do not produce a certificate from the committee for the black poor, of their having their permission for it"

7722,"A black bull, a ram, or a boar pig, were offerings for Neptune"
7723,The infernal and evil deities were to be appeased with black victims
7724,"the name Xanthus, “yellow,” was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar colour of its waters, still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of whose waters attracts the attention of travellers"
7725,"The daily duties are certainly scarcely more onerous and he had as chiefs, or colleagues, Xavier Charmes and Leon Dierx, Henry Roujon and Rene Billotte, but his office looked out on a beautiful melancholy garden with immense plane trees around which black circles of crows gathered in winter"
7726,"sometimes, he would wander along the coast, questioning the sailors, chatting with the ravageurs, or junk gatherers, or stretched at full length amid the irises and tansy he would lie for hours watching the frail insects that play on the surface of the stream, water spiders, or white butterflies, dragon flies, chasing each other amid the willow leaves, or frogs asleep on the lily-pads"
7727,"He took it to the white cities of the Genoese Gulf, towards the palm trees of Hyeres, or the red bay trees of Antheor"
7728,"and amid these, a sprinkling of red-breeched soldiers, the pitiful remnant of a division cut down in a great battle;"
7729,"A little later on, a black mass descended St"
7730,"The ground had been frozen hard for some time-past, and about three o'clock on Monday afternoon—large black clouds from the north shed their burden of snow uninterruptedly all through that evening and night"
7731,A thick curtain of glistening white flakes fell ceaselessly to the ground;
7732,"As he was about to fetch the second horse he noticed the motionless group of travellers, already white with snow, and said to them:"
7733,"A murky light filtered through dark, heavy clouds, which made the country more dazzlingly white by contrast, a whiteness broken sometimes by a row of tall trees spangled with hoarfrost, or by a cottage roof hooded in snow"
7734,For the past twenty years his big red beard had been on terms of intimate acquaintance with the tankards of all the republican cafes
7735,"her mouth was small, ripe, kissable, and was furnished with the tiniest of white teeth"
7736,"At last, at three o'clock, as they were in the midst of an apparently limitless plain, with not a single village in sight, Boule de Suif stooped quickly, and drew from underneath the seat a large basket covered with a white napkin"
7737,she was white as the snow without;
7738,"She turned as red as a cherry, and stammered in her wrath:"
7739,"At the end of about an hour he heard a rustling, peeped out quickly, and caught sight of Boule de Suif, looking more rotund than ever in a dressing-gown of blue cashmere trimmed with white lace"
7740,"It was a fine meerschaum, admirably colored to a black the shade of its owner's teeth, but sweet-smelling, gracefully curved, at home in its master's hand, and completing his physiognomy"
7741,"The cold, which grew more intense each day, almost froze the noses and ears of the pedestrians, their feet began to pain them so that each step was a penance, and when they reached the open country it looked so mournful and depressing in its limitless mantle of white that they all hastily retraced their steps, with bodies benumbed and hearts heavy"
7742,"“Really, you are all too green for anything!”"
7743,The next morning the snow showed dazzling white tinder a clear winter sun
7744,"while a flock of white pigeons, with pink eyes spotted in the centres with black, puffed out their white feathers and walked sedately between the legs of the six horses, picking at the steaming manure"
7745,"In one of those oval dishes, the lids of which are decorated with an earthenware hare, by way of showing that a game pie lies within, was a succulent delicacy consisting of the brown flesh of the game larded with streaks of bacon and flavored with other meats chopped fine"
7746,"He removed the shells, threw them into the straw beneath his feet, and began to devour the eggs, letting morsels of the bright yellow yolk fall in his mighty beard, where they looked like stars"
7747,"Morissot turned his head and could see toward the left, beyond the banks of the river, the formidable outline of Mont-Valerien, from whose summit arose a white puff of smoke"
7748,"Others followed, and minute by minute the mountain gave forth its deadly breath and a white puff of smoke, which rose slowly into the peaceful heaven and floated above the summit of the cliff"
7749,"A white-aproned soldier responded to the summons, and the Prussian, tossing him the catch of the two murdered men, said:"
7750,The two women watched in silence the movements of the big red beards
7751,their ample red trousers fell in folds around their ankles
7752,"Under the high, stiff shako one could just barely perceive two thin, hollow-cheeked Breton faces, with their calm, naive blue eyes"
7753,"They stood there several minutes, bending over the railing, watching the white sails, which perhaps reminded them of their home, and of the fishing smacks leaving for the open"
7754,"And the home country, so dear and so distant, would little by little gain possession of their minds, sending them back through space, to the well-known forms and noises, to the familiar scenery, with the fragrance of its green fields and sea air"
7755,"When their last crumb of bread had been eaten and the last drop of wine had been drunk, they stretched themselves out on the grass side by side, without speaking, their half-closed eyes looking away in the distance, their hands clasped as in prayer, their red-trousered legs mingling with the bright colors of the wild flowers"
7756,"He won, and so they went to a grocery to buy two sous' worth, of red and white candies"
7757,"He saw them disappear side by side, the red trousers of his friend making a scarlet spot against the white road"
7758,"He had hardly said the last word when Jean's head carried away the rest of his body, and the little blue and red soldier fell like a shot and disappeared in the water"
7759,the fields are green as far as the eye can see
7760,The brown and wrinkled skin of his neck showed big veins which disappeared behind his jaws and came out again at the temples
7761,"revolvers and swords were displayed around big, peaceful stomachs wrapped in flaming red belts;"
7762,"Five minutes later, the commandant and his subordinates, armed to the teeth, appeared on the square, just as the little Viscount de Varnetot, his legs encased in gaiters as for a hunting party, his gun on his shoulder, was coming down the other street at double-quick time, followed by his three green-coated guards, their swords at their sides and their guns swung over their shoulders"
7763,"However, the militia were arriving by degrees, each man in a different uniform, but all wearing a black cap with gold braid, the cap being the principal part of the outfit"
7764,"He would make a flag of truce, a white flag, at the sight of which the royalist heart of the mayor would perhaps rejoice"
7765,"Massarel went towards him, took the chair, placed the white bust on it, then stepping back a few steps, he addressed it in a loud voice:"
7766,"He happened to carry his hand to his stomach, and he felt, under his red belt, the butt of his revolver"
7767,The bullet made a little black hole:
7768,"Napoleon's forehead was blown away in a white powder, but his eyes, nose and pointed mustache remained intact"
7769,"At two o'clock it began to snow, and by night the ground was covered and heavy white swirls concealed objects hard by"
7770,"The snow, which was still falling, covered them with a white powder in the darkness, and as it did not melt on their uniforms, they were hardly distinguishable in the night amid the dead whiteness of the landscape"
7771,A command was given in a low tone and when the troop resumed its march it left in its wake a sort of white phantom standing in the snow
7772,"two little hands moved aside the big blue army capes and, rosy as the dawn, with two eyes that were brighter than the stars that had just faded from sight, and a smile as radiant as the morn, a dainty face appeared"
7773,"“'Clothed in a blue blouse, a white shirt, trousers, and a pair of shoes"
7774,"Between the white foam at the foot of the walls and the white snow on the sky-line the little city, dazzling against the bluish background of the nearest mountain ranges, presented to the rays of the setting sun a pyramid of red-roofed houses, whose facades were also white, but so different one from another that they seemed to be of all tints"
7775,"And the sky above the Alps was itself of a blue that was almost white, as if the snow had tinted it;"
7776,"some silvery clouds were floating just over the pale summits, and on the other side of the gulf Nice, lying close to the water, stretched like a white thread between the sea and the mountain"
7777,"“I have seen, in the Sahara, Lake Raianechergui, fifty kilometers long, shining under a moon as brilliant as our sun and breathing up toward it a white cloud, like a mist of milk"
7778,"“I have seen, in the Lipari Islands, the weird sulphur crater of the Volcanello, a giant flower which smokes and burns, an enormous yellow flower, opening out in the midst of the sea, whose stem is a volcano"
7779,"The image of the young woman with the brown eyes, the black hair, the pale skin, this fresh, handsome Southerner, who displayed her teeth in smiling, floated before the eyes of the officer as he continued his promenade, chewing his cigar instead of smoking it;"
7780,"and the image of the commanding officer, in his close-fitting coat, covered with gold lace, and his red trousers, and a little blond mustache, would pass before the eyes of Madame Parisse, when her husband, half shaven and ill-clad, short-legged and big-bellied, came home to supper in the evening"
7781,They clinked glasses drank down the brown liquor and Captain Gribois left the room
7782,"And they sat there side by side, in the dark, on the green velvet sofa, too scared to think of sleeping"
7783,"When he had read his letters and the German newspapers, which his orderly had brought him, he got up, and after throwing three or four enormous pieces of green wood on the fire, for these gentlemen were gradually cutting down the park in order to keep themselves warm, he went to the window"
7784,"He had cold, gentle blue eyes, and a scar from a swordcut, which he had received in the war with Austria;"
7785,"The captain, a short, red-faced man, was tightly belted in at the waist, his red hair was cropped quite close to his head, and in certain lights he almost looked as if he had been rubbed over with phosphorus"
7786,"They looked at the tall trees which were dripping with rain, at the broad valley which was covered with mist, and at the church spire in the distance, which rose up like a gray point in the beating rain"
7787,"The commandant's hair did not look so gray as it was in the morning, and the captain had shaved, leaving only his mustache, which made him look as if he had a streak of fire under his nose"
7788,"Eva, “the Tomato,” to Sub-lieutenant Fritz, and Rachel, the shortest of them all, a very young, dark girl, with eyes as black as ink, a Jewess, whose snub nose proved the rule which allots hooked noses to all her race, to the youngest officer, frail Count Wilhelm d'Eyrick"
7789,"Lieutenants Otto and Fritz, who were as polite as if they had been with fashionable ladies, rather intimidated their guests, but Baron von Kelweinstein beamed, made obscene remarks and seemed on fire with his crown of red hair"
7790,"Mademoiselle Fifi had taken Rachel on his knee, and, getting excited, at one moment he kissed the little black curls on her neck and at another he pinched her furiously and made her scream, for he was seized by a species of ferocity, and tormented by his desire to hurt her"
7791,"At that she got up so quickly that the glass upset, spilling the amber-colored wine on her black hair as if to baptize her, and broke into a hundred fragments, as it fell to the floor"
7792,"Prussian soldiers, in their black helmets with brass spikes, were smoking their pipes astride their chairs in front of the houses which were still left standing"
7793,"His red hair seemed to be on fire, and his long mustache, of a paler hue, stuck out on both sides of his face, which it seemed to cut in two"
7794,"the snow was still falling like a curtain, in large, white flakes, which concealed everything under a thick, frozen coverlet, a coverlet of frozen wool One might have thought that it was the end of the world"
7795,"“They looked at the thick white flakes that were coming down, and they seemed to think:"
7796,"As there was talk of wolves, she went out with a gun upon her shoulder—her son's gun, rusty and with the butt worn by the rubbing of the hand—and she was a strange sight, the tall “Sauvage,” a little bent, going with slow strides over the snow, the muzzle of the piece extending beyond the black headdress, which confined her head and imprisoned her white hair, which no one had ever seen"
7797,"They were four great fellows with fair complexion, blond beards and blue eyes, who had not grown thin in spite of the fatigue which they had endured already and who also, though in a conquered country, had remained kind and gentle"
7798,"They could be seen, all four of them, making their toilet at the well in their shirt-sleeves in the gray dawn, splashing with great swishes of water their pink-white northern skin, while La Mere Sauvage went and came, preparing their soup"
7799,"But the old woman thought always of her own son, so tall and thin, with his hooked nose and his brown eyes and his heavy mustache which made a roll of black hair upon his lip"
7800,"The beast once dead, she skinned the red body, but the sight of the blood which she was touching, and which covered her hands, and which she felt cooling and coagulating, made her tremble from head to foot, and she kept seeing her big boy cut in two, bloody, like this still palpitating animal"
7801,She reached her bony arm toward the red heap of fire which was almost out and answered with a strong voice:
7802,"” Showing the other, she added, indicating the red ruins with a bend of the head:"
7803,"I heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and found myself face to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest of a prizefighter, formidable hands projecting from turned-up sleeves, a red face, and the look of a kind man"
7804,"” I followed him into a small room with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very different to Marchas' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said:"
7805,"He got out of his armchair, opened the door, and I saw a beautiful white tablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue aprons were setting out the plates and glasses"
7806,"Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled floor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the drawing-room, I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other one by one, who came in, swaying with different movements, one inclining to the right, while the other inclined to the left"
7807,"We watched him doing it, without speaking now, for we were interested in his attractive handiwork, and seized with renewed appetite at the sight of that enormous golden-brown bird, whose limbs fell one after another into the brown gravy at the bottom of the dish"
7808,"His cheeks, his beard, his hair, his neck and his clothes seemed to have been soaked, to have been dipped in a red tub;"
7809,"they have killed the unhappy man!” The sister had opened his blouse and shirt, and was looking at a little blue hole in his chest, which was not bleeding any more"
7810,that she no longer had the right to the symbolical wreath of orange-flowers;
7811,The one in blue?'
7812,"Four women in loose white waists were passing hot, heavy irons over the linen spread out before them, from which a warm steam arose"
7813,"When we arrived at the ferry, where my boat had been moored since morning, I saw in the grass, or rather above the tall weeds of the bank, an enormous red parasol, resembling a monstrous wild poppy"
7814,"He was now forty-five, with a good crop of gray hair, rather stout, and with that melancholy look characteristic of those who have been handsome, sought after, and liked, but who are deteriorating, daily"
7815,"He got red and confused, and then, with a smile of resignation, he said:"
7816,His face was very pale and his two big white eyes looked like wafers
7817,"The white flakes which fell continuously buried him, so that his body, quite stiff and stark, disappeared under the incessant accumulation of their rapidly thickening mass, and nothing was left to indicate the place where he lay"
7818,"Now, one Sunday, on their way to mass, the farmers noticed a great flight of crows, who were whirling incessantly above the open field, and then descending like a shower of black rain at the same spot, ever going and coming"
7819,"There was a crowd of them up in the air, as if they had gathered from all corners of the horizon, and they swooped down with a great cawing into the shining snow, which they covered like black patches, and in which they kept pecking obstinately"
7820,"He had loved her, blond and slender, in these surroundings of blue ocean and spacious sky"
7821,"It's awful, I know—I am abominably ashamed, I am as red as a peony"
7822,"They were immediately shown to one of the luxurious private dining-rooms, furnished with four large arm-chairs and a red plush couch"
7823,"of men tired from office-work, with yellow faces, stooped shoulders, and with one shoulder higher than the other, in consequence of, their long hours of writing at a desk"
7824,"A short, corpulent man, with a puffy face, dressed all in black and wearing a decoration in his buttonhole, was talking to a tall, thin man, dressed in a dirty, white linen suit, the coat all unbuttoned, with a white Panama hat on his head"
7825,"He immediately left off wearing light trousers and fancy waistcoats, and wore black trousers and long coats, on which his ribbon, which was very broad, showed off better"
7826,"The doctor looked at him with pity, and glanced for a moment at his neighbor's red face, his short, thick neck, his “corporation,” as Chenet called it to himself, his two fat, flabby legs, and the apoplectic rotundity of the old official;"
7827,"and raising the white Panama hat from his head, he said with a snigger:"
7828,"and when they turned her over, they saw that she was insensible and motionless, while her skin looked more wrinkled and yellow than usual, her eyes were closed, her teeth clenched, and her thin body was stiff"
7829,"A slight white mist that floated over the opposite banks, filled their lungs with a sensation of cold, and Caravan stopped suddenly, for he was struck by that smell from the water which brought back old memories to his mind"
7830,"Her nightcap was adorned with a red bow, and was pushed rather to one side, as was the way with all the caps she wore, and presently she turned towards him and said:"
7831,"and her little gray eyes, piercing and hard, fixed themselves now on one and now on the other, and they were so full of meaning that the children became frightened"
7832,"A parcel was brought in, which he began to open carelessly, and the mourning announcements with black borders appeared unexpectedly"
7833,"Immediately we fixed our glances on him, and we saw, yes, monsieur, we saw distinctly, both of us, something white pass across the bed, fall on the carpet, and vanish under an armchair"
7834,"I followed his glance, and saw on the ground, under the armchair by the side of the bed, standing out white on the dark carpet, and open as if to bite, Schopenhauer's set of artificial teeth"
7835,"The sun rose at length in front of us, bright red on the plane of the horizon, and in proportion as it ascended, growing clearer from minute to minute, the country seemed to awake, to smile, to shake itself like a young girl leaving her bed in her white robe of vapor"
7836,"Leon Chenal, an old painter, who had once been very handsome, very strong, very proud of his physique and very popular with women, took his long white beard in his hand and smiled"
7837,"I have recollections of coarse gray cloth covering supple peasant skin and regrets for simple, frank kisses, more delicate in their unaffected sincerity than the subtle favors of charming and distinguished women"
7838,"“You are gay on the hills, melancholy on the edge of ponds, inspired when the sun is setting in an ocean of blood-red clouds and casts red reflections or the river"
7839,"And, singing lustily, I walked with long strides, looking sometimes at the slow circling flight of a gull with its white curved wings outlined on the blue sky, sometimes at the brown sails of a fishing bark on the green sea"
7840,"The old woman was making a chicken fricassee for dinner in the large fireplace in which hung the iron pot, black with smoke"
7841,"“My place was set outside the door, and I was beginning to gnaw the lean limbs of the Normandy chicken, to drink the clear cider and to munch the hunk of white bread, which was four days old but excellent"
7842,"She was very thin, very tall, so tightly enveloped in a red Scotch plaid shawl that one might have supposed she had no arms, if one had not seen a long hand appear just above the hips, holding a white tourist umbrella"
7843,"Her face was like that of a mummy, surrounded with curls of gray hair, which tossed about at every step she took and made me think, I know not why, of a pickled herring in curl papers"
7844,"Having discovered something red through the leaves, I brushed aside the branches, and Miss Harriet at once rose to her feet, confused at having been found thus, fixing on me terrified eyes like those of an owl surprised in open day"
7845,"I was happy in this sequestered farm, far removed from everything, but in touch with the earth, the good, beautiful, green earth"
7846,"The whole right side of my canvas represented a rock, an enormous rock, covered with sea-wrack, brown, yellow and red, across which the sun poured like a stream of oil"
7847,"“On the left was the sea, not the blue sea, the slate-colored sea, but a sea of jade, greenish, milky and solid beneath the deep-colored sky"
7848,"The red sun globe sank slowly lower and lower and presently touched the water just behind the motionless vessel, which, in its dazzling effulgence, looked as though framed in a flame of fire"
7849,"“She remained standing as I had often before seen her, perched on the cliff, her face as red as her shawl"
7850,"Her face would be red, that English red which is denied to the people of all other countries;"
7851,I perceived indistinctly a white object
7852,When I did so the yellow flame danced on the layers of stone and gradually became clearer
7853,"The lantern rested on a black-and-white indistinct mass, singular, incomprehensible"
7854,When they saw issuing from the hole the black slippers and white stockings of the drowned person they disappeared
7855,"The head was shocking to look at, being bruised and lacerated, and the long gray hair, out of curl forevermore, hanging down tangled and disordered"
7856,"then a red ray streamed in on the bed, making a bar of light across the coverlet and across her hands"
7857,"His blue blouse, fastened round his waist by a black leather belt, moved in a quick, regular fashion above the green hedge of willow trees, and his stout stick of holly kept time with his steady tread"
7858,"Mederic slackened his pace, took off his black cap adorned with red lace and wiped his forehead, for it was by this time hot in the meadows, though it was not yet eight o'clock in the morning"
7859,"It was a big square house of gray stone, very old, and had stood many a siege in former days, and at the end of it was a huge tower, twenty metres high, rising out of the water"
7860,"He was a large, tall man, heavy and red-faced, strong as an ox, and was greatly liked in the district, although of an excessively violent disposition"
7861,"Farther on the outlying trees of the wood rose skyward, while at the left, beyond the Brindille, which at that spot widened into a pond, could be seen long meadows, an entirely green flat sweep of country, intersected by trenches and hedges of pollard willows"
7862,"Drops of water flowed down his temples over his ears, which were always purple, over his strong red neck, and made their way, one after the other, under his white shirt collar"
7863,Far ahead of them under the trees they saw something white on which the sun gleamed down through the branches
7864,"A big blue fly was walking over the body with his lively, jerky movements"
7865,A woman in a cap and blue apron was running toward them under the trees
7866,"When she saw that frightful countenance, black and distorted, she rose to her feet with a shudder, then sinking to the ground, face downward, she pressed her face against the ground and uttered frightful, continuous screams on the thick moss"
7867,One could see her bony ankles and her dried-up calves covered with coarse blue stockings shaking horribly
7868,"Two gendarmes appeared in the distance, advancing at a rapid trot, escorting their captain and a little gentleman with red whiskers, who was bobbing up and down like a monkey on a big white mare"
7869,"And they all directed their steps toward the house, whose gray front, with the large tower built on the edge of the Brindille, could be seen through the branches"
7870,Renardet covered his chin with a white lather while he looked at himself in the glass
7871,"Sometimes, when a gust of wind swept over the tree tops, the slow, continuous rain suddenly grew heavier and became a rough storm that covered the moss with a thick yellow carpet that made a kind of creaking sound beneath one's feet"
7872,"The Brindille, swollen by the storms, rushed on more quickly, yellow and angry, between its dry banks, bordered by two thin, bare, willow hedges"
7873,"Every day, at sunset, he came out of his house, descended the front steps slowly and entered the wood in a dreamy fashion, with his hands in his pockets, and paced over the damp soft moss, while a legion of rooks from all the neighboring haunts came thither to rest in the tall trees and then flew off like a black cloud uttering loud, discordant cries"
7874,"It was as red as usual, a little redder perhaps"
7875,"All was black outside, and he breathed with the joy of a man whose life has just been saved"
7876,"All was black as before, and he leaned on his elbow to try to distinguish the window which had still for him an unconquerable attraction"
7877,"Then, as soon as a white streak of light on the ceiling announced the approaching day, he felt himself free, alone at last, alone in his room;"
7878,"and when the man in the blue blouse had gone away, he would cast himself head foremost on the rocks on which the foundations rested, He would take care to be seen first by the workmen who had cut down his wood"
7879,"Then he descended with light steps, hurried toward the little white box fastened to the outside wall in the corner of the farmhouse, and when he had thrown into it this letter, which made his hand tremble, he came back quickly, drew the bolts of the great door and climbed up to his tower to wait for the passing of the postman, who was to bear away his death sentence"
7880,"His glance travelled across the meadows, and he perceived a blue spot in the path which wound alongside the Brindille"
7881,"The mayor's cheeks were purple, his eyes were anxious and sunken, with black circles round them, his hair was unbrushed, his beard untrimmed, his necktie unfastened"
7882,"The Brindille surrounded this rock, and over its clear, calm waters could be seen a long red thread of mingled brains and blood"
7883,In the dawning light of day the plaster houses began to appear like white spots
7884,"He took up the oars again, and once more the boat disappeared in the heavy mist, which was now turned snowy white in the pink-tinted sky"
7885,"Labouise, in a few strokes, touched the beach, and his companion, jumping to the ground, picked up a little gray rabbit, not yet dead"
7886,The last of the morning mist had disappeared and the large summer sun was climbing in the blue sky
7887,His whole red face was grinning with joy
7888,The night was perfectly black when they reached the wine shop of old man Jules
7889,“Perhaps you've not nothing but gray ones?”
7890,"A brown vapor arose making distant objects look still farther away and giving them a dismal, weird appearance"
7891,"He was a short, flaxen blond, with calm, clear, gray eyes"
7892,"He was dressed in a gray suit, and wore a soft, black, wide-brimmed, high-crowned felt hat, narrow at the top like a chimney pot, a hat which hardly any one except an Auvergnat would wear, and which reminded one of a charcoal burner"
7893,"Dressed like that, the doctor had the appearance of an old young man, with his spare body under his thin coat, and his large head covered with white hair"
7894,"yes, a fair, stout, vigorous Venus, with large, bright, vacant eyes, which were as blue as the flowers of the flax plant;"
7895,"Behind it a green, wooded plain studded with towns and villages, and bathed in a soft blue haze, extended until it was lost in the distance"
7896,"I saw nothing except a gray felt hat, cocked over one ear above a pair of broad shoulders, driving off in a cloud of dust"
7897,An old priest was standing there—an old priest with white hair
7898,"the first was small and stout, with short arms, short legs, and a round head with a red pimply face, planted directly on his trunk, which was also round and short, and with apparently no neck"
7899,"A blue blouse, as long as a shirt, hung down to his knees, and his yellow hair, which was scanty and plastered down on his head, gave his face a worn-out, dirty look, a dilapidated look that was frightful"
7900,She looked as tall as a flag pole with her cap which looked like a white skull cap
7901,"And, bear in mind, my fair niece, that I am no longer pretty, like you, but old and white-haired"
7902,"When he saw Berthe Lannis in the distance, on the long yellow stretch of sand, he would tingle to the roots of his hair"
7903,"Powerless to lift her head, she held out her white lips in an appeal for a kiss"
7904,"Under the grass, which had been cropped close by the cows, the earth soaked by recent rains, was soft and sank in under the feet with a soggy noise, and the apple trees, loaded with apples, were dropping their pale green fruit in the dark green grass"
7905,"When he got near the farm a yellow cur, tied at the foot of an enormous pear tree, beside a barrel which served as his kennel, began at first to wag his tail and then to bark for joy"
7906,"A gray skirt, too short, fell to the middle of her legs, which were encased in blue stockings"
7907,"The white cap, turned yellow, covered a few hairs which were plastered to the scalp, and her brown, thin, ugly, toothless face had that wild, animal expression which is often to be found on the faces of the peasants"
7908,"The big beams, turned brown with age and smoke, crossed the room from one side to the other, supporting the thin floor of the garret, where an army of rats ran about day and night"
7909,"The moist, lumpy earthen floor looked greasy, and, at the back of the room, the bed made an indistinct white spot"
7910,"Through his open mouth came his harsh, rattling breath, and the gray linen sheet rose and fell with each respiration"
7911,"Finally she made a big, round, yellow-white ball, which she placed on the corner of the table"
7912,"“This young scapegrace was long and lanky, with yellow hair, so light that it resembled the fluff of a plucked chicken, so thin that he seemed bald"
7913,His big gray mustache seemed almost ready to drop from his lips
7914,"and an immense red jet jumped up into the air, spreading like a stream of water and sprinkling a shower of sparks around the hut"
7915,"She looked at the black clay walls, the rafters that were blackened with smoke and from which hung spiders' webs, smoked herrings and strings of onions, and then she sat down, rather overcome by the stale odor from the earthen floor, on which so many things had been continually spilled and which the heat brought out"
7916,"The tall grass, amid which the tall yellow dandelions rose up like streaks of yellow light, was of a vivid, fresh spring green"
7917,"The apple trees cast their shade all round them, and the thatched roofs, on which grew blue and yellow irises, with their sword-like leaves, steamed as if the moisture of the stables and barns were coming through the straw"
7918,"Close to it, in a ditch, there was a large patch of violets, whose fragrance was spread abroad, while beyond the slope the open country could be seen, where grain was growing, with clumps of trees in places, and groups of laborers here and there, who looked as small as dolls, and white horses like toys, who were drawing a child's cart, driven by a man as tall as one's finger"
7919,"She had fat, red cheeks, a full bust beneath her cotton jacket;"
7920,"thick, red lips;"
7921,"and when the sun rose in the purple sky, she stopped, for her swollen feet refused to go any farther;"
7922,"She was in the water up to her thighs, and she was just about to throw her self in when sharp, pricking pains in her ankles made her jump back, and she uttered a cry of despair, for, from her knees to the tips of her feet, long black leeches were sucking her lifeblood, and were swelling as they adhered to her flesh"
7923,"The man got as red as a poppy, and stammered out in a rage:"
7924,"And he angrily mentioned all the young fellows in the neighborhood, while she denied that he had hit upon the right one, and every moment wiped her eyes with the corner of her blue apron"
7925,"She thought she had got rid of him altogether and spent the rest of the day almost tranquilly, but was as exhausted as if she had been turning the thrashing machine all day in the place of the old white horse, and she went to bed as soon as she could and fell asleep immediately"
7926,"The Jean Guiton passed over it, rolling a little from habit, dividing the smooth, dark blue water and leaving behind a few waves, a little splashing, a slight swell, which soon calmed down"
7927,"“After breakfast I climbed across a little promontory, and then, as the tide was rapidly falling, I started out across the sands toward a kind of black rock which I could just perceive above the surface of the water, out a considerable distance"
7928,“I walked quickly over the yellow plain
7929,"“It seemed fairly to rise out of the ground, and on that great, flat, yellow stretch of sand assumed wonderful proportions"
7930,"The bow had entered deep into this soft, treacherous beach, while the stern, high in air, seemed to cast at heaven, like a cry of despairing appeal, the two white words on the black planking, Marie Joseph"
7931,"They all, with their exquisite freshness, make you think of the delicate colors of pink sea-shells and of shining pearls hidden in the unknown depths of the ocean"
7932,"“They had seated themselves side by side on a projecting beam, and the four sketch-books on the eight knees were being rapidly covered with little black lines which were intended to represent the half-opened hulk of the Marie Joseph"
7933,"The father was long and thin, with a red face framed in white whiskers, and looking like a living sandwich, a piece of ham carved like a face between two wads of hair"
7934,"“She had such a droll way of speaking, of laughing, of understanding and of not understanding, of raising her eyes to ask a question (eyes blue as the deep ocean), of stopping her drawing a moment to make a guess at what you meant, of returning once more to work, of saying 'yes' or 'no'—that I could have listened and looked indefinitely"
7935,"Now the sea broke a little, and I saw in the darkness white lines appearing and disappearing, lines of foam, while each wave struck the Marie Joseph and shook her with a short quiver which went to our hearts"
7936,"“Down there, before and behind us, to the left and right, lighthouses were shining along the shore—lighthouses white, yellow and red, revolving like the enormous eyes of giants who were watching us, waiting eagerly for us to disappear"
7937,"Then he said something in English, and suddenly he and his daughters began to sing 'God Save the Queen,' which rose through the black and silent air and vanished into space"
7938,her yellow hair
7939,"He killed his pig each year on Monday in Holy Week in order to have enough black pudding to last till Easter, and when the priest passed by, he always said by way of a joke:"
7940,"The carpenter, so disturbed that he had not two ideas in his head, watched him as he put on the white vestment with its pleated folds"
7941,"” He looked at the little gray houses, the occasional pedestrians, the empty stores, and he murmured:"
7942,"Inside the cafe, five or six men, semi-gentlemen, and not noisy, were drinking and chatting quietly, leaning their elbows on the small tables, while two billiard players walked round the green baize, where the balls were hitting each other as they rolled"
7943,"She was very stout, and wore a green silk dress with low neck and short sleeves, allowing her red neck, covered with powder, to escape as a huge flower might from its corolla"
7944,"He had not finished his sentence when the door opened, and in walked Padoie dressed in a black suit"
7945,and she thought of delicious dishes served on marvellous plates and of the whispered gallantries to which you listen with a sphinxlike smile while you are eating the pink meat of a trout or the wings of a quail
7946,"Suddenly she discovered, in a black satin box, a superb diamond necklace, and her heart throbbed with an immoderate desire"
7947,"and, frightened by the trouble yet to come, by the black misery that was about to fall upon him, by the prospect of all the physical privations and moral tortures that he was to suffer, he went to get the new necklace, laying upon the jeweler's counter thirty-six thousand francs"
7948,"With frowsy hair, skirts askew and red hands, she talked loud while washing the floor with great swishes of water"
7949,"He was a tall, thin man with white whiskers, the manners of a beadle and majestic gestures"
7950,"“Sitting, almost lying, in a large armchair, his legs wrapped in blankets, his hands, his long, white hands, over the arms of the chair, he was waiting for death with the dignity of a patriarch"
7951,"His white beard fell on his chest, and his hair, which was also white, mingled with it on his cheeks"
7952,"In their petticoats and morning wrappers, with bare arms, with coal black hair twisted in a knot on the nape of their neck, with embroidered, Oriental slippers, which showed their ankles and silk stockings, they looked like the figures in some symbolical painting, by the side of the dying man"
7953,"Between the easy-chair and the bed, there was a table covered with a white cloth, on which two plates, two glasses, two forks and two knives, were waiting for the cheese omelette which had been ordered some time before of Melanie"
7954,"“By his ridiculous long coat, his long English shoes, his manners of a tutor out of a position, his high collar, white necktie and straight hair, his humble face of a false priest of a bastard religion, I immediately recognized the first as a Protestant minister"
7955,"The balloon was lying in the courtyard and had the appearance of a cake made of yellow cloth, flattened on the ground under a rope"
7956,"Suddenly the people began to stand back, for the gas was beginning to enter into the balloon through a long tube of yellow cloth, which lay on the soil, swelling and undulating like an enormous worm"
7957,"Paris spreads out beneath us, a dark bluish patch, cut by its streets, from which rise, here and there, domes, towers, steeples, then around it the plain, the country, traversed by long roads, thin and white, amidst green fields of a tender or dark green, and woods almost black"
7958,"The fusing material bubbles, sparkles, throws out blue, red, yellow, green sparks, reflections from giant diamonds, rubies, emeralds, turquoises, sapphires, topazes"
7959,"We are already out of sight of the town, and we see Roubaix to the right, then some well-cultivated, rectangular fields, of different colors according to the crops, some yellow, some gray or brown"
7960,"But the clouds are gathering behind us, hiding the moon, whereas toward the east the sky is growing lighter, becoming a clear blue tinged with red"
7961,"The rope to the escape-valve, which had been religiously enclosed in a little white bag and placed in sight of all so that no one would touch it, is unrolled, and M"
7962,"The sun beats down on the shores, on the multicolored parasols, on the blue-green sea;"
7963,"And I finally remembered what I had been, finally saw in my mind's eye my brown mustache, my black hair and the youthful expression of my face"
7964,"People talked of a colossal wolf with gray fur, almost white, who had eaten two children, gnawed off a woman's arm, strangled all the watch dogs in the district, and even come without fear into the farmyards"
7965,“Look how red the sun is
7966,"He followed it through the copses, the ravines, and the tall trees, traversing woods which he no longer recognized, his eyes fixed on the white speck which fled before him through the night"
7967,"The two men and the dog remain till the spring in their snowy prison, with nothing before their eyes except the immense white slopes of the Balmhorn, surrounded by light, glistening summits, and are shut in, blocked up and buried by the snow which rises around them and which envelops, binds and crushes the little house, which lies piled on the roof, covering the windows and blocking up the door"
7968,"They soon came in sight of the inn, which was, however, scarcely visible, so small did it look, a black speck at the foot of that enormous billow of snow, and when they opened the door Sam, the great curly dog, began to romp round them"
7969,Hauser's little daughter was there now in one of those gray-colored houses
7970,"A moving, deep and light cloud of white spray was falling on them noiselessly and was by degrees burying them under a thick, heavy coverlet of foam"
7971,"Loeche was now also covered by the snow and the houses could scarcely be distinguished, covered as they were by that white cloak"
7972,"He went along with a mountaineer's long strides, striking the snow, which was as hard as a rock, with his iron-pointed stick, and with his piercing eyes he looked for the little black, moving speck in the distance, on that enormous, white expanse"
7973,"The sun had sunk yonder behind the mountain tops, which were still purple with the reflection from the sky, but the depths of the valley were becoming gray, and suddenly the young man felt frightened"
7974,"It was quite night now, that wan, livid night of the mountains, lighted by a thin, yellow crescent moon, just disappearing behind the mountain tops"
7975,"By degrees the highest distant summits assumed a delicate, pink flesh color, and the red sun appeared behind the ponderous giants of the Bernese Alps"
7976,"And the dog, who appeared to be going mad like his master, rushed to the door, scratched it with his claws and gnawed it with his long white teeth, while the young man, with his head thrown back drank the brandy in draughts, as if it had been cold water, so that it might by and by send his thoughts, his frantic terror, and his memory to sleep again"
7977,"The chestnut trees were lighted up by its yellow rays, and the three fountains before the lofty porch of the church had the appearance of liquid silver"
7978,"She had on a pink teagown trimmed with white lace, and her fair head, her white neck and her plump hands stood out from that coquettish and perfumed dress as though it were a sea shell edged with foam"
7979,"Then, awaking, he raised himself on the red velvet seat, straightened his waistcoat, pulled down his cuffs, and took up the newspapers again, though he had already seen them in the morning, and read them all through again, from beginning to end"
7980,"The immense plain spread out before him vast as the sea, green and studded with large villages, almost as populous as towns"
7981,"His wife had grown quite white and very stout, an elderly, serious, respectable lady, and she held her head forward as she ate for fear of spotting her dress, although she had a table napkin tucked under her chin"
7982,"He wore a high hat, a white waistcoat, and a monocle, because it looked swell, no doubt"
7983,"He might have been taken for a retired diplomat, for he looked a man of great importance, with his soft white whiskers, the tips of which touched his coat collar"
7984,"They looked very much alike, having always worn their hair in Madonna bands, and loud red French cashmere shawls"
7985,Cimme observed the two green birds called love-birds
7986,"Their faces were gilded, their black hats and clothes took on purple tints, the patent leather of their shoes cast bright reflections on the asphalt of the sidewalk"
7987,"As soon as he reached their table he fixed his gleaming and delighted eyes upon them and the corners of his mouth expanded to his ears, showing his dazzling white teeth like a crescent moon in a black sky"
7988,I looked with pity at those poor negroes shivering beneath this white frozen shower
7989,"“I went towards the exercising ground, where we were all to meet, when I was dumfounded at the sight of a gigantic negro dressed in white duck and wearing a straw hat"
7990,I shivered at sight of this negro in white duck
7991,"that of Gautier, of Murger, on which I saw the other day a simple, paltry wreath of immortelles, yellow immortelles, brought thither by whom?"
7992,"Poor dear, she was so dainty, so loving and so white and fresh—and now—if one should open the grave—"
7993,"She leaned her forehead on it, and her veil spreading around her, covered the white corners of the beloved tomb, like a fresh token of mourning"
7994,"When she reappeared she was dressed in half-mourning, charming, dainty and slender in a very simple gray dress"
7995,"but beneath this one could see a large, calm brow, cut by two deep lines, two wrinkles of long sadness, then two blue eyes, large and tender, so timid, so bashful, so humble, two beautiful eyes which had kept the expression of naive wonder of a young girl, of youthful sensations, and also of sorrow, which had softened without spoiling them"
7996,the queen drinks!” She almost turned purple and choked
7997,"The pines were bending under this heavy, white garment, and looked like white pyramids or enormous sugar cones, and through the gray curtains of small hurrying flakes could be seen the lighter bushes which stood out pale in the shadow"
7998,"he was a big black shepherd's dog with long hair and a wolf's head, standing just within the gleam of light cast by our lantern on the snow"
7999,"“I can assure you that our return to the diningroom was amusing, with this baby now awake and looking round her at these people and these lights with her vague blue questioning eyes"
8000,"A little red in the face, his voice thick, he was talking away to himself now, lost in his memories, gently drifting through the old scenes and events which awoke in his mind, just as we walk through old family gardens where we were brought up and where each tree, each walk, each hedge reminds us of some occurrence"
8001,"then he appeared, half white and half red, his forehead, nose, cheeks and chin covered with chalk, and his eyes swollen, still full of tears"
8002,"A fine mist, a white haze through which the moonbeams passed, silvering it and making it gleam, hung around and above the mountains, covering all the tortuous course of the water with a kind of light and transparent cotton"
8003,"I glanced round to find a place that was not too crowded, and went and sat down by the side of a man who seemed to me to be old, and who was smoking a two-sous clay pipe, which was as black as coal"
8004,"The frayed cuffs were perfectly black at the edges, as were his nails"
8005,"Immediately a man with a white apron appeared, carrying two “bocks,” which he set down, foaming, on the table, spilling some of the yellow liquid on the sandy floor in his haste"
8006,"You remember that large gray building, in the middle of a great park, and the long avenues of oaks which opened to the four points of the compass"
8007,"The Abbe Mauduit lifted two of the children on his knees, passing his long arms clad in black round their necks, and kissing them tenderly on the forehead as he drew their heads toward him as a father might"
8008,"He was a tall old man with white hair, and for the last twenty years had been pastor of the parish of Saint-Antoine-du-Rocher"
8009,"He was a species of red spaniel, very lean, with long curly ears"
8010,"Its four horses were going at a gallop, with its yellow body, and its imperial with the black leather hood"
8011,"At last one morning she went out very early, and returned about eight o'clock bearing in her hands an enormous bouquet of white roses"
8012,"At last he stopped before a white marble slab, to which he pointed without a word"
8013,One morning on waking I saw from my window the blue sky glowing in the sun above the neighboring houses
8014,"Well, from my office I could see a small bit of blue sky and the swallows, and I felt inclined to dance among my portfolios"
8015,"Under the foliage, which was still rather scanty, the tall, thick, bright green grass was inundated by the sun, and the air was full of insects that were also making love to one another, and birds were singing in all directions"
8016,"He had put on evening dress, a black coat and white tie, which he concealed under his overcoat with the collar turned up"
8017,"Then, he took off his overcoat, so that his dress suit and his white tie could be seen"
8018,"Two young men entered, in red vests and with peaked beards, in the fashion of Henry III"
8019,He also paid for the drinks of the young fellows in red velvet;
8020,"That spacious thoroughfare literally swarmed with vehicles of every kind, and on the sidewalks the pedestrians were so numerous that they looked like two indeterminate black ribbons unfurling their length from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde"
8021,"An old gentleman with a white mustache, wearing a large round decoration, seemed particularly exasperated"
8022,"About half-past five one afternoon at the end of June when the sun was shining warm and bright into the large courtyard, a very elegant victoria with two beautiful black horses drew up in front of the mansion"
8023,"The countess was very beautiful, graceful and distinguished looking, with her long oval face, her complexion like yellow ivory, her large gray eyes and her black hair;"
8024,"That immense monument, at the end of the long avenue, raised its colossal arch against the red sky and the sun seemed to be descending on it, showering fiery dust on it from the sky"
8025,He had grown red with surprise and anger and he growled between his closed teeth:
8026,"He was a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a big red beard, a handsome man, a nobleman, a man of the world, who passed as a perfect husband and an excellent father, and now, for the first time since they had started, she turned toward him and looked him full in the face:"
8027,"” In the stalls the men were standing up, with their hats on, their waistcoats cut very low so as to show a large amount of white shirt front, in which gold and jewelled studs glistened, and were looking at the boxes full of ladies in low dresses covered with diamonds and pearls, who were expanding like flowers in that illuminated hothouse, where the beauty of their faces and the whiteness of their shoulders seemed to bloom in order to be gazed at, amid the sound of the music and of human voices"
8028,"Her pale complexion, of an ivory tint, gave her the appearance of a statue, while a small diamond coronet glistened on her black hair like a streak of light"
8029,"He looked her full in the face, and how beautiful she was, with her gray eyes, like the cold sky"
8030,"She was a little brunette, one of those girls whose eyes are so dark that they look like black spots, on a complexion like ivory"
8031,"She had suddenly become as red as a poppy, and said no more"
8032,"The air, the heat, the weak white wine and the sensation of being so close together made them silent;"
8033,It was a purple wood!
8034,"” But now her cheeks were red and her eyes hollow, and, as soon as they got to the railway station in Paris, she left him without even saying good-by"
8035,"He was tall, serious and rather stout, and wore a black frock coat, and pointed to a chair with his hand"
8036,"It was close on Holy Week, and my uncle made up his mind to give a dinner on Good Friday, a real dinner, with his favorite chitterlings and black puddings"
8037,and I saw the black cassock disappear within that stronghold of Free Thought
8038,"“A footman in black livery received us and ushered us into a quiet little parlor, furnished with taste, where we waited for several minutes"
8039,"“It was a kind of religious boudoir where a silver lamp was burning before the Crucifix, my Crucifix, on a background of black velvet"
8040,"“I was, at that time, a judge at Ajaccio, a little white city on the edge of a bay which is surrounded by high mountains"
8041,"“He was a big man, with red hair and beard, very tall, very broad, a kind of calm and polite Hercules"
8042,"“His parlor was draped in black, black silk embroidered in gold"
8043,"Big yellow flowers, as brilliant as fire, were worked on the dark material"
8044,A black object stood out against a square of red velvet
8045,"Not the clean white hand of a skeleton, but a dried black hand, with yellow nails, the muscles exposed and traces of old blood on the bones, which were cut off as clean as though it had been chopped off with an axe, near the middle of the forearm"
8046,The walls of the cell were bare and white washed
8047,"He was very thin, with hollow cheeks and hair almost white, which one guessed might have turned gray in a few months"
8048,"A panel slid back and I saw, spread out on a piece of black velvet, a magnificent tress of hair"
8049,"Dreamers maintain that the sea hides in its bosom vast tracts of blue where those who are drowned roam among the big fishes, amid strange forests and crystal grottoes"
8050,The river has only black depths where one rots in the slime
8051,"The river had slowly become enveloped in a thick white fog which lay close to the water, so that when I stood up I could see neither the river, nor my feet, nor my boat;"
8052,"but could perceive only the tops of the reeds, and farther off in the distance the plain, lying white in the moonlight, with big black patches rising up from it towards the sky, which were formed by groups of Italian poplars"
8053,and it seemed as if I would feel myself dragged down by the feet to the bottom of these black waters
8054,One saw nothing but the river gleaming with light between these two white mountains;
8055,At length we perceived a black mass and we drew it on board
8056,"And a servant, who looked like an old soldier, climbed in, carrying in his arms a stack of bundles wrapped in black and yellow papers and carefully tied;"
8057,"His full face, which was already red from the oversupply of blood, turned crimson"
8058,"He had worked all day in the yellow light of a small jet of gas, far in the back of the store, on a narrow court, as deep as a well"
8059,"Now, every evening before leaving, he would look at his white mustache and bald head in the same mirror"
8060,"He reached the boulevards, where people were streaming along under the green trees"
8061,Suddenly the young woman raised her eyes and saw something brown in the branches
8062,"Madame Maramballe was already slumbering under her white parasol, the point of which sometimes grazed along the man's impassive face"
8063,"He sat down and with a proud and familiar gesture he took his beautiful white beard in his hand, and, closing his, fingers over it, ran them down to the point, which he held for a minute at the pit of his stomach, as if once more to verify the length of this growth"
8064,"The old lady, who had a sweet face, with a snowy line of curly white hair between her forehead and her bonnet, turned around in her chair and observed her servant with a surprised look, exclaiming:"
8065,"She, the mistress of the house, was an old lady with white hair, but one of those old ladies whose unwrinkled skin is as smooth as the finest paper, and scented, impregnated with perfume, with the delicate essences which she had used in her bath for so many years"
8066,"and, resting on the cushions, she stretched herself out at full length, with her head on my shoulder, and her dress pulled up a little so as to show her red stockings, which the firelight made look still brighter"
8067,"a small white house with brown trimmings, overrun with rambler roses up to the top"
8068,"The lawn was full of them, big pots flanked each side of every step of the porch, pink or yellow clusters framed each window, and the terrace with the stone balustrade, which enclosed this pretty little dwelling, had a garland of enormous red bells, like drops of blood"
8069,"Behind the house I saw a long avenue of orange trees in blossom, which went up to the foot of the mountain"
8070,"they had crossed the sea, to love each other in that antique island, the daughter of Greece, in that immense orange wood which surrounds Palermo, and which is called the “Shell of Gold"
8071,"She, blond, charming, but affected, according to the fashion of her day, was smiling, with her pretty mouth and blue eyes;"
8072,"A door opened and a little woman entered, old, very old, very small, with white hair and white eyebrows, a veritable white mouse, and as quick and furtive of movement"
8073,"A kind of glass-enclosed veranda, filled with shrubs, opened into the dining-room, revealing at the farther end the long avenue of orange trees extending to the foot of the mountain"
8074,"She rose, and as the little domestic, awkward in his green livery, removed the chair behind her, she whispered quickly a few words into his ear"
8075,"The full moon made a narrow path of silver, a long bright line, which fell on the yellow sand, between the round, opaque crowns of the dark trees"
8076,"The youth was dressed in a suit of white satin, such as men wore in the eighteenth century, and had on a hat with an ostrich plume"
8077,"and seemed to instill into our looks, our breasts, and our souls the light and happy feeling of the south, that odor of the parched earth, of the stony and light soil of the olive with its gray-green foliage"
8078,"She was a young and pretty woman, certainly a native of the south of France, with splendid eyes, beautiful wavy black hair, which was so thick and long that it seemed almost too heavy for her head"
8079,"she wore earrings with large white stones that were certainly not diamonds, and she belonged unmistakably to the People"
8080,"Their breath makes the air heavy and relaxing, and the still more penetrating odor of the orange blossoms sweetens the atmosphere till it might almost be called the refinement of odor"
8081,"The shore, with its brown rocks, was bathed by the motionless Mediterranean"
8082,"The hot summer sun stretched like a fiery cloth over the mountains, over the long expanses of sand, and over the motionless, apparently solid blue sea"
8083,"When she had finished the little red heap, which soon disappeared under the rapid action of her hands, I asked her:"
8084,"The scent of the orange trees became more penetrating, and we breathed with delight, distending our lungs to inhale it more deeply"
8085,I covered the carriage-lamp with its blue shade and watched the strange fly careering about in its fiery flight
8086,"She opened her black eyes wide with vague surprise, and said, “Che ni fa?”"
8087,"She replied with her eternal “Che mi fa!” I thereupon took up her little black wooden trunk, such as servants use, and took it into the room on the right, which I had chosen for her"
8088,"A cloud of violet powder, a vague white mist, seemed still to be floating in the air, from the effects of her over-powdering her face and neck"
8089,"put on your blue dress and your hat with the flowers, and make haste"
8090,Monsieur Lantin's despair was so great that his hair became white in one month
8091,"a clear, blue sky smiled on the busy city below"
8092,"We had been walking since the morning along the coast, with the blue sea bathed in sunlight on one side of us, and the shore covered with crops on the other"
8093,"I had been told, that evening, that I should meet with hospitality at the house of a Frenchman who lived in an orange grove at the end of a promontory"
8094,"It was situated as described, at the end of a promontory in the midst of a grove of orange trees"
8095,"The orange blossoms exhaled their powerful, delicious fragrance"
8096,"On the walls were two pretty paintings by well-known artists, draperies, weapons, swords and pistols, and exactly in the middle, on the principal panel, a square of white satin in a gold frame"
8097,"We had gone out on the wide balcony from whence we could see two gulfs, one to the right and the other to the left, enclosed by high gray mountains"
8098,"Look, do you see that little white spot beneath my left eye?"
8099,Is it those gray eyes whose glance penetrates you like a gimlet and remains there like the point of an arrow?
8100,A strong perfume of orange blossoms pervaded the air
8101,“That lady in black over there?”
8102,"On the white mountain the houses, massed together, makes an even whiter spot"
8103,"The pale streaks of foam, clinging to the black rocks, whose countless peaks rise up out of the water, look like bits of rag floating and drifting on the surface of the sea"
8104,"On the other side of the straits she saw, from morning until night, a little white speck on the coast"
8105,Then the old woman went to the store and bought a piece of black sausage
8106,"Two neighbors, seated before their door, remembered perfectly having seen an old beggar come out with a thin, black dog which was eating something that its master was giving him"
8107,"Chatel-Guyon consists of a stream in which flows yellow water, in the midst of several hillocks on which are a casino, some houses, and some stone crosses"
8108,"I perceive, at the left, the first great billows of the mountains of Auvergne, covered with woods, and here and there big gray patches, hard masses of lava, for we are at the foot of the extinct volcanoes"
8109,"At the right, through the narrow cut of the valley, I discover a plain, infinite as the sea, steeped in a bluish fog which lets one only dimly discern the villages, the towns, the yellow fields of ripe grain, and the green squares of meadowland shaded with apple trees"
8110,"A man with a big black hat on his head is driving them with a slender stick, tipping them on the side or on the forehead;"
8111,"—I am packing up my trunks and saying good-by to the charming little district so calm and silent, to the green mountain, to the quiet valleys, to the deserted Casino, from which you can see, almost veiled by its light, bluish mist, the immense plain of the Limagne"
8112,I got an indistinct impression of it as of a gray shadow outlined against the misty sky
8113,"The rocky castle rising out there in the distance like a weird, seignorial residence, like a dream palace, strange and beautiful-this alone remained black in the crimson light of the dying day"
8114,He only demanded in addition a few of those delicious gray mullet which are caught around the solitary mount
8115,"The following spring all the evil spirit's lands were covered with golden wheat, oats as big as beans, flax, magnificent colza, red clover, peas, cabbage, artichokes, everything that develops into grains or fruit in the sunlight"
8116,"First there was a 'vol-au-vent', full of cocks' crests and kidneys, with meat-balls, then two big gray mullet with cream sauce, a turkey stuffed with chestnuts soaked in wine, some salt-marsh lamb as tender as cake, vegetables which melted in the mouth and nice hot pancake which was brought on smoking and spreading a delicious odor of butter"
8117,"They drank new, sweet, sparkling cider and heady red wine, and after each course they whetted their appetites with some old apple brandy"
8118,"“He continued, pointing to my red ribbon:"
8119,Pauls and Virginias were kissing each other under palm trees bathed in a pink light
8120,"They were walking slowly, arm in arm, clad in long, white tea-gowns covered with lace"
8121,"The white road stretched in front of him, then under a blaze of brilliant sunshine, so they went on slowly in the burning heat"
8122,"How well she remembered those long days which she spent lying under an orange tree, looking up at the round, red fruit, amid the green leaves"
8123,"She dreamed of its immense blue expanse sparkling under the sun, with the white sails of the small vessels, and a mountain on the horizon"
8124,"She could still see the pale face of her lover, who kissed her hand every moment, and the clean-shaven face of the doctor and the nurse's white cap"
8125,"The whole valley was deserted and silent in the dazzling light and the overwhelming heat, and only the grasshoppers uttered their shrill, continuous chirp among the sparse yellow grass on both sides of the road"
8126,"Her white hair, which hung in curls on both sides of her face, had become tangled"
8127,Four calves were grazing under the shade of the trees and black hens were wandering all about the enclosure
8128,"the house door was open, but nobody was to be seen, and so they went in, when immediately a large black dog came out of a barrel that was standing under a pear tree, and began to bark furiously"
8129,"She limped with her right leg, and in her brown knitted jacket, that was faded by the sun and washed out by the rain, she looked like a poor, wretched, dirty servant"
8130,"“The blacksmith at the corner of the highroad,” he replied, and then they were all silent, with their eyes fixed on the door of the cow house, which formed a sort of black hole in the wall of the building"
8131,"It was a small, comfortable house painted yellow, at the corner of a street behind Saint Etienne's Church, and from the windows one could see the docks full of ships being unloaded, the big salt marsh, and, rising beyond it, the Virgin's Hill with its old gray chapel"
8132,"Raphaele, who came from Marseilles, played the indispensable part of the handsome Jewess, and was thin, with high cheekbones, which were covered with rouge, and black hair covered with pomatum, which curled on her forehead"

8137,"They consulted one another by their looks or in a whisper, and replied in the same manner, and Madame Tellier was longingly handling a pair of orange garters that were broader and more imposing looking than the rest;"
8138,"At Oissel they changed trains, and at a little station further on Monsieur Joseph Rivet was waiting for them with a large cart with a number of chairs in it, drawn by a white horse"
8139,"They clung on to the sides of the vehicle, their bonnets fell on their backs, over their faces and on their shoulders, and the white horse went on stretching out his head and holding out his little hairless tail like a rat's, with which he whisked his buttocks from time to time"
8140,"The green country extended on either side of the road, and here and there the colza in flower presented a waving expanse of yellow, from which arose a strong, wholesome, sweet and penetrating odor, which the wind carried to some distance"
8141,"The cornflowers showed their little blue heads amid the rye, and the women wanted to pick them, but Monsieur Rivet refused to stop"
8142,"Then, sometimes, a whole field appeared to be covered with blood, so thick were the poppies, and the cart, which looked as if it were filled with flowers of more brilliant hue, jogged on through fields bright with wild flowers, and disappeared behind the trees of a farm, only to reappear and to go on again through the yellow or green standing crops, which were studded with red or blue"
8143,"The church was at the end of the street and was surrounded by a small churchyard, and four immense lime-trees, which stood just outside the porch, shaded it completely"
8144,"The sun was already high in the blue sky, which still had a rosy tint toward the horizon, like a faint remaining trace of dawn"
8145,"Families of fowls were walking about outside the houses, and here and there a black cock, with a glistening breast, raised his head, which was crowned by his red comb, flapped his wings and uttered his shrill crow, which the other cocks repeated"
8146,"The men had put on their blue smocks over their new frock-coats or over their old dress-coats of green-cloth, the two tails of which hung down below their blouses"
8147,"The little girls disappeared in a cloud of muslin, which looked like whipped cream, while the lads, who looked like embryo waiters in a cafe and whose heads shone with pomatum, walked with their legs apart, so as not to get any dust or dirt on their black trousers"
8148,"She almost fancied that that day had returned, when she was so small and was almost hidden in her white dress, and she began to cry"
8149,"The cantors, in all the dignity of their white surplices, went on in somewhat uncertain voices, and the reed stop itself seemed hoarse, as if the instrument had been weeping;"
8150,"They started off in the same way as they had come the day before, and the little white horse started off with his quick, dancing trot"
8151,"And then he watched a white pocket-handkerchief, which somebody was waving, as it disappeared in the distance"
8152,"Monsieur Poulin, the ex-mayor, was talking to Rosa, and she was running her hands through the old gentleman's white whiskers"
8153,and he shivered at the dreadful thought of this red liquid which had come from his veins and covered his bed
8154,The wounded man was stretched out on clean white sheets
8155,"The lawyer noticed it, opened his arms with a broad gesture, spreading out the long black sleeves of his robe like the wings of a bat, and exclaimed:"
8156,"Two men were kept busy rinsing the glasses or bowls in a bucket and immediately holding them under the spigots, from which flowed the red stream of wine or the golden stream of pure cider;"
8157,"I found her sitting in an armchair, fully dressed, pale and with red eyes"
8158,The dainty perfume of violet is everywhere
8159,"By Jove, how tempting they are in their light, thin dresses, which occasionally give one a glimpse of the delicate pink flesh beneath!"
8160,Her eyes were like two black spots on white enamel
8161,When she passed close enough to touch me I felt as though I were standing before a red hot furnace
8162,"what a bliss it is, to stand at a discreet distance and watch the hidden pink and blue ribbons, partly concealed, to observe the hazy lines of the beloved one's form, as they become visible through the last of the filmy garments!"
8163,"“Her back was turned towards me, and suddenly, my eyes were irresistibly drawn to a large black spot right between her shoulders"
8164,"Then my mind reverted to the faint down on her lip, the heavy eyebrows almost meeting over her coal-black eyes, her glossy black hair —I should have been prepared for some surprise"
8165,His hair was quite white and he walked bent over as though completely exhausted
8166,"Why did I take that comb with a shudder, and why did I hold in my hands her long black hair that gave my skin a frightful cold sensation, as though I were handling snakes?"
8167,My military cape was covered with long black hairs!
8168,"The village, a large village, almost a market town, was a few hundred yards away, closely circling the church, a red brick church, black with age"
8169,"Her walk reminded one of a storm, as she swayed about, and her head, which was always covered with an enormous white cap, whose ribbons fluttered down her back, seemed to traverse the horizon from north to south and from south to north, at each step"
8170,"One of her legs in a blue stocking, the longer one, no doubt, was extended under her chair, and her spectacles glistened against the wall, as they had rolled away from her"
8171,"When he was still quite a small boy he used to wear a zinc cross of the Legion of Honor pinned on his tunic, just as other children wear a soldier's cap, and he took his mother's hand in the street with a proud air, sticking out his little chest with its red ribbon and metal star so that it might show to advantage"
8172,"Then he would walk slowly, looking at every coat with a practiced eye for the little bit of red ribbon, and when he had got to the end of his walk he always repeated the numbers aloud"
8173,"Whenever he saw a group of white-haired old gentlemen standing together in the middle of the pavement, interfering with the traffic, he used to say to himself:"
8174,"But suddenly he remained motionless, struck dumb with astonishment—there was a red ribbon in the buttonhole:"
8175,A little piece of white paper fell to the floor out of the pocket of the overcoat
8176,“Do you know the people who live in the little red cottage at the end of the Rue du Berceau?”

8182,Just as he reached the little black body with its crimsoned head he received a violent blow in his back which made him let go his hold of his crutches and sent him flying ten paces distant
8183,"“Yes, master, the big gray rabbit, from the hutch on the left”;"
8184,“Somebody has stolen the gray rabbit
8185,“The big gray one
8186,"Lenient, who was short and stout, took off his kepi, laid himself on his stomach, and, putting his face on the floor, looked at the black cavity under the bed, and then, suddenly, he exclaimed:"

8194,"The heavy gray clouds were being driven rapidly through the sky by the gusts of wind which whistled among the trees, and one felt that it would rain soon"
8195,"Here and there in the fields there rose up stacks of wheat straw, like huge yellow mushrooms, and the fields looked bare, as they had already been sown for the next year"
8196,"Worn out and weakened with fatigue, he took longer strides, so as not to take so many steps, and with heavy head, the blood throbbing in his temples, with red eyes and dry mouth, he grasped his stick tightly in his hand, with a longing to strike the first passerby who might be going home to supper"
8197,"“A set of hogs” as he looked at the thin gray smoke which rose from the roofs, for it was the dinner hour"
8198,"men in blue blouses, women in white caps, some on foot, some in carts, began to pass along the road, going to the neighboring villages to spend Sunday with friends or relations"
8199,"They were walking slowly side by side, glittering in the sun with their shining hats, their yellow accoutrements and their metal buttons, as if to frighten evildoers, and to put them to flight at a distance"
8200,"And they set off toward the village, the red tiles of which could be seen through the leafless trees, a quarter of a league off"
8201,"' That is a weak white wine which we have christened so, because if you drink too much of it it prevents you from sleeping and takes the place of a nightcap"

8204,"The man was very tall and thin, rather stooped, with perfectly white hair, too white for his comparatively youthful physiognomy;"

8212,"He made his toilet with feminine coquetry, put on a white waistcoat, which suited him better with the coat than a black one, sent for the hairdresser to give him a finishing touch with the curling iron, for he had preserved his hair, and started very early in order to show his eagerness to see her"
8213,"He rose up abruptly, and, turning round, beheld an old woman with white hair who extended both hands toward him"
8214,"That woman of far-off dreams, the blonde with gray eyes, the young girl who used to call him “Jaquelet” so prettily?"
8215,"“Do you remember, Lison?” forgetting this white-haired lady who was looking at him tenderly"

8223,"At Jourdain's the great room was filled with eaters, just as the vast court was filled with vehicles of every sort—wagons, gigs, chars-a-bancs, tilburies, innumerable vehicles which have no name, yellow with mud, misshapen, pieced together, raising their shafts to heaven like two arms, or it may be with their nose on the ground and their rear in the air"

8231,"He lay on his back, with eyes fixed on the ceiling, motionless, his arms raised like wings, warming against his body the rudimentary chickens enclosed in their white shells"
8232,"as if he feared a noise as much as motion, and he took a feverish interest in the yellow hen who was accomplishing in the poultry-yard the same task as he"
8233,“Has the yellow hen eaten her food all right?” he would ask his wife
8234,“The yellow hen has seven chickens!

8322,"After two hours' travelling over stony roads, across that green and monotonous plain, the vehicle entered one of those orchard farmyards and drew up before in old structure falling into decay, where an old maid-servant stood waiting beside a young fellow, who took charge of the horse"
8323,In this farmyard the Norman smell of apples was as strong as that of the bloom of orange trees on the shores of the south of France
8324,"I was shocked to find my father's old servant with perfectly white hair, though he was not more than forty-five or forty-six years of age"
8325,"“He opened a gate, and I saw some crosses of black wood"
8326,"“We fell on our knees in the damp grass, he and I, with the lantern between us, and I saw the rain beating on the white marble slab"
8327,"The July sun streamed in at the window and the open door and cast its hot flames on the uneven brown clay floor, which had been stamped down by four generations of clodhoppers"
8328,"The cows lying down in the fields, overcome by the heat, raised their heads heavily and lowed feebly at the two passers-by, as if to ask them for some green grass"
8329,"She was lying on her back, on her wretched bed, her hands covered with a purple cotton counterpane, horribly thin, knotty hands, like the claws of strange animals, like crabs, half closed by rheumatism, fatigue and the work of nearly a century which she had accomplished"
8330,Some men who were working at a distance took off their large hats and remained motionless until the white vestment had disappeared behind some farm buildings;
8331,"the frightened black hens ran away along the ditch until they reached a well-known hole, through which they suddenly disappeared, while a foal which was tied in a meadow took fright at the sight of the surplice and began to gallop round and round, kicking cut every now and then"
8332,"The acolyte, in his red cassock, walked quickly, and the priest, with his head inclined toward one shoulder and his square biretta on his head, followed him, muttering some prayers;"
8333,"the scanty window curtains, which had formerly been white, but were now yellow and covered with fly-specks, looked as if they were going to fly off, as if they were struggling to get away, like the old woman's soul"
8334,"He was a tall, thin man, with a heavy black mustache"
8335,"The lawyer double-locked the door and began to read the will, after having opened, in our presence, the envelope, sealed with red wax, of the contents of which he was ignorant"
8336,And he fancied he was already leaning against a wall in-front of four rifles whose little black apertures seemed to be gazing at him
8337,"It was quite a dark, black and silent night"
8338,"Then, intoxicated with drink and food, besotted, red in the face, shaken by hiccoughs, his mind clouded and his speech thick, he unbuttoned his uniform in order to breathe or he could not have taken a step"
8339,"The broad fish with their white bellies lay beside him, quivering in the throes of death;"
8340,"Towards evening Javel, junior, called his comrades and showed them some black spots, all the horrible tokens of mortification in the portion of the arm below the broken bones"
8341,"He wore shoes with silver buckles, knee-breeches, a snuff-colored frock coat, a lace jabot, and an outlandish gray hat with wide brim and long-haired surface that might have come out of the ark"
8342,The black dress of La Castris seemed to be saturated with sunlight
8343,"A mass of flowers of all species and color flung their fragrance to the breeze, while a cytisus covered with yellow clusters scattered its fine pollen abroad, a golden cloud, with an odor of honey that bore its balmy seed across space, similar to the sachet-powders of perfumers"
8344,"The senator stopped, breathed in the cloud of floating pollen, looked at the fertile shrub, yellow as the sun, whose seed was floating in the air, and said:"
8345,"“The servant at our inn was eighteen at most, with very blue eyes, a pale blue with two tiny black pupils, short teeth close together, which she showed continually when she laughed, and which seemed strong enough to grind granite"
8346,The chateau still laved its gray wall in the pond outside the little town;
8347,"His clothes were ragged, he was hideously dirty, with long yellow hair, so tangled that it looked like strands of rope falling down at either side of his face"
8348,"I looked at this animal whose long yellow hair reminded me of a straw heap, and the beggar, embarrassed by my gaze, stopped laughing, turned his head aside, and wanted to get away"
8349,"A gust of wind passing through the tree shook its yellow clusters, enveloping in a fragrant and delicate mist the two old men, who inhaled in the fragrance with deep breaths"
8350,"He was a big peasant of the district of Caux, with a red face, large chest and stomach, and perched on two legs that seemed too slight for the bulk of his body"
8351,"One morning as he was eating his luncheon with the servants the door opened and the mayor of the commune, Maitre Chicot, appeared, followed by a soldier wearing a black copper-pointed helmet"
8352,"He was a big, young fellow with plump, white skin, blue eyes, fair hair, unshaven to his cheek bones, who looked stupid, timid and good"
8353,"“I will take him, Antoine, and I invite you to eat some black pudding"
8354,"The Norman, red as a tomato, his eyes ablaze, filled up the glasses and clinked, saying:"
8355,"Although it was dark, Father Anthony could distinguish the bloodstain on the white snow"
8356,"The earth was all white, the farm buildings standing out like black patches"
8357,"When the pit was deep enough he rolled the corpse into it with the fork, covered it with earth, which he stamped down for some time, and then put back the manure, and he smiled as he saw the thick snow finishing his work and covering up its traces with a white sheet"
8358,He was sitting between a large red globe and a blue one
8359,"Lefevre was a country dame, a widow, one of these half peasants, with ribbons and bonnets with trimming on them, one of those persons who clipped her words and put on great airs in public, concealing the soul of a pretentious animal beneath a comical and bedizened exterior, just as the country-folks hide their coarse red hands in ecru silk gloves"
8360,"The two women lived in a little house with green shutters by the side of the high road in Normandy, in the centre of the country of Caux"
8361,"The baker, who knew all that occurred, brought in his wagon one morning a strange little yellow animal, almost without paws, with the body of a crocodile, the head of a fox, and a curly tail—a true cockade, as big as all the rest of him"
8362,"Rose followed her, wiping her eyes on the corner of her blue apron"
8363,"As they entered the white gateway of the husband's farm, forty shots resounded without their seeing those who fired, as they were hidden in the ditches"
8364,"They were red, parti-colored, flaming shawls, and their brightness seemed to astonish the black fowls on the dung-heap, the ducks on the side of the pond and the pigeons on the thatched roofs"
8365,"and at eight o'clock they were still eating, and the men, in their shirt-sleeves, with their waistcoats unbuttoned and with red faces, were swallowing down the food and drink as if they had been whirlpools"
8366,"The full moon flooded the yard with yellow light, and the reflection of the apple trees made black shadows at their feet, while in the distance the fields gleamed, covered with the ripe corn"
8367,"Before us wound the Seine, with its scattered islands and bordered by white banks, covered with a forest on the right and on the left immense meadows, bounded by another forest yonder in the distance"
8368,"Three enormous steam boats were starting out, one behind the other, for Havre, and a chain of boats, a bark, two schooners and a brig, were going upstream to Rouen, drawn by a little tug that emitted a cloud of black smoke"
8369,He carved these little wooden statues himself—they are comical in the extreme—and painted them all bright green one year when they were painting his house
8370,"Autumn, marvellous autumn, blended its gold and purple with the remaining traces of verdure"
8371,"At our right a very small slate-covered building, with a bell tower as large as a sunshade, adjoined a pretty house with green Venetian blinds, and all covered with honeysuckle and roses"
8372,"He was a man about sixty, thin and with a goatee and long, white mustache"
8373,"They gave us a delicious luncheon outside beneath two lime trees, beside the little chapel and overlooking the vast landscape"
8374,"She bought him one for eighteen francs, and said, getting red with anger as she gave it to her husband:"
8375,"She got red in the face, and felt inclined to fly into a rage"
8376,"It was a yellow wagon, mounted on wheels which had once been yellow, but were now almost gray through the accumulation of mud"
8377,"Three white horses, with enormous heads and great round knees, were the first things one noticed"
8378,"He was a large, powerful, robust man with a red face and a genial expression"
8379,"His wife followed him, small and thin, like a tired animal, carrying a large green umbrella in her hands"
8380,"A large peasant, heavier than an ox, made the springs bend, and was in turn engulfed in the interior of the yellow chest"
8381,"All these people wore the blue blouse over quaint and antique coats of a black or greenish cloth, Sunday clothes which they would only uncover in the streets of Havre"
8382,A couple of drops dripped into the white bowl
8383,"Suddenly, at the bottom of the bowl appeared a little brown spot, no bigger than a tiny seed"
8384,"We were gliding along the pier, black with people"
8385,"The big July sun was shining down on the red parasols, the light dresses, the joyous faces and on the ocean, barely stirred by a ripple"
8386,"On our left was the broad estuary of the Seine, her muddy water, which never mingles with that of the ocean, making large yellow streaks clearly outlined against the immense sheet of the pure green sea"
8387,"And the old maids, thinner yet, opening their characteristic jaws to the wind, seemed to threaten one with their long, yellow teeth"
8388,"This one had blue eyes, the kind of blue which seems to contain all the poetry, all the dreams, all the hopes and happiness of the world!"
8389,"and Daddy Taille, who had got red up to his ears, looked round the table fiercely"
8390,"In this manner, at least we avoid a great amount of red tape and delay"
8391,"And in got a cook, red-faced and out of breath"
8392,Soldiers in red trousers had escorted him to the tomb and men in white cravats had spoken words and shed tears that seemed to be sincere beside his grave
8393,"to make therein a little hole, nothing but a little hole, to see that red thing flow which is the blood, which makes life;"
8394,"Elegant black evening suits, in search of fresh or faded but appetizing novelty, wandering through the excited crowds, looking, searching, while the masqueraders seemed moved above all by the desire for amusement"
8395,"All were watching this sad face as he lay on the straw chairs, his eyes closed, his face covered with white hair, some long, falling from the forehead over the face, others short, growing around the face and the chin, and beside this poor head, that pretty little, neat varnished, smiling mask"
8396,"The door at which they had knocked was opened by an old woman, neat looking, with a white nightcap enclosing a thin face with sharp features, one of those good, rough faces of a hard-working and faithful woman"
8397,She shrugged her shoulders and turned red from the anger which was slowly rising within her and she cried out:
8398,"The old man was sitting on his bed, with a tipsy look, his long white hair falling over his face"
8399,"In a few seconds she made him look like a model fit for a great painter, with his long white locks flowing on his neck"
8400,"how pretty he was, monsieur, with his curly raven locks and black eyes as large as saucers!"
8401,"Oh, monsieur, when I saw his first white hair I felt a terrible shock and then a great joy—a wicked joy—but so great, so great!"
8402,He was going to have white hair!
8403,“'I found white hairs
8404,"The brown sail was hoisted, swelled a little, fluttered, hesitated and swelling out again as round as a paunch, carried the boats towards the large arched entrance that could be faintly distinguished in the darkness"
8405,"The coast still seemed veiled, the great white coast, perpendicular as a wall"
8406,"Sometimes the mother birds will not leave their nests, and are riddled with shot, causing drops of blood to spurt out on the white cliff, and the animal dies without having deserted her eggs"
8407,"but when the party returned toward ten o'clock, beneath a brilliant sun, which cast great triangles of light on the white cliffs along the coast he appeared a little worried, and absentminded, contrary to his accustomed manner"
8408,As soon as they got on shore a kind of servant dressed in black came up to him and said something in a low tone
8409,As soon as breakfast was over the valet in black appeared
8410,"The train stopped at a small station, and as I got out of the carriage, a stout, a very stout man with red cheeks and a big stomach rushed up to me with open arms, exclaiming:"
8411,"Then the sweet romances of my life, whose living heroines are now white-haired, plunged me into the deep melancholy of things"
8412,“A kind of black phantom appeared and raised her veil as soon as Jean had left the room
8413,"yes, I know—hasheesh, opium, green tea—artificial paradises"
8415,A tall workman with a beard and black curly hair was staring at him good-naturedly
8416,They arrived in front of a very neat little white house
8417,the red glare of a formidable furnace alone lit up with great flashes five blacksmiths;
8418,"They were standing enveloped in flame, like demons, their eyes fixed on the red-hot iron they were pounding;"
8419,"He grew as red as a beet, and he would cough it up, stamping, twisting, choking, beating the air with his hands"
8420,"The old grandmother and a girl sat behind them on two chairs, and a boy with yellow hair was lying at the bottom of the wagon, with nothing to be seen of him except his head"
8421,"a very long way off, beyond the plains and village, one could see the sombre green of the forests"
8422,"The river sparkled in the sun, and they had a feeling of quiet enjoyment, felt refreshed as they drank in the purer air that was not impregnated by the black smoke of factories nor by the miasma from the deposits of night soil"
8423,"It was a white country inn, built by the roadside, and through the open door she could see the bright zinc of the counter, at which sat two workmen in their Sunday clothes"
8424,"The boy with the yellow hair had got down by stepping on the wheel, and he helped Monsieur Dufour to lift his grandmother out"
8425,"She was tall, had a small waist and large hips, with a dark skin, very large eyes and very black hair"
8426,"“Hello!” suddenly exclaimed the young man with the yellow hair, who was wandering about"
8427,"They hung side by side, like two tall, slender girls, in their narrow shining length, and made one wish to float in them on warm summer mornings and evenings along the flower-covered banks of the river, where the trees dip their branches into the water, where the rushes are continually rustling in the breeze and where the swift kingfishers dart about like flashes of blue lightning"
8428,"The other got up immediately, and holding his black and red boating cap in his hand, he politely offered the ladies the only shady place in the garden"
8429,"Monsieur Dufour, annoyed at the presence of the polite strangers, was trying to find a comfortable position which he did not, however, succeed in doing, and the young man with the yellow hair was eating as silently as an ogre"
8430,"The girl was looking at them sideways now, and the young fellow with the yellow hair, who had swallowed some wine the wrong way, was coughing violently and bespattering Madame Dufour's cherry-colored silk dress"
8431,"The apprentice was shaking his yellow wig in a happy frame of mind, and kept helping himself to wine, and the old grandmother, feeling the effects of the wine, was very stiff and dignified"
8432,"As for the girl, one noticed only a peculiar brightness in her eyes, while the brown cheeks became more rosy"
8433,"Then one of the rowers came up with two fishing rods in his hands, and the hope of catching a gudgeon, that great vision of the Parisian shopkeeper, made Dufour's dull eyes gleam, and he politely allowed them to do whatever they liked, while he sat in the shade under the bridge, with his feet dangling over the river, by the side of the young man with the yellow hair, who was sleeping soundly"
8434,The blue sky appeared to them clouded and the ardent sun darkened;
8435,"Monsieur Dufour, who was now sober, was waiting for them very impatiently, while the young man with the yellow hair was having a mouthful of something to eat before leaving the inn"
8436,"She was sitting on the grass, looking very sad, while by her side, still in his shirt sleeves, the young man with the yellow hair was sleeping soundly, like some animal"
8437,"On the front seat are two small hampers of white satin filled with violets, and on the bearskin by which their knees are covered there is a mass of roses, mimosas, pinks, daisies, tuberoses and orange blossoms, interwoven with silk ribbons;"
8438,"The clear blue sea, as calm as a mill-pond, stretches out as far as the horizon, where it blends with the sky;"
8439,"The two young women, leaning back under the heavy robes, look out lazily over the blue expanse of water"
8440,She had beautiful black eyes and a charming complexion;
8441,"A small table close to the dying woman's couch bore, on a white cloth, two lighted candles, for the priest was expected at any moment to administer extreme unction and the last communion"
8442,her hair was white at thirty;
8443,"The immense court, surrounded by five rows of magnificent trees, which sheltered the delicate apple trees from the harsh wind of the plain, inclosed in its confines long brick buildings used for storing fodder and grain, beautiful stables built of hard stone and made to accommodate thirty horses, and a red brick residence which looked like a little chateau"
8444,"Every day, at noon, fifteen persons, masters, farmhands and the women folks, seated themselves around the long kitchen table where the soup was brought in steaming in a large, blue-flowered bowl"
8445,"A very old white horse, which the mistress wished to keep until its natural death, because she had brought it up and had always used it, and also because it recalled many happy memories, was housed, through sheer kindness of heart, at the end of the stable"
8446,"His coat, which was no longer curried, looked like white hair, and his long eyelashes gave to his eyes a sad expression"
8447,"He was a thin, long-legged, dirty child, with thick, coarse, bristly red hair"
8448,Not until the blue blouse of the young peasant was out of sight would he lower his thin white head to the grass
8449,"The sight of all that green food, which stretched out on all sides of him, served to increase the gnawing pangs of hunger"
8450,"He came nearer, looked at the animal, threw at his head a clump of earth which flattened out against the white hair, and he started off again, whistling"
8451,"And the grass grew thick, green and vigorous, fed by the poor body"
8452,"Now she was resting in her bed, lying on her back, her eyes closed, her features calm, her long white hair carefully arranged as though she had done it up ten minutes before dying"
8453,"The nun was wildly-kissing the dead woman's hand, an ivory hand as white as the large crucifix lying across the bed"
8454,"He was red and out of breath from his interrupted digestion, for he had made himself a strong mixture of coffee and brandy in order to combat the fatigue of the last few nights and of the wake which was beginning"
8455,"Out of the drawer they took about ten little packages of yellow paper, tied with care and arranged one beside the other"
8456,"Who has not passed a night awake in one of those small, rattling country stage-coaches, in regions where steam is still a thing unknown, beside a strange young woman, of whom one has caught only a glimpse in the dim light of the lantern, as she entered the carriage in front of a white house in some small country town?"
8457,"She was at least seventy years old, tall, skinny, and angular, and her white hair was puffed around her temples in the old-fashioned style"
8458,"This lake is so round that it seems as if the outline had been drawn with a pair of compasses, so clear and blue that one might deem it a flood of azure come down from the sky, so charming that one would like to live in a hut on the wooded slope which dominates this crater, where the cold, still water is sleeping"
8459,"dear child, whom I had held in his diapers or my knee, and who had nursed at my breast with his little greedy lips—was it he, this tall, brown boy, who no longer knew how to kiss me, who seemed to love me as a matter of duty, who called me 'mother' for the sake of politeness, and who kissed me on the forehead, when I felt like crushing him in my arms?"
8460,He had a magnificent red leather collar made for her which bore these words engraved on a copper plate:
8461,"He looked fixedly at the collar, then he stretched out his arm, seized the neck, swung the corpse round and drew it up close to him and read on the copper which had turned green and which still stuck to the discolored leather:"
8462,"“Then, following the old Corsican custom, his sister, in her indignation carried away his black clothes, in order that he might not wear mourning for a dead man who had not been avenged"
8463,A black liquid had oozed out of her mouth
8464,"A great, wild lake, filled with stagnant, black water, in which thousands of reeds were waving to and fro, lay in the midst of a vast circle of naked hills, where nothing grew but broom, or here and there an oak curiously twisted by the wind"
8465,"Then he took me down to the end of the lake, where I suddenly perceived a ruin on the other side of the bank a dilapidated hut, with an enormous red cross on the wall that looked as if it might have been traced with blood, as it gleamed in the last rays of the setting sun"
8466,"One evening an old man with a white beard, who seemed to be at least two hundred years old, and who could hardly drag himself along, asked alms of this forlorn woman, as he passed her dwelling"
8467,"He was a tall man of forty or thereabout, this Jules Chicot, the innkeeper of Spreville, with a red face and a round stomach, and said by those who knew him to be a smart business man"
8468,"The innkeeper was delighted and treated her like a lady, giving her roast fowl, black pudding, leg of mutton and bacon and cabbage"
8469,"Sometimes alone, sometimes with a soldier from his own part of the country, he would slowly saunter along by cages containing parrots with green backs and yellow heads from the banks of the Amazon, or parrots with gray backs and red heads from Senegal, or enormous macaws, which look like birds reared in hot-houses, with their flower-like feathers, their plumes and their tufts"
8470,"Parrots of every size, who seem painted with minute care by the miniaturist, God Almighty, and the little birds, all the smaller birds hopped about, yellow, blue and variegated, mingling their cries with the noise of the quay;"
8471,"Boitelle would pause, with wondering eyes, wide-open mouth, laughing and enraptured, showing his teeth to the captive cockatoos, who kept nodding their white or yellow topknots toward the glaring red of his breeches and the copper buckle of his belt"
8472,"On one occasion, having stopped almost in ecstasy before an enormous macaw, which was swelling out its plumes, bending forward and bridling up again as if making the court curtseys of parrot-land, he saw the door of a little cafe adjoining the bird dealer's shop open, and a young negress appeared, wearing on her head a red silk handkerchief"
8473,"Almost every day he passed before the Cafe des Colonies, and often he could distinguish through the window the figure of the little black-skinned maid serving “bocks” or glasses of brandy to the sailors of the port"
8474,"and Boitelle felt his heart touched when he suddenly saw, glittering between the dark lips of the girl, a shining row of white teeth"
8475,"For him it was a treat, a happiness, on which his thoughts dwelt constantly, to watch the black hand of the little maid pouring something into his glass while her teeth laughed more than her eyes"
8476,"On his arrival in Havre he abandoned to the care of this compassionate oyster dealer the little black creature, who had been hidden on board his vessel, he knew not why or by whom"
8477,She is not a white slip
8478,How much of her is black?
8479,"Everywhere, just as you are white everywhere"
8480,Is it as black as the pot?”
8481,“Are there more black people besides her in her country?”
8482,"“It doesn't soil the underwear more than other skins, this black skin?”"
8483,"She had put on, for this journey to the house of her lover's parents, her most beautiful and most gaudy clothes, in which yellow, red and blue were the prevailing colors, so that she looked as if she were adorned for a national festival"
8484,"The mother, on seeing this black lady in variegated costume in her son's company, remained so stupefied that she could not open her mouth;"
8485,But on the village green people rushed out of all the houses in a flutter of excitement;
8486,"She is too, too black!”"
8487,"The red leaves, instead of rustling under the feet, were rotting under the heavy downfalls"
8488,"He would stop quickly before a clearing where the white vapor of the moon lights the woods, and he would press my hand, saying:"
8489,"I clearly remember a flayed hand on which was hanging some dried skin and black muscles, and on the snow-white bones could be seen the traces of dried blood"
8490,"And they watched the white sheets as they burned, till they were presently reduced to little crumbling black heaps"
8491,"And as some words were still visible in white tracing, the daughter, with little strokes of the toe of her shoe, crushed the burning paper, mixing it with the old ashes in the fireplace"
8492,"And this is what he told me as we walked along the white high road, with ripe crops on either side of it which rippled like the sea in the light breeze that passed over them"
8493,"His gray hair looked a little like those fur bonnets worn by certain Northern peoples, and his long beard, which fell down over his chest, had also somewhat the appearance of fur"
8494,"two big Normandy fishermen, bearded, their skin tanned through exposure, with the piercing black eyes of the sailor who looks over the horizon like a bird of prey"
8495,"Mathurin kept pouring and winking to the saloon keeper, a big, red-faced man, who chuckled as though at the thought of some fine joke;"
8496,"I went in and after passing through a dining room in which it was very evident that no one ever ate, I entered a typical room of all these women, a furnished room with red curtains and a soiled eiderdown bed covering"
8497,I desired this year to breathe the odor of orange blossoms and I set out for the South of France just at the time that every one else was returning home
8498,"I visited Monaco, the shrine of pilgrims, rival of Mecca and Jerusalem, without leaving any gold in any one else's pockets, and I climbed the high mountain beneath a covering of lemon, orange and olive branches"
8499,"Have you ever slept, my friend, in a grove of orange trees in flower?"
8500,"I sat down tailor fashion, with my legs crossed under me, and remained there in a reverie before this hole, which looked as if it were filled with ink, so black and stagnant was the liquid it contained"
8501,"Distracted, without waiting or stopping to think what was best to do, the tutor jumped into the black water and did not rise again, having struck his head at the bottom of the cistern"
8502,"I left the spot and kept on climbing, leaving the region of orange trees for the region of olive trees, and the region of olive trees for the region of pines;"
8503,"But on the mountain summits, blood-red in the glow of the sunset, in the boundless sky and on the sea, in all this superb landscape that I had come here to admire I saw only two poor children, one lying prone on the edge of a hole filled with black water, the other submerged to his neck, their hands intertwined, weeping opposite each other, in despair"
8504,"For about three weeks there had been seen walking in the streets about ten young East Indians, small, lithe, with dark skins, dressed all in gray and wearing on their heads caps such as English grooms wear"
8505,"The tall straight cliffs that inclose the rounded beach of Etretat and terminate in two celebrated arches, called “the Gates,” lay in shadow, and made two great black patches in the softly lighted landscape"
8506,"At midnight, the lamplighter, running from street to street, extinguished, one after another, the yellow jets of flame that lighted up the sleeping houses, the mud and the puddles of water"
8507,"The door of the little house they occupied was open, and we perceived, lying on a stretcher in the small, dimly lighted vestibule the corpse covered with white silk"
8508,"We could see him plainly as he lay stretched out on his back, his outline clearly defined beneath this white veil"
8509,"The moon had gone down, leaving the muddy, deserted streets in darkness, but the body on the stretcher appeared to be luminous, so dazzlingly white was the silk, and it was a weird sight to see, passing along through the night, the semi-luminous form of this corpse, borne by those men, the dusky skin of whose faces and hands could scarcely be distinguished from their clothing in the darkness"
8510,"Behind the corpse came three Indians, and then, a full head taller than themselves and wrapped in an ample traveling coat of a soft gray color, appeared the outline of an Englishman, a kind and superior man, a friend of theirs, who was their guide and counselor in their European travels"
8511,"It seemed to me that they were carrying there, before me, the conquered genius of India, followed, as in a funeral procession, by the victorious genius of England robed in a gray ulster"
8512,"It was erected in an indentation, at the very foot of the cliff, which rose above it perpendicularly a hundred meters high, perfectly white but looking gray in the night"
8513,"An Indian who was leaning over the brazier rose upright, his two hands in the air, his elbows bent, and all at once we saw arising, all black on the immense white cliff, a colossal shadow, the shadow of Buddha in his hieratic posture"
8514,"Some sea birds who had awakened uttered their plaintive cry, and, describing long curves, flew, with their white wings extended, through the gleam from the funeral pyre and then disappeared in the night"

8713,"Or when at public meetings an eel stood up on end, and wriggled and squirmed lithely in every direction, and declared that, for his part, he went in for rainbows and hot water—how could I help seeing that he was still black and loved a slimy pool?"

8717,"He had black hair, worn off by his hat"
8718,"And I went, during the bright period of his success, to so few of those awful pageants which require a black dress-coat and what the ungodly call, after Mr. Dickens, a white choker, that in the happy retreat of my own dressing-gowns and jackets my days went by as happily and cheaply as those of another Thalaba"
8719,"then came for orders, with a red silk bandanna tied round his head, with his overalls on, and his dress-coat and spectacles off"
8720,and a little girl with a blue sash had been sent to give him a rosebud
8721,"Now came the advantage of his long morning-nap, and of the green tea with which Polly supplied the kitchen"
8722,"till they came to the candied orange at the end of the feast—when Dennis, rather confused, thought he must say something, and tried No"
8723,"The substitutes were red jeans, which, while they did not well match his court costume, were better able to withstand the old man's abuse, for if, in addition to his frequent religious excursions astride his beast, there ever was a man who was fond of sitting down with his feet higher than his head, it was this selfsame Elder Brown"
8724,"The sudden vision which met his wandering gaze, the donkey calmly chewing scrub buds, with the green juice already oozing from the corners of his frothy mouth, acted upon him like magic"
8725,"goldarn an' blue blazes!"""
8726,"The prescription clerk smiled freely, and continued his assaults upon a piece of blue mass"
8727,"I firmly believe that when he had finished his trading, and the little blue-stringed packages had been stored away, could the poor donkey have made his appearance at the door, and gazed with his meek, fawnlike eyes into his master's, he would have obtained full and free forgiveness"
8728,"The glasses shone bright upon the shelves as the swinging door flapped back to let out a coatless clerk, who passed him with a rush, chewing upon a farewell mouthful of brown bread and bologna"
8729,"Elder Brown stirred away the sugar, and let a steady stream of red liquid flow into the glass"
8730,"A pretty, black-eyed girl, struggling to keep down her mirth, came forward and faced him behind the counter"
8731,"pink silk, with delicate pale blue feathers"
8732,"Nancy's head's red, red as a woodpeck's"
8733,"Sorrel's only half-way to the color of her top-knot, an' it do seem like red oughter to soot red"
8734,Nancy's red an' the hat's red;
8735,you black-hearted wretch!
8736,"it's red an' you're red, an' it's a dead match"
8737,"A black boy darted round the corner, from behind which, with several others, he had beheld the brief but stirring scene"
8738,The pink bonnet with the blue plume!
8739,"For he contended, perhaps with justice, that no man in the responsible position he was about to take ought to be expected to go about, or sit about, or even lounge about, without even a continental red in his pocket"
8740,"She was ""nice"" in all her pretty clothes, and she herself was pretty with that type of prettiness which outwears most other types—the prettiness that lies in a rounded figure, a dusky skin, plump, rosy cheeks, white teeth and black eyes"
8741,"We looked off from the brow of the mountain over fifteen miles of billowing green, to where, far across a far stretch of pale blue lay a dim purple line that we knew was Staten Island"
8742,"He found his landmarks, and pointed out to us where the Passaic and the Hackensack flowed, invisible to us, hidden behind great ridges that in our sight were but combings of the green waves upon which we looked down"
8743,"deposited in his desk—or washed to a pulp in his white waistcoat (if white waistcoats be the fashion of the hour), washed out of existence—can you tell where it is?"
8744,There were heavy rings about her pretty black eyes
8745,"She had informed him, however, that at present he was accustomed to drive a big black horse which, in her opinion, was as gentle and reliable as these animals ever became, and she could not imagine how anybody could be afraid of him"
8746,"When the good black horse had jogged along a pleasant road for half an hour Mr. Buller began to feel that, perhaps, for all these years he had been laboring under a misconception"
8747,"You have not any wide stretch of water, such as I like so much, but here is a pretty river, those rolling hills are very charming, and, beyond, you have the blue of the mountains"
8748,"Now there was vigorous splashing and tugging, and then a jet black horse, shining as if he had been newly varnished, pulled a dripping wagon containing two well-soaked men upon a shelving shore"
8749,"Mr. Podington smiled, and leaning backward, he looked up at the beautiful blue sky"
8750,"About half a mile from the town there stood a small cottage where house-cleaning was going on, and on a fence, not far from the canal, there hung a carpet gaily adorned with stripes and spots of red and yellow"
8751,The terrified horse sped on as if a red and yellow demon were after him
8752,"And Colonel Starbottle knew this, as, perspiring, florid, and panting, he rebuttoned the lower buttons of his blue frock-coat, which had become loosed in an oratorical spasm, and readjusted his old-fashioned, spotless shirt frill above it as he strutted from the court-room amidst the hand-shakings and acclamations of his friends"
8753,"He flicked away the dust from his spotless white trousers and varnished boots with his handkerchief, and settled his black cravat under his Byron collar as he neared his office"
8754,"But—er—congratulations of friends—and—er—courtesy due to them—er—interfered with—though perhaps only heightened—by procrastination—pleasure of—ha!"" And the Colonel completed his sentence with a gallant wave of his fat but white and well-kept hand"
8755,"indeed, his small black eyes shone with that fire which a pretty woman or an ""affair of honor"" could alone kindle"
8756,He lightly put aside the compliment with a wave of his white hand
8757,"""Were there any endearments—er—caresses—er—such as taking your hand—er—clasping your waist?"" he suggested, with a gallant yet respectful sweep of his white hand and bowing of his head;—""er— slight pressure of your fingers in the changes of a dance—I mean,"" he corrected himself, with an apologetic cough—""in the passing of the plate?"""
8758,"Yet as her small, trim, youthful figure, with its simple Leghorn straw hat confined by a blue bow under her round chin, passed away before him, she looked more like a child than ever"
8759,"Then tossing it off, he wiped his lips with a large white handkerchief, and leaning back comfortably in his chair, said, with a wave of his hand, ""The interview I requested, Mr. Hotchkiss, concerns a subject—which I may say is—er—er—at present not of a public or business nature—although later it might become—er—er—both"
8760,"A white virginal muslin was belted around her slim figure by a blue ribbon, and her Leghorn hat was drawn around her oval cheek by a bow of the same color"
8761,"She had a Southern girl's narrow feet, encased in white stockings and kid slippers, which were crossed primly before her as she sat in a chair, supporting her arm by her faithful parasol planted firmly on the floor"
8762,"She caught his fat white hand, which was lying on the table, between her own and lifted it to her lips"
8763,"His portly figure was clothed in a blue dress-coat with brass buttons, a buff waistcoat which permitted his frilled shirt front to become erectile above it, a black satin stock which confined a boyish turned-down collar around his full neck, and immaculate drill trousers, strapped over varnished boots"
8764,"It was an old-fashioned brick building, with a portico upheld by tall white pillars"
8765,"The yard was shaded by stately locusts and elms, and a catalpa tree in season rained its pink and white blossoms upon the grass"
8766,"But the Major, with all his queer clothes, his immense area of plaited, raveling shirt bosom, and the little black string tie with the bow always slipping on one side, both was smiled at and liked in Mrs. Vardeman's select boarding house"
8767,"But they were very careful not to let him see their designs, for in spite of his sixty-eight years he could make the boldest of them uncomfortable under the steady regard of his piercing gray eyes"
8768,"At the theater Hargraves was known as an all-round dialect comedian, having a large repertoire of German, Irish, Swede, and black-face specialties"
8769,"Going in, Hargraves would find a little table set with a decanter, sugar bowl, fruit, and a big bunch of fresh green mint"
8770,with what solicitous care he capped the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe!
8771,"The Major was in a white heat of anger, but regained his equanimity, according to his code of manners, as soon as he was in Miss Lydia's presence"
8772,"The Major, in spotless linen, with his extraordinary coat showing only where it was closely buttoned, and his white hair smoothly roached, looked really fine and distinguished"
8773,"The long, thin white hair, curly at the ends, the aristocratic beak of a nose, the crumpled, wide, raveling shirt front, the string tie, with the bow nearly under one ear, were almost exactly duplicated"
8774,"When he performed that marvelous bow that the Major fondly imagined to be the pink of all salutations, the audience sent forth a sudden round of hearty applause"
8775,"Major Talbot, sitting quietly, but white with indignation, heard his best stories retold, his pet theories and hobbies advanced and expanded, and the dream of the Anecdotes and Reminiscences served, exaggerated and garbled"
8776,"The big bays swung to the brow of the hill with ease, and dashed into a small circular clearing, where a quaint little two-story building, with a mossy watering-trough out in front, nestled under the shade of majestic old trees that reared their brown and scarlet crowns proudly into the sky"

8778,Her husband was pink but collected
8779,"The man who first reached the register wrote, in a straight black scrawl, ""J"
8780,"Ralph Ellsworth stalked among the trees, feverishly searching for squirrels, scarlet leaves, and the glint of a brown walking-dress, this last not being so easy to locate in sunlit autumn woods"
8781,"The hat, the hair, the gown, the dainty shoes, even the narrow strip of silken hose that was revealed as she stood a-uptoe, were all of a deep, rich brown that proved an exquisite foil for the pink and cream of her cheeks"
8782,"They will be compelled to compromise, and they must not find me with red eyes"
8783,"The red-hot parlor stove smoked abominably, the pipe carried other smoke out through the hawmow window, only to let it blow back again"
8784,"The landlord was not in the house, but the yellow gleam of a lantern revealed his presence in the woodshed, and Mr. Ellsworth stepped in upon him just as he was pouring something yellow and clear into a tumbler from a big jug that he had just taken from under the flooring"
8785,"One minute later Mr. Van Kamp and Mr. Ellsworth were seated, one on a sawbuck and the other on a nail-keg, comfortably eyeing each other across the work bench, and each was holding up a tumbler one-third filled with the golden yellow liquid"
8786,"A boy in an unnaturally clean, country-laundered collar walked down a long white road"
8787,"The black-eyed boy looked reproach as they clattered up the stairs to Ross's room, where the clean collar was produced and a small stock of ties"
8788,I've got a wad of white chewing-gum;
8789,"""Come on,"" urged the black-eyed boy"
8790,"Abner rose, white and shaking, and thrusting three fingers into the buttoning of his vest, extending the other hand like an orator, proceeded to instruct the freckled, perspiring disciple at his feet"
8791,The hills were red in the west as though a brush fire flamed behind their crests
8792,"The freckle-faced boy was thinking of the village over the hill, a certain pleasant white house set back in a green yard, past whose gate, the two-plank sidewalk ran"
8793,"The boys grew red from the tips of their ears, and as far as any one could see under their wilting collars"
8794,"Abner, who instantly guessed at what was in Ross's mind, turned white at the thought of what they had escaped"
8795,"""They've put us to bed!"" Abner's black eyes flashed fire"
8796,He put in a black face with a grin which divided it from ear to ear
8797,"""We may get a chance yet to call on Champe all by herself out on the porch or in the arbor before she goes to school,"" he suggested, by way of putting some spine into the black-eyed boy"
8798,"Cady insisted on bringing in the cakes herself, and grinned as she whisked her starched blue skirts in and out of the dining-room"
8799,"When the two turned, at bay, yet with nothing between them and liberty but a hypnotism of their own suggestion, they saw the black faces of the servants peering over the family shoulders"
8800,"that his narrow, blue-shaven face was continually chiseled in smiles of complacent self-congratulation"
8801,"When Gideon was on the stage, Stuhk used to enjoy peeping out at the intent, smiling faces of the audience, where men and women and children, hardened theater-goers and folk fresh from the country, sat with moving lips and faces lit with an eager interest and sympathy for the black man strutting in loose-footed vivacity before them"
8802,"There he was, a little black gold-mine, and all of 'em passed him by until I came"
8803,white women talked to him about his career;
8804,"and wherever he went, women of color—black girls, brown girls, yellow girls—wrote him of their admiration, whispered, when he would listen, of their passion and hero-worship"
8805,"Even a few white women, to his horror and embarrassment, had written him of love, letters which he straightway destroyed"
8806,The sullenness still showed in the black face;
8807,"He liked his bills to be of all denominations, and some so large as exquisitely to stagger imagination, others charming by their number and crispness—the dignified, orange paper of a man of assured position and wealth-crackling greenbacks the design of which tinged the whole with actuality"
8808,the one on the left was his own red-lettered announcement for the week;
8809,"Then in abrupt reaction he laughed aloud, so that the shrill, musical falsetto startled the passers-by, and in another moment a little semicircle of the curious watched spellbound as a black man, exquisitely appareled, danced in wild, loose grace before the dull background of a somewhat grimy and apparently vacant window"
8810,"it seemed to Gideon to tremble with the songs of birds, the dry murmur of palm leaves, and the almost inaudible whisper of the gray moss that festooned the live-oaks"
8811,"He bought some oranges of a little, bowlegged black boy, and sat down on a log to eat them and to give up his mind to enjoyment"
8812,"Down the length of the train he saw white passengers from the Pullmans restlessly pacing up and down, getting into their cars and out of them, consulting watches, attaching themselves with gesticulatory expostulation to various officials;"
8813,"He glanced at the orange-colored ""Jim Crow"" with distaste, and inspiration, dawning slowly upon him, swept all other thought before it in its great and growing glory"
8814,"He could catch the dancing blue of it from time to time in ragged vista, and for this beacon he steered directly"
8815,he paused to exchange affectionate mockery with red squirrels;
8816,"This he provisioned with a jug of water, a starch box full of white corn-meal, and a wide strip of lean razorback bacon"
8817,But for the most part his broad black face was turned up to the blue brilliance above him in unblinking contemplation;
8818,"his keen eyes, brilliant despite their sun-muddied whites, reveled in the heights above him, swinging from horizon to horizon in the wake of an orderly file of little bluebill ducks, winging their way across the river, or brightening with interest at the rarer sight of a pair of mallards or redheads, lifting with the soaring circles of the great bald-headed eagle, or following the scattered squadron of heron—white heron, blue heron, young and old, trailing, sunlit, brilliant patches, clear even against the bright white and blue of the sky above them"
8819,"A straggling orange-grove was here, broken lines of vanquished cultivation, struggling little trees swathed and choked in the festooning gray moss, still showing here and there the valiant golden gleam of fruit"
8820,"The moon had risen, and a little breeze waved the hanging moss, and whispered in the glossy foliage of orange and palmetto with a sound like falling rain"
8821,Ef yo' ain' too white to sit down with a black man
8822,"The leaves parted, and a smiling face as black as Gideon's own regarded him in shy amusement"
8823,"She was barefooted, but her blue-checked gingham was clean and belted smartly about a small waist"
8824,"He leaped after her again, running as he had not run in years, in savage, determined pursuit, tearing through brier and scrub, tripping, falling, rising, never losing sight of the blue-clad figure before him until at last she tripped and fell, and he stood panting above her"
8825,"Vashti lay a huddle of blue in the bow, crouched in fear and desolation, shaken and torn with sobbing;"
8826,"all about them the little waves ran glittering in the sunlight, plashing and slapping against the boat's low side, tossing tiny crests to the following wind, showing rifts of white here and there, blowing handfuls of foam and spray"
8827,"He rounded a jutting point, and stretched out a black hand, pointing"
8828,But it would be as reasonable to say that one of those small blue stains which sometimes occur in the purest statuary marble would convert the Eve of Powers to a monster
8829,The flower will wither in a few moments and leave nothing save its brown seed vessels;
8830,"Still, whenever she dared to look into the mirror, there she beheld herself pale as a white rose and with the crimson birthmark stamped upon her cheek"
8831,"On the window seat there stood a geranium diseased with yellow blotches, which had overspread all its leaves"
8832,"And Faith, as the wife was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown"
8833,"""Then God bless you!"" said Faith, with the pink ribbons;"
8834,"and the young man pursued his way until, being about to turn the corner by the meeting-house, he looked back and saw the head of Faith still peeping after him with a melancholy air, in spite of her pink ribbons"
8835,"But the only thing about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff, which bore the likeness of a great black snake, so curiously wrought that it might almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself like a living serpent"
8836,"Yet there was the blue arch, and the stars brightening in it"
8837,"The blue sky was still visible, except directly overhead, where this black mass of cloud was sweeping swiftly northward"
8838,"The young man seized it, and beheld a pink ribbon"
8839,"On he flew among the black pines, brandishing his staff with frenzied gestures, now giving vent to an inspiration of horrid blasphemy, and now shouting forth such laughter as set all the echoes of the forest laughing like demons around him"
8840,"Thus sped the demoniac on his course, until, quivering among the trees, he saw a red light before him, as when the felled trunks and branches of a clearing have been set on fire, and throw up their lurid blaze against the sky, at the hour of midnight"
8841,"As the red light arose and fell, a numerous congregation alternately shone forth, then disappeared in shadow, and again grew, as it were, out of the darkness, peopling the heart of the solitary woods at once"
8842,"Turning the corner by the meeting-house, he spied the head of Faith, with the pink ribbons, gazing anxiously forth, and bursting into such joy at sight of him that she skipped along the street and almost kissed her husband before the whole village"
8843,"When the minister spoke from the pulpit with power and fervid eloquence, and, with his hand on the open Bible, of the sacred truths of our religion, and of saint-like lives and triumphant deaths, and of future bliss or misery unutterable, then did Goodman Brown turn pale, dreading lest the roof should thunder down upon the gray blasphemer and his hearers"
8844,"There was one shrub in particular, set in a marble vase in the midst of the pool, that bore a profusion of purple blossoms, each of which had the lustre and richness of a gem;"
8845,"He was beyond the middle term of life, with gray hair, a thin, gray beard, and a face singularly marked with intellect and cultivation, but which could never, even in his more youthful days, have expressed much warmth of heart"
8846,"When, in his walk through the garden, he came to the magnificent plant that hung its purple gems beside the marble fountain, he placed a kind of mask over his mouth and nostrils, as if all this beauty did but conceal a deadlier malice;"
8847,"What would you?"" cried a rich and youthful voice from the window of the opposite house—a voice as rich as a tropical sunset, and which made Giovanni, though he knew not why, think of deep hues of purple or crimson and of perfumes heavily delectable"
8848,"If the reader be inclined to judge for himself, we refer him to certain black-letter tracts on both sides, preserved in the medical department of the University of Padua"
8849,"In the midst, by the shattered fountain, grew the magnificent shrub, with its purple gems clustering all over it;"
8850,"A small orange-colored reptile, of the lizard or chameleon species, chanced to be creeping along the path, just at the feet of Beatrice"
8851,"""I accept your gift, and would fain recompense it with this precious purple flower;"
8852,"Now, while he was speaking there came a man in black along the street, stooping and moving feebly like a person in inferior health"
8853,"On the back of that hand there was now a purple print like that of four small fingers, and the likeness of a slender thumb upon his wrist"
8854,"for, even should you do violence to my gray hairs, it shall not silence me"
8855,"Giovanni grew white as marble, and stood motionless before the mirror, staring at his own reflection there as at the likeness of something frightful"
8856,My bride looked charmingly in a green silk calash and riding habit of pelisse cloth;
8857,"and whenever her red lips parted with a smile, each tooth appeared like an inestimable pearl"
8858,"Emboldened by her indulgence, I threw back the calash from her polished brow, and suffered my fingers, white and delicate as her own, to stray among those dark and glossy curls which realized my daydreams of rich hair"
8859,for the black neck of a bottle had popped out of the basket
8860,"for this ogre, or whatever it was, had a riding habit like Mrs. Bullfrog's, and also a green silk calash dangling down her back by the strings"
8861,"Such was the red brilliancy of these lamps that they appeared to build walls of fire on both sides of the track, between which we held our course at lightning speed, while a reverberating thunder filled the Valley with its echoes"
8862,"the dealers offering them their purple and fine linen and jewels, the men of wit and humor gibing at them, a pair of buxom ladies ogling them askance, while the benevolent Mr. Smooth-it-away whispered some of his wisdom at their elbows, and pointed to a newly-erected temple;"
8863,"And then did my excellent friend Mr. Smooth-it-away laugh outright, in the midst of which cachinnation a smoke-wreath issued from his mouth and nostrils, while a twinkle of lurid flame darted out of either eye, proving indubitably that his heart was all of a red blaze"
8864,"Of this kind is the gout, which serves as a bond of brotherhood to the purple-visaged gentry, who obey the herald's voice, and painfully hobble from all civilized regions of the globe to take their post in the grand procession"
8865,"The rich man gives a glance at his sable garb in one of the splendid mirrors of his drawing-room, and descending a flight of lofty steps instinctively offers his arm to yonder poverty stricken widow in the rusty black bonnet, and with a check apron over her patched gown"
8866,"This missionary, black with India's burning sunshine, shall give his arm to a pale-faced brother who has made himself familiar with the infected alleys and loathsome haunts of vice in one of our own cities"
8867,"Beggars in their rags, and Kings trailing the regal purple in the dust;"
8868,"Forthwith, however, as soon as the order was given, there was an intense red glow out of the bowl of the pipe, and a whiff of smoke came from Mother Rigby's lips"
8869,"Then the old dame stood the figure up in a corner of her cottage and chuckled to behold its yellow semblance of a visage, with its nobby little nose thrust into the air"
8870,"and as for the countenance, it appeared to shrivel its yellow surface into a grin—a funny kind of expression betwixt scorn and merriment, as if it understood itself to be a jest at mankind"
8871,"Hardly had she spoken, than, just as before, there was a red-glowing coal on the top of the tobacco"
8872,"The shrivelled, yellow face, which heretofore had been no face at all, had already a thin, fantastic haze, as it were of human likeness, shifting to and fro across it;"
8873,else I snatch the pipe from thy mouth and hurl thee where that red coal came from
8874,"Mother Rigby, meanwhile, with one brown arm akimbo and the other stretched towards the figure, loomed grimly amid the obscurity with such port and expression as when she was wont to heave a ponderous nightmare on her victims and stand at the bedside to enjoy their agony"
8875,"And, half revealed among the smoke, a yellow visage bent its lustreless eyes on Mother Rigby"
8876,No sooner said than the intensely red speck of fire was glowing within the pipe-bowl;
8877,"He wore a richly-embroidered plum-colored coat, a waistcoat of costly velvet, magnificently adorned with golden foliage, a pair of splendid scarlet breeches, and the finest and glossiest of white silk stockings"
8878,"""More probably a Spaniard,"" said another, ""and hence his yellow complexion;"
8879,Those settlers in Peru and Mexico have skins as yellow as the gold which they dig out of their mines
8880,"She was a damsel of a soft, round figure, with light hair and blue eyes, and a fair, rosy face, which seemed neither very shrewd nor very simple"
8881,Her nose shall be as red as the coal in thy pipe!
8882,"After an instant or two he beheld the figure of a lean man, of unwholesome look, with glittering eyes and long black hair, who seemed to imitate the motion of a snake;"
8883,"Shortly after Elliston's separation from his wife—now nearly four years ago—his associates had observed a singular gloom spreading over his daily life, like those chill, gray mists that sometimes steal away the sunshine from a summer's morning"
8884,"He summoned the old black servant, who had been bred up in his father's house, and was a middle-aged man while Roderick lay in his cradle"
8885,"At another time, he stopped a close-fisted old fellow, of great wealth, but who skulked about the city in the guise of a scarecrow, with a patched blue surtout, brown hat, and mouldy boots, scraping pence together, and picking up rusty nails"
8886,"But nothing seemed to please Roderick better than to lay hold of a person infected with jealousy, which he represented as an enormous green reptile, with an ice-cold length of body, and the sharpest sting of any snake save one"
8887,In solitude his melancholy grew more black and sullen
8888,"Into this retirement the sculptor and his companion were ushered by Scipio, the old black servant, whose wrinkled visage grew almost sunny with intelligence and joy as he paid his humble greetings to one of the two visitors"
8889,"Here,""—pointing to a staring, half-length figure, in a white wig and scarlet coat,—""here is an excellent model, the likeness of our gracious king"
8890,"The carver, still in the same secrecy that marked all his operations upon this mysterious image, proceeded to paint the habiliments in their proper colors, and the countenance with Nature's red and white"
8891,"He was stylishly dressed in a blue broadcloth coat, with gold lace at the seams and button-holes, an embroidered scarlet waistcoat, a triangular hat, with a loop and broad binding of gold, and wore a silver-hilted hanger at his side"
8892,The deep lines of his countenance and the scattered gray of his hair marked him as past the middle age;
8893,"And for a monument, here is this gray rock, on which my dying hand shall carve the name of Roger Malvin, and the traveller in days to come will know that here sleeps a hunter and a warrior"
8894,"but inwardly there was a cold cold sorrow, which he compared to the snowdrifts lying deep in the glens and hollows of the rivulets while the leaves were brightly green above"
8895,"Her employment, diversified by an occasional glance at the pot, now beginning to simmer over the blaze, was the perusal of the current year's Massachusetts Almanac, which, with the exception of an old black-letter Bible, comprised all the literary wealth of the family"
8896,"Reuben remembered how the little banner had fluttered on that topmost bough, when it was green and lovely, eighteen years before"
8897,"Moving about in this red glare and alternate dusk was the figure of the blacksmith, well worthy to be viewed in so picturesque an aspect of light and shade, where the bright blaze struggled with the black night, as if each would have snatched his comely strength from the other"
8898,"Anon he drew a white-hot bar of iron from the coals, laid it on the anvil, uplifted his arm of might, and was soon enveloped in the myriads of sparks which the strokes of his hammer scattered into the surrounding gloom"
8899,"She did so, but almost screamed as a butterfly fluttered forth, and, alighting on her finger's tip, sat waving the ample magnificence of its purple and gold-speckled wings, as if in prelude to a flight"
8900,"but it glistened apparently by its own radiance, and illuminated the finger and outstretched hand on which it rested with a white gleam like that of precious stones"
8901,"Even the bright spots of gold upon its wings and body, unless her eyes deceived her, grew dim, and the glowing purple took a dusky hue, and the starry lustre that gleamed around the blacksmith's hand became faint and vanished"
8902,"There were five pink paper roses twisted in the veil, and eleven bright green rose leaves"
8903,"There were new white cotton gloves upon her hands, and as she stood staring about her she twisted them together feverishly"
8904,"and she had just been married—and married to Jurgis, of all men, to Jurgis Rudkus, he with the white flower in the buttonhole of his new black suit, he with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands"
8905,"Ona was blue-eyed and fair, while Jurgis had great black eyes with beetling brows, and thick black hair that curled in waves about his ears—in short, they were one of those incongruous and impossible married couples with which Mother Nature so often wills to confound all prophets, before and after"
8906,"To the right there is a door from the saloon, with a few loafers in the doorway, and in the corner beyond it a bar, with a presiding genius clad in soiled white, with waxed black mustaches and a carefully oiled curl plastered against one side of his forehead"
8907,"At the head, where sits the bride, is a snow-white cake, with an Eiffel tower of constructed decoration, with sugar roses and two angels upon it, and a generous sprinkling of pink and green and yellow candies"
8908,"and half a minute later there appears old Grandmother Majauszkiene, with a big yellow bowl of smoking potatoes, nearly as big as herself"
8909,"” He is in his shirt sleeves, with a vest figured with faded gold horseshoes, and a pink-striped shirt, suggestive of peppermint candy"
8910,"A pair of military trousers, light blue with a yellow stripe, serve to give that suggestion of authority proper to the leader of a band"
8911,"The second violin is a Slovak, a tall, gaunt man with black-rimmed spectacles and the mute and patient look of an overdriven mule;"
8912,"Chicago and its saloons and its slums fade away—there are green meadows and sunlit rivers, mighty forests and snow-clad hills"
8913,"and as she is ashamed to wipe them away, and ashamed to let them run down her cheeks, she turns and shakes her head a little, and then flushes red when she sees that Jurgis is watching her"
8914,"She has a broad Slavic face, with prominent red cheeks"
8915,"She wears a blue flannel shirt-waist, which is now rolled up at the sleeves, disclosing her brawny arms;"
8916,"She wears a white shirtwaist, which represents, perhaps, half a week’s labor painting cans"
8917,She wears an old white dress which she has made herself and worn to parties for the past five years;
8918,"His body shakes and throbs like a runaway steam engine, and the ear cannot follow the flying showers of notes—there is a pale blue mist where you look to see his bowing arm"
8919,"provided that once in his lifetime he might testify to the fact that life, with all its cares and its terrors, is no such great thing after all, but merely a bubble upon the surface of a river, a thing that one may toss about and play with as a juggler tosses his golden balls, a thing that one may quaff, like a goblet of rare red wine"
8920,"Each time, Marija would emit a howl and fly at them, shaking her fists in their faces, stamping upon the floor, purple and incoherent with rage"
8921,"Little Sebastijonas, aged three, had been wandering about oblivious to all things, holding turned up over his mouth a bottle of liquid known as “pop,” pink-colored, ice-cold, and delicious"
8922,"Jurgis listened in silence, with his great black eyebrows knitted"
8923,"It does not, and finally he will wait no longer, but comes up to Ona, who turns white and trembles"
8924,"but here, without ever having spoken a word to her, with no more than the exchange of half a dozen smiles, he found himself, purple in the face with embarrassment and terror, asking her parents to sell her to him for his wife—and offering his father’s two horses he had been sent to the fair to sell"
8925,"This happened to them again in New York—for, of course, they knew nothing about the country, and had no one to tell them, and it was easy for a man in a blue uniform to lead them away, and to take them to a hotel and keep them there, and make them pay enormous charges to get away"
8926,"they stood staring down the vista of Dearborn Street, with its big black buildings towering in the distance, unable to realize that they had arrived, and why, when they said “Chicago,” people no longer pointed in some direction, but instead looked perplexed, or laughed, or went on without paying any attention"
8927,"half a dozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings, touching the very sky—and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily, and black as night"
8928,"then, uniting in one giant river, they streamed away down the sky, stretching a black pall as far as the eye could reach"
8929,"One never saw the fields, nor any green thing whatever, in Packingtown;"
8930,"These bare places were grown up with dingy, yellow weeds, hiding innumerable tomato cans;"
8931,"there were no pavements—there were mountains and valleys and rivers, gullies and ditches, and great hollows full of stinking green water"
8932,The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky;
8933,in the sunset light it was black and brown and gray and purple
8934,"Red cattle, black, white, and yellow cattle;"
8935,"” In front of Brown’s General Office building there grows a tiny plot of grass, and this, you may learn, is the only bit of green thing in Packingtown;"
8936,"Some were white hogs, some were black;"
8937,"And trusting and strong in faith he had gone about his business, the while a black shadow hung over him and a horrid Fate waited in his pathway"
8938,"This inspector wore a blue uniform, with brass buttons, and he gave an atmosphere of authority to the scene, and, as it were, put the stamp of official approval upon the things which were done in Durham’s"
8939,"and before you could realize it, the man had darted on to the next line, and a stream of bright red was pouring out upon the floor"
8940,"The roof of it was of a purple hue, and trimmed with gold;"
8941,"it was complete in every tiniest detail, even the doorknob, and there was a hammock on the porch and white lace curtains in the windows"
8942,"The street in front of the house was unpaved and unlighted, and the view from it consisted of a few exactly similar houses, scattered here and there upon lots grown up with dingy brown weeds"
8943,"a parlor set of four pieces, a bedroom set of three pieces, a dining room table and four chairs, a toilet set with beautiful pink roses painted all over it, an assortment of crockery, also with pink roses—and so on"
8944,"She would have ready a great pot full of steaming black coffee, and oatmeal and bread and smoked sausages;"
8945,you could see a red stain wherever he had spit upon the floor
8946,"The cruelest thing of all was that nearly all of them—all of those who used knives—were unable to wear gloves, and their arms would be white with frost and their hands would grow numb, and then of course there would be accidents"
8947,"a grisly thing, a specter born in the black caverns of terror;"
8948,"There was no place to entertain company except in the kitchen, in the midst of the family, and Tamoszius would sit there with his hat between his knees, never saying more than half a dozen words at a time, and turning red in the face before he managed to say those;"
8949,"And forthwith the soul of him would flame up and become eloquent—it was almost an impropriety, for all the while his gaze would be fixed upon Marija’s face, until she would begin to turn red and lower her eyes"
8950,"So each man in turn took an oath of which he did not understand a word, and then was presented with a handsome ornamented document with a big red seal and the shield of the United States upon it, and was told that he had become a citizen of the Republic and the equal of the President himself"
8951,there could be no describing this—the houses would be black with them
8952,"Perhaps the summertime suggests to you thoughts of the country, visions of green fields and mountains and sparkling lakes"
8953,"The great packing machine ground on remorselessly, without thinking of green fields;"
8954,"and the men and women and children who were part of it never saw any green thing, not even a flower"
8955,Four or five miles to the east of them lay the blue waters of Lake Michigan;
8956,"Worse than this, the woman lived in a bawdy-house downtown, with a coarse, red-faced Irishman named Connor, who was the boss of the loading-gang outside, and would make free with the girls as they went to and from their work"
8957,"He had the brightest little black eyes, and little black ringlets all over his head;"
8958,"but Ona had to go to work, and leave him for Teta Elzbieta to feed upon the pale blue poison that was called milk at the corner grocery"
8959,"One of the girls had read somewhere that a red flag was the proper symbol for oppressed workers, and so they mounted one, and paraded all about the yards, yelling with rage"
8960,"At the end of it the girl who had carried the red flag went downtown and got a position in a great department store, at a salary of two dollars and a half a week"
8961,"Once it was eleven o’clock at night, and black as the pit, but still they got home"
8962,"Then he gripped the sides of the bed, and shut his teeth together, and turned white with agony, while the doctor pulled and wrenched away at his swollen ankle"
8963,"The poor fellow looked like a homeless ghost, with his cheeks sunken in and his long black hair straggling into his eyes;"
8964,"And now the winter was over, and the spring winds were blowing—and with a day’s walk a man might put the smoke of Packingtown behind him forever, and be where the grass was green and the flowers all the colors of the rainbow!"
8965,"and Jurgis being still obdurate, Elzbieta went in tears and begged the money from the neighbors, and so little Kristoforas had a mass and a hearse with white plumes on it, and a tiny plot in a graveyard with a wooden cross to mark the place"
8966,"In the dust and the steam the electric lights would shine like far-off twinkling stars—red and blue-green and purple stars, according to the color of the mist and the brew from which it came"
8967,"On top of this were the rooms where they dried the “tankage,” the mass of brown stringy stuff that was left after the waste portions of the carcasses had had the lard and tallow dried out of them"
8968,"This dried material they would then grind to a fine powder, and after they had mixed it up well with a mysterious but inoffensive brown rock which they brought in and ground up by the hundreds of carloads for that purpose, the substance was ready to be put into bags and sent out to the world as any one of a hundred different brands of standard bone phosphate"
8969,"Before him was one of the vents of the mill in which the fertilizer was being ground—rushing forth in a great brown river, with a spray of the finest dust flung forth in clouds"
8970,"He looked like a brown ghost at twilight—from hair to shoes he became the color of the building and of everything in it, and for that matter a hundred yards outside it"
8971,"The people who worked here followed the ancient custom of nature, whereby the ptarmigan is the color of dead leaves in the fall and of snow in the winter, and the chameleon, who is black when he lies upon a stump and turns green when he moves to a leaf"
8972,"Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"
8973,"Poor little Antanas, for instance—who had never failed to win him with a smile—little Antanas was not smiling just now, being a mass of fiery red pimples"
8974,"in the daytime he was a thing uncanny and impish to behold, a plaster of pimples and sweat, a great purple lump of misery"
8975,"and then, because it was nearly eight o’clock, and they would lose another hour if they delayed, he left her at the packing house door, with her ghastly white face and her haunted eyes of terror"
8976,"That rusty black hat with the drooping red flower, it might not be Ona’s, but there was very little likelihood of it"
8977,"She had her hands clasped tightly in her lap, and he saw that her face was as white as paper, and drawn with pain"
8978,"He was a big, red-faced Irishman, coarse-featured, and smelling of liquor"
8979,"He was exhausted and half-dazed, and besides he saw the blue uniforms of the policemen"
8980,"and then within the soul of him there rose up a fiend, red-eyed and cruel, and tore out the strings of his heart"
8981,"Along with them he was driven into a large, white-walled room, stale-smelling and crowded"
8982,"In front, upon a raised platform behind a rail, sat a stout, florid-faced personage, with a nose broken out in purple blotches"
8983,"There were two bunks, one above the other, each with a straw mattress and a pair of gray blankets—the latter stiff as boards with filth, and alive with fleas, bedbugs, and lice"
8984,"and it came to him as if it had been yesterday—himself a little child, with his lost brother and his dead father in the cabin—in the deep black forest, where the snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the world"
8985,"In one window there would be live geese, in another marvels in sugar—pink and white canes big enough for ogres, and cakes with cherubs upon them;"
8986,"in a third there would be rows of fat yellow turkeys, decorated with rosettes, and rabbits and squirrels hanging;"
8987,"in a fourth would be a fairyland of toys—lovely dolls with pink dresses, and woolly sheep and drums and soldier hats"
8988,"The last time they had had a big basket with them and all their Christmas marketing to do—a roast of pork and a cabbage and some rye bread, and a pair of mittens for Ona, and a rubber doll that squeaked, and a little green cornucopia full of candy to be hung from the gas jet and gazed at by half a dozen pairs of longing eyes"
8989,"Their justice—it was a lie, it was a lie, a hideous, brutal lie, a thing too black and hateful for any world but a world of nightmares"
8990,"He was a dapper young fellow, with a light brown mustache and blue eyes, and a graceful figure"
8991,"they were black and white, old and young, Americans and natives of every nation under the sun"
8992,"These streets were huge canyons formed by towering black buildings, echoing with the clang of car gongs and the shouts of drivers;"
8993,"He came again to the slum districts, to avenues of saloons and cheap stores, with long dingy red factory buildings, and coal-yards and railroad tracks;"
8994,"So he came at last to the stockyards, to the black volcanoes of smoke and the lowing cattle and the stench"
8995,it had been gray and now it was yellow!
8996,"The trimmings around the windows had been red, and now they were green!"
8997,"New, white curtains, stiff and shiny!"
8998,He turned white and clung more tightly to the railing
8999,"She had shrunk all up with her rheumatism since Jurgis had seen her last, and her yellow parchment face stared up at him from a little above the level of the doorknob"
9000,"When he tried to knock upon it, it swung open the rest of the way, and he had a glimpse of her, with a black bottle turned up to her lips"
9001,"She wore a filthy blue wrapper, and her teeth were black"
9002,"Then there was a black bonnet which had to be adjusted carefully, and an umbrella which was mislaid, and a bag full of necessaries which had to be collected from here and there—the man being nearly crazy with anxiety in the meantime"
9003,"The saloon-keeper gazed at him, with his haggard white face and his blue trembling lips"
9004,"and then, after trying to speak his gratitude, he went and sat down by the big red stove in the middle of the room"
9005,"It was four o’clock in the morning, and as black as night"
9006,"Jurgis gave one glance at her, and then turned white and reeled"
9007,"she was so shrunken he would scarcely have known her—she was all but a skeleton, and as white as a piece of chalk"
9008,The gray dawn came up and crept into the attic
9009,"The priest left, the women left, and he was alone with the still, white figure—quieter now, but moaning and shuddering, wrestling with the grisly fiend"
9010,"Now and then he would raise himself and stare at the white mask before him, then hide his eyes because he could not bear it"
9011,"a blast of cold and snow rushed in, and behind it little Kotrina, breathless from running, and blue with the cold"
9012,"In other places all these various parts were dipped into troughs of paint and hung up to dry, and then slid along on trolleys to a room where men streaked them with red and yellow, so that they might look cheerful in the harvest fields"
9013,He shoveled black sand into an iron receptacle and pounded it tight and set it aside to harden;
9014,"his arms working like the driving rods of an engine, his long, black hair flying wild, his eyes starting out, the sweat rolling in rivers down his face"
9015,Far and wide the sky was flaring with the red glare that leaped from rows of towering chimneys—for it was pitch dark when Jurgis arrived
9016,"Soon after daybreak whistles began to blow, and then suddenly thousands of men appeared, streaming from saloons and boardinghouses across the way, leaping from trolley cars that passed—it seemed as if they rose out of the ground, in the dim gray light"
9017,"towering, black buildings here and there, long rows of shops and sheds, little railways branching everywhere, bare gray cinders underfoot and oceans of billowing black smoke above"
9018,"where miniature steam engines came rushing upon him, and sizzling, quivering, white-hot masses of metal sped past him, and explosions of fire and flaming sparks dazzled him and scorched his face"
9019,"The men in these mills were all black with soot, and hollow-eyed and gaunt;"
9020,"Jurgis stood where the balcony of the theater would have been, and opposite, by the stage, he saw three giant caldrons, big enough for all the devils of hell to brew their broth in, full of something white and blinding, bubbling and splashing, roaring as if volcanoes were blowing through it—one had to shout to be heard in the place"
9021,"there fell a pillar of white flame, dazzling as the sun, swishing like a huge tree falling in the forest"
9022,"and then Jurgis looked through the fingers of his hands, and saw pouring out of the caldron a cascade of living, leaping fire, white with a whiteness not of earth, scorching the eyeballs"
9023,"and Jurgis heard a toot behind him, and jumped out of the way of a car with a white-hot ingot upon it, the size of a man’s body"
9024,"By and by it was long and thin, a great red snake escaped from purgatory;"
9025,"There was a row of brick furnaces, shining white through every crack with the molten steel inside"
9026,"Some of these were bulging dangerously, yet men worked before them, wearing blue glasses when they opened and shut the doors"
9027,"One of these papers was as good as a circus, and nearly as good as a spree—certainly a most wonderful treat for a workingman, who was tired out and stupefied, and had never had any education, and whose work was one dull, sordid grind, day after day, and year after year, with never a sight of a green field nor an hour’s entertainment, nor anything but liquor to stimulate his imagination"
9028,"He even scrubbed his head with sand, and combed what the men called “crumbs” out of his long, black hair, holding his head under water as long as he could, to see if he could not kill them all"
9029,"and then out of the rear part of the saloon a girl’s face, red-cheeked and merry, smiled at Jurgis, and his heart thumped suddenly in his throat"
9030,"He was about a year old, and a sturdy little fellow, with soft fat legs, and a round ball of a stomach, and eyes as black as coals"
9031,"He went on and on down the road, finally coming to a black woods, where he hid and wept as if his heart would break"
9032,"If he drank now and then he was free to make himself at home, to gamble with dice or a pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for money, or to look at a beer-stained pink “sporting paper,” with pictures of murderers and half-naked women"
9033,"There were three elderly gentlemen in black upon the platform, and a young lady who played the piano in front"
9034,"First they sang a hymn, and then one of the three, a tall, smooth-shaven man, very thin, and wearing black spectacles, began an address"
9035,"What did he know about sin and suffering—with his smooth, black coat and his neatly starched collar, his body warm, and his belly full, and money in his pocket—and lecturing men who were struggling for their lives, men at the death grapple with the demon powers of hunger and cold!—This, of course, was unfair;"
9036,"When he saw a blue-coat start toward him, however, his heart failed him, and he dashed down a side street and fled a couple of blocks"
9037,"A man in blue livery stood holding it, and gazing before him, silent as a statue"
9038,"Then Jurgis felt his companion pulling, and he stepped in, and the blue automaton closed the door"
9039,"The floor was of tesselated marble, smooth as glass, and from the walls strange shapes loomed out, woven into huge portieres in rich, harmonious colors, or gleaming from paintings, wonderful and mysterious-looking in the half-light, purple and red and golden, like sunset glimmers in a shadowy forest"
9040,"Then his eye passed to the long table in the center of the hall, a table black as ebony, and gleaming with wrought silver and gold"
9041,"In the center of it was a huge carven bowl, with the glistening gleam of ferns and the red and purple of rare orchids, glowing from a light hidden somewhere in their midst"
9042,"There were cold pates, and thin slices of meat, tiny bread and butter sandwiches with the crust cut off, a bowl of sliced peaches and cream (in January), little fancy cakes, pink and green and yellow and white, and half a dozen ice-cold bottles of wine"
9043,"Then the prisoner was sworn—a forlorn object, haggard and unshorn, with an arm done up in a filthy bandage, a cheek and head cut, and bloody, and one eye purplish black and entirely closed"
9044,"the green-goods man and the highwayman, the pickpocket and the sneak thief, and the receiver of stolen goods, the seller of adulterated milk, of stale fruit and diseased meat, the proprietor of unsanitary tenements, the fake doctor and the usurer, the beggar and the “pushcart man,” the prize fighter and the professional slugger, the race-track “tout,” the procurer, the white-slave agent, and the expert seducer of young girls"
9045,"One night it chanced that while Jack Duane was drilling a safe in a clothing store he was caught red-handed by the night watchman, and turned over to a policeman, who chanced to know him well, and who took the responsibility of letting him make his escape"
9046,“How do you mean?” And Jurgis turned red with embarrassment
9047,"and there was a brass band, which marched through the streets, and fireworks and bombs and red lights in front of the hall;"
9048,"The chairman was still more worried when the monster torchlight procession came off, with the members of the Doyle Republican Association all in red capes and hats, and free beer for every voter in the ward—the best beer ever given away in a political campaign, as the whole electorate testified"
9049,"” Jurgis had long ago cast off his fertilizer clothing, and since going into politics he had donned a linen collar and a greasy red necktie"
9050,"While he stood listening, smiling cynically, several dapper young men stood by with notebooks in their hands, and it was not more than two hours later that Jurgis saw newsboys running about with armfuls of newspapers, printed in red and black letters six inches high:"
9051,"It was a weird sight, there on the killing beds—a throng of stupid black Negroes, and foreigners who could not understand a word that was said to them, mixed with pale-faced, hollow-chested bookkeepers and clerks, half-fainting for the tropical heat and the sickening stench of fresh blood—and all struggling to dress a dozen or two cattle in the same place where, twenty-four hours ago, the old killing gang had been speeding, with their marvelous precision, turning out four hundred carcasses every hour!"
9053,"and any night, in the big open space in front of Brown’s, one might see brawny Negroes stripped to the waist and pounding each other for money, while a howling throng of three or four thousand surged about, men and women, young white girls from the country rubbing elbows with big buck Negroes with daggers in their boots, while rows of woolly heads peered down from every window of the surrounding factories"
9054,The ancestors of these black people had been savages in Africa;
9055,"and there were not merely rivers of hot blood, and car-loads of moist flesh, and rendering vats and soap caldrons, glue factories and fertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hell—there were also tons of garbage festering in the sun, and the greasy laundry of the workers hung out to dry, and dining rooms littered with food and black with flies, and toilet rooms that were open sewers"
9056,"but then around the corner one might see a bonfire blazing, and an old, gray-headed Negress, lean and witchlike, her hair flying wild and her eyes blazing, yelling and chanting of the fires of perdition and the blood of the “Lamb,” while men and women lay down upon the ground and moaned and screamed in convulsions of terror and remorse"
9057,"He was still muttering this when suddenly, at the corner, he came upon a green-grocery, with a tray full of cabbages in front of it"
9058,"And then, through the rain and the darkness, far down the street he saw red lights flaring and heard the thumping of a bass drum;"
9059,"and the next moment she sprang back, and past him, her eyes shining white with terror, and bounded up the stairway, screaming at the top of her lungs:"
9060,"Then, seeing blue-coated forms rushing upon him, he sprang after the Negress"
9061,"One black-eyed young girl perched herself upon the top of the balustrade, and began to kick with her slippered foot at the helmets of the policemen, until one of them caught her by the ankle and pulled her down"
9062,"one of them, who wore a bright red kimono, shouted and screamed in a voice that drowned out all the other sounds in the hall—and Jurgis took a glance at her, and then gave a start, and a cry, “Marija!”"
9063,"There were old men and young men, college boys and gray-beards old enough to be their grandfathers;"
9064,"But they were far-off and shadowy, and the gulf between them was black and bottomless;"
9065,"her complexion was in reality a parchment yellow, and there were black rings under her eyes"
9066,"Did you notice that little French girl with the yellow hair, that stood next to me in the court?”"
9067,"but fancy a woman selling herself to every kind of man that comes, old or young, black or white—and doing it because she likes to!”"
9068,"There was no red fire and no band now, but there was a sign out, announcing a meeting, and a stream of people pouring in through the entrance"
9069,"a thin black beard covered half of his face, and one could see only two black hollows where the eyes were"
9070,"and now, suddenly, in one awful convulsion, the black and hideous fact was made plain to him!"
9071,"There was a falling in of all the pillars of his soul, the sky seemed to split above him—he stood there, with his clenched hands upraised, his eyes bloodshot, and the veins standing out purple in his face, roaring in the voice of a wild beast, frantic, incoherent, maniacal"
9072,"He had deep, black eyes, and a face full of gentleness and pain"
9073,"He had on a long-tailed black coat, worn green at the seams and the buttonholes;"
9074,"his eyes must have been weak, for he wore green spectacles that gave him a grotesque appearance"
9075,it had hoisted the black flag and declared war upon civilization
9076,"” “Tommy” Hinds, as he was known to his intimates, was a squat little man, with broad shoulders and a florid face, decorated with gray side whiskers"
9077,"In Massachusetts the percentage of white illiteracy is eight-tenths of one per cent, while in South Carolina it is thirteen and six-tenths per cent;"
9078,” Her eyelids looked heavy and her face was red and swollen;
9079,"The room that Jurgis saw was half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly visible in the soft, yellow light;"
9080,"Nicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands and bristling yellow beard;"
9081,Do you think that it would be too much to say that two hours of the working time of every efficient member of a community goes to feed the red fiend of war?”
9082,"When all but her chemise was removed, she stopped to pick up her petticoats that she had allowed to fall to her feet, and in lifting them, raised also her chemise, and exposed to my view a most glorious bottom—dazzlingly white and shining like satin"
9083,"Her close and tight-fitting white stockings displayed her well-formed legs, for while confined to the house during our morning lessons she did not wear drawers;"
9084,"I thus had the intoxicating delight of gazing on all her beautiful charms, for when she tucked up her clothes she stood before her glass, presenting to my devouring glance her glorious white bottom in all its fullness, turning to approach the bidet, she equally exposed her lower belly and beautiful mount, with all its wealth of hair"
9085,"When her ablutions were completed, she sat down and drew off her stockings, displaying her beautiful white calves and charming little feet"
9086,"Cut succeeded cut, yell succeeded yell—until the rod was worn to a stump, and poor Mary’s bottom was one mass of weals and red as raw beef"
9087,"Mrs. Benson lay for a few minutes longer all exposed, her quim more open than before, and I could see a white slime oozing from it"
9088,"Miss Evelyn turned the key in the door, opened a cupboard, and withdrew a birch rod neatly tied up with blue ribbons"
9089,Her silk dress was drawn up to prevent its being creased—my naked flesh pressed against her snowy white petticoats
9090,A delicate perfume of violet and vervain assailed my nerves
9091,"When I applied my lips to the delicious gap, I found that she had the most beautiful silky light curls running up to and around her charming pink bottom-hole, and losing themselves in the chink between the buttocks"
9092,"Her smooth, glossy, and abundant hair, arranged in braids, was neatly fastened in under a coquettish lace cap with pretty blue ribbons"
9093,I placed myself on her beautiful smooth and white belly and pressed against the hair of her mount
9094,"Her skin was white as milk, and dazzlingly fair and smooth"
9095,"“Why it is as hard as wood, and see how red its head is"
9096,"Seeing that her chemise fell off from her bosom, I first felt her little bubbies, which were beginning to develop themselves, and had the tiniest little pink nipples that even my lips could hardly get hold of"
9097,"She told me this was necessary to prevent any recurrence, and also that in some cases a virulent white discharge occasionally followed for some hours, sufficiently acrid to affect my local health, and “that,” she added, “was now too precious in her estimation to risk it in any way"
9098,"At last Miss Evelyn joined me, her eyes were swollen and red as if she had been weeping;"
9099,"I afterwards found the reason of this was that her arms were so black with thick hair that she was ashamed to let them be seen, although, in reality, beautifully formed and plump"
9100,"I kissed the dear red buttocks that were all covered with weals and looked like raw beef, but no blood had been drawn"
9101,"it was as black as coal, and shone as if polished in all its beautiful curls"
9102,"That evening I kept awake, and again enjoyed the superb display of Miss Frankland’s wonderfully hairy cunt, all the lower part of her body was as black as a chimney sweeper’s"
9103,"But what at the moment most astonished me, and drew all my attention, was to see a deep red clitoris standing out from the upper part of her cunt quite stiff, and as long and as thick as the middle finger of a man"
9104,"Her position brought out all the beauties of the vast wide-spread mass of black curly hair that thickly covered all the lower part of her magnificent quim, ran down each thigh, up between her buttocks, and opening out on her back, had two bunches just below the two beautiful dimples that were so charmingly developed below her waist"
9105,"For my part, seeing her wonderful clitoris, stiff standing out of the bright red lips of her luscious cunt, I took it bodily into my mouth, sucked it, and rolled my tongue about it, to the evident delight of my salacious companion"
9106,"And, lifting up her petticoat and chemise, she exposed, to the absolute astonishment of Lizzie, her extraordinary mass of hair, and her fiery red clitoris glowing and sticking out of its black mass of curls"
9107,Her eyes were of a deep blue that could look very far into you
9108,"She had a very pleasing expression, a small mouth, and very white teeth"
9109,"“Now I must put you in pickle, but as your great red buttocks are too large to be pickled, I shall pickle your prick instead"
9110,"This she immediately did, and being directly before my eyes, I had a full front view of her gloriously large wide-open cunt, and all the pinky brown aureola around her charming bottom-hole, over which the little fair ringlets showed in great beauty"
9111,Her exquisitely creamy white skin began to see the scarlet of the blood rushing to the surface under the infliction received
9112,"He then knelt, and presenting a really beautifully rounded bottom of the fairest hue, he pushed it out, showing a light brown corrugated bum-hole, most tempting to look at"
9113,"I moved a few times in and out, so that my prick was white with the foam of her delicious cunt"
9114,"I spent before the doctor could quite get his prick to standing point, but the copious torrent I poured into his mouth, and his after-suction on my prick, in addition to the red raw state of his buttocks, at last brought him up to full stand"
9115,"Her shift had somehow worked upwards, and revealed all the charms of her delicate young bum and plump white thighs"
9116,"He crept up noiselessly quite close to her, and, stooping down until his head was below the level of her raised petticoat, he feasted his eyes for some time with the lovely prospect before him, her little virgin rosebud slit, its pink and pouting lips, plump little mount already delicately shaded with a curly foliage that promised soon to be much more dense, together with the swell of her lovely young thighs and calves"
9117,"The tight foreskin had closed below the nut, and left the now fiery red head bursting with excitement, and visibly throbbing with intensity of passion"
9118,"To her great surprise she beheld the so lately rampant weapon drooping its head and withdrawing within its shell, while some few drops of a milky white creamy like liquid were slowly oozing from the small orifice off its head"
9119,"He thought but of her, of her lovely pink little slit so sweetly shaded with soft downy short curls;"
9120,"The doctor then lowered down Dale’s trousers, and raising his shirt, contemplated with great pleasure the pretty belly of the lovely boy, and then turning him round, under pretence of seeing if the weals of the last flogging were still visible, he gazed on his white firm backside and swelling thighs, examining the marks still left from the previous punishment"
9121,"The boy’s bottom was now red with a glowing heat, and his cock was in a state of intense excitement, and the doctor’s tool was as stiff and randy as possible"
9122,"He was quite charming to look at, his young and throbbing prick was deliciously fair, and you could see the blue veins coursing through it, the top was only partially uncovered, the point of the head showing its vermillion tip in fine contrast to the creamy white and crossed blue veins of the stiffened shaft"
9123,"We got up, and she turned herself round in every way for me to see the rare beauties of her person—herself explaining to me where she was well made—bosom, buttocks, belly so white and smooth, without a wrinkle, although she had had a son"
9124,"Her bosom, without being so large as aunt’s, was gloriously white and firm, with such pink nipples, larger than in a maid, but sticking out hard and inviting a suck"
9125,"Of course I did so, admiring not only their size and fairness, but also the beautiful curly silk meshes that ran between the cheeks, covered her beautifully pink bottom-hole, charmingly puckered as it was, and ran up to the flat of her back"
9126,"I had thrust three fingers into her cunt, and when I found she had thrust hers into my bottom, I transferred them all into her beautiful pink bum-hole"
9127,"Then gently drawing her down upon me, I folded one arm round her slender waist, and turning my head, found that the cheval glass, inclined forward, reflected as it were from above her beautiful bottom and back, and of course her cunt stretched to the utmost with my huge prick, and above it the sweet little corrugated pink aperture of her bottom"
9128,"Jane was fair, Ann was dark, with black locks and black hairy cunt—a very long cunt, with a small tight hole in it, and above it a wide-spread projecting mount, splendidly furnished with hair"
9129,Her mount was covered with closely curled brown silky locks;
9130,"Her clitoris stood out quite three inches, red and stiff"
9131,"He was very hairy all up the chink of his arse, and had a very coarse skin and an almost black arsehole, so deep a brown it was, the very sight of which always drove me mad with lust"
9132,"The glorious and wonderfully hairy body of the Frankland perfectly astonished them, and raised their tribadic passions to fever heat, especially the Benson, who threw herself on that glorious form in an ecstasy of delight, more especially as the Frankland’s passions being excited, her long red clitoris stood out from the dense black mass of hair which covered not only her belly and mount, but all down and around her cunt"
9133,"her long red clitoris, not satisfied with the double rack-off with the Count, appeared only to be more excited, and stirred the whole soul of the adorable Benson"
9134,and my red excoriated arse excited and renewed his very fine prick;
9135,"Her bubbies were superb, and stood firmly apart, face charming with lovely and lovable blue eyes, full of the sparkle of lust;"
9136,"lips red and moist, inviting a tongue"
9137,"In this I differed greatly from our dear friend MacCallum, who loved the delicate unfledged arseholes of youths, while to me it was necessary to be the very reverse of the fair sex, whose arseholes in general are of a delicate pink with puckered-up charming little orifices, which, of course, have their charm;"
9138,"His prick was exquisitely white, and the blue veins showed themselves coursing through in a most tempting way—it was seven and a half inches long, by quite six in circumference, was thick up to the vermilion nut, although gently diminishing from the roots, the glans was smaller than the shaft close up to it;"
9139,"His exquisitely white buttocks, marble-like in polish, hardness, and coldness to the touch, were most attractive to women as well as to me"
9140,and a black deed was reported in the traditions of the peasantry around
9141,"As to your brown cloak which II gave you, &c"
9142,"When I have worked you in this way for hours, ceasing every moment you were on the point of emission, I should, as I withdrew my member, let you at last discharge, and then an immense stream of love would flow into my mouth, which suddenly and as if by enchantment would find itself in the place of my member while your bosoms would be covered with that white essence of which you are the only source in my eyes (I had never known it before Homburg), and which would escape from my amorous member"
9143,"My languishing eyes, gentle as love itself, surrounded by large dark blue circles caused by your look, your tongue, your bosom, your cunt, your member, your heavenly little bottom, your legs, your fingers, and your angelic little feet would tell you how complete was my happiness, my intoxication, my ecstasy, and my faint, exhausted but happy voice would give you the same assurance, would murmur with rapture in your ears—“Oh how I love you, my lady love, my divine little virgin, caress me yet once more, again, still again, it is a dream"
9144,"Then, more full of passion than ever woman lover had ever been, and enraptured as you listened to my voice, so completely beneath your sway, listening only to your own love, you would raise your little coquettish petticoat, and pressing dear little loves of calves more closely together, for you could be on your knees, resting upon my little blue veins, you would frig me in this manner, with greater vigour than ever sitting down every now and then upon your fine little heels, in order the better to release my beautiful prick, perfectly straight and rudely swollen and inflamed with passionate desires, from between your divine thighs, as soft as satin, and as white as snow, to better introduce the wet tips of your lovely and velvet like bosoms into the seductive little hole of my member, whilst my knees raised slightly behind would gently caress your bottom, so as to give you some little satisfaction in your turn;"
9145,"Then I should give you your dessert, which would consist of a biscuit moistened with that white essence which you alone in the whole world have known and know how to produce in me, and for my reward you would allow me to make my wine for dessert"
9146,"I cannot close this Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a hopeful glance towards the time when I shall again put forth my two green leaves once a month, and with a faithful remembrance of the genial sun and showers that have fallen on these leaves of David Copperfield, and made me happy"
9147,"and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of our house were—almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes—bolted and locked against it"
9148,"and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and looked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment"
9149,"This was in part confirmed by his aunt, who saw him at half past twelve o’clock, soon after his release, and affirmed that he was then as red as I was"
9150,"The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face, and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn’t peck her in preference to apples"
9151,"There is something of a doleful air about that room to me, for Peggotty has told me—I don’t know when, but apparently ages ago—about my father’s funeral, and the company having their black cloaks put on"
9152,"There is nothing half so green that I know anywhere, as the grass of that churchyard;"
9153,"and I see the red light shining on the sun-dial, and think within myself, ‘Is the sun-dial glad, I wonder, that it can tell the time again?’"
9154,"But I can’t always look at him—I know him without that white thing on, and I am afraid of his wondering why I stare so, and perhaps stopping the service to inquire—and what am I to do?"
9155,Paul’s Cathedral (with a pink dome) painted on the top;
9156,"There was a red velvet footstool in the best parlour, on which my mother had painted a nosegay"
9157,"and there was my mother, looking unusually pretty, I thought, and with her a gentleman with beautiful black hair and whiskers, who had walked home with us from church last Sunday"
9158,"At this minute I see him turn round in the garden, and give us a last look with his ill-omened black eyes, before the door was shut"
9159,"Would you wish me to shave my head and black my face, or disfigure myself with a burn, or a scald, or something of that sort?"
9160,"What else was it possible to infer from what you said, you unkind creature, when you know as well as I do, that on his account only last quarter I wouldn’t buy myself a new parasol, though that old green one is frayed the whole way up, and the fringe is perfectly mangy?"
9161,"Gradually, I became used to seeing the gentleman with the black whiskers"
9162,"Mr. Murdstone and I were soon off, and trotting along on the green turf by the side of the road"
9163,"He had that kind of shallow black eye—I want a better word to express an eye that has no depth in it to be looked into—which, when it is abstracted, seems from some peculiarity of light to be disfigured, for a moment at a time, by a cast"
9164,"A squareness about the lower part of his face, and the dotted indication of the strong black beard he shaved close every day, reminded me of the wax-work that had travelled into our neighbourhood some half-a-year before"
9165,"They left me, during this time, with a very nice man with a very large head of red hair and a very small shiny hat upon it, who had got a cross-barred shirt or waistcoat on, with ‘Skylark’ in capital letters across the chest"
9166,"There was a black barge, or some other kind of superannuated boat, not far off, high and dry on the ground, with an iron funnel sticking out of it for a chimney and smoking very cosily;"
9167,"Abraham in red going to sacrifice Isaac in blue, and Daniel in yellow cast into a den of green lions, were the most prominent of these"
9168,and a nosegay of seaweed in a blue mug on the table
9169,"The walls were whitewashed as white as milk, and the patchwork counterpane made my eyes quite ache with its brightness"
9170,"We were welcomed by a very civil woman in a white apron, whom I had seen curtseying at the door when I was on Ham’s back, about a quarter of a mile off"
9171,"Likewise by a most beautiful little girl (or I thought her so) with a necklace of blue beads on, who wouldn’t let me kiss her when I offered to, but ran away and hid herself"
9172,"Mrs. Peggotty with the white apron, was knitting on the opposite side of the fire"
9173,"‘If I was ever to be a lady, I’d give him a sky-blue coat with diamond buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat, a cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a box of money"
9174,"I am sure my fancy raised up something round that blue-eyed mite of a child, which etherealized, and made a very angel of her"
9175,She took out an old black silk handkerchief and wiped her eyes;
9176,"I very soon started back from there, for the empty dog-kennel was filled up with a great dog—deep mouthed and black-haired like Him—and he was very angry at the sight of me, and sprang out to get at me"
9177,"She brought with her two uncompromising hard black boxes, with her initials on the lids in hard brass nails"
9178,"Having uttered which, with great distinctness, she begged the favour of being shown to her room, which became to me from that time forth a place of awe and dread, wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or known to be left unlocked, and where (for I peeped in once or twice when she was out) numerous little steel fetters and rivets, with which Miss Murdstone embellished herself when she was dressed, generally hung upon the looking-glass in formidable array"
9179,"Again, Miss Murdstone, in a black velvet gown, that looks as if it had been made out of a pall, follows close upon me;"
9180,"To this day, when I look upon the fat black letters in the primer, the puzzling novelty of their shapes, and the easy good-nature of O and Q and S, seem to present themselves again before me as they used to do"
9181,"There, I found my mother, very pale and with red eyes:"
9182,"and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set of castors on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty"
9183,"He was a gaunt, sallow young man, with hollow cheeks, and a chin almost as black as Mr. Murdstone’s;"
9184,"He was dressed in a suit of black clothes which were rather rusty and dry too, and rather short in the sleeves and legs;"
9185,"and he had a white neck-kerchief on, that was not over-clean"
9186,"Accordingly we looked in at a baker’s window, and after I had made a series of proposals to buy everything that was bilious in the shop, and he had rejected them one by one, we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread, which cost me threepence"
9187,"The Master at Salem House lifted the latch of one of a number of little black doors that were all alike, and had each a little diamond-paned window on one side, and another little diamond—paned window above;"
9188,"I sat down to my brown loaf, my egg, and my rasher of bacon, with a basin of milk besides, and made a most delicious meal"
9189,"but I was so dead sleepy, that when we stopped on the road to take up somebody else, they put me inside where there were no passengers, and where I slept profoundly, until I found the coach going at a footpace up a steep hill among green leaves"
9190,"Two miserable little white mice, left behind by their owner, are running up and down in a fusty castle made of pasteboard and wire, looking in all the corners with their red eyes for anything to eat"
9191,"How vividly I call to mind the damp about the house, the green cracked flagstones in the court, an old leaky water-butt, and the discoloured trunks of some of the grim trees, which seemed to have dripped more in the rain than other trees, and to have blown less in the sun!"
9192,"Then, we had more tasks until tea, which Mr. Mell drank out of a blue teacup, and I out of a tin pot"
9193,"the moonlight falling a little way into the room, through the window, painting a pale window on the floor, and the greater part of us in shadow, except when Steerforth dipped a match into a phosphorus-box, when he wanted to look for anything on the board, and shed a blue glare over us that was gone directly!"
9194,"and that he needn’t be so ‘bounceable’—somebody else said ‘bumptious’—about it, because his own red hair was very plainly to be seen behind"
9195,"Mr. Creakle cuts a joke before he beats him, and we laugh at it,—miserable little dogs, we laugh, with our visages as white as ashes, and our hearts sinking into our boots"
9196,"when sleep overpowers me for a minute, he still looms through my slumber, ruling those ciphering-books, until he softly comes behind me and wakes me to plainer perception of him, with a red ridge across my back"
9197,"When Steerforth, in white trousers, carried her parasol for her, I felt proud to know him;"
9198,"Sometimes, to make it a more sovereign specific, he was so kind as to squeeze orange juice into it, or to stir it up with ginger, or dissolve a peppermint drop in it;"
9199,‘Why it’s as black as jet!
9200,"and after being drugged with black draughts and blue pills, to an extent which Demple (whose father was a doctor) said was enough to undermine a horse’s constitution, received a caning and six chapters of Greek Testament for refusing to confess"
9201,"I had my own old plate, with a brown view of a man-of-war in full sail upon it, which Peggotty had hoarded somewhere all the time I had been away, and would not have had broken, she said, for a hundred pounds"
9202,"Her own was as red as ever I saw it, or any other face, I think;"
9203,and her hand was so thin and white that it seemed to me to be almost transparent
9204,"When it was asleep again, I crept close to my mother’s side according to my old custom, broken now a long time, and sat with my arms embracing her waist, and my little red cheek on her shoulder, and once more felt her beautiful hair drooping over me—like an angel’s wing as I used to think, I recollect—and was very happy indeed"
9205,"While I sat thus, looking at the fire, and seeing pictures in the red-hot coals, I almost believed that I had never been away;"
9206,I could not restrain my eye from resting for an instant on a red spot upon it;
9207,"but it was not so red as I turned, when I met that sinister expression in his face"
9208,"I stood upon a chair when I was left alone, and looked into the glass to see how red my eyes were, and how sorrowful my face"
9209,"and instead of him a fat, short-winded, merry-looking, little old man in black, with rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees of his breeches, black stockings, and a broad-brimmed hat, came puffing up to the coach window, and said:"
9210,"We went into a little back-parlour behind the shop, where we found three young women at work on a quantity of black materials, which were heaped upon the table, and little bits and cuttings of which were littered all over the floor"
9211,"There was a good fire in the room, and a breathless smell of warm black crape—I did not know what the smell was then, but I know now"
9212,"‘I have been acquainted with you,’ said Mr. Omer, after watching me for some minutes, during which I had not made much impression on the breakfast, for the black things destroyed my appetite, ‘I have been acquainted with you a long time, my young friend"
9213,"and then she put her thimble and scissors in her pocket, and stuck a needle threaded with black thread neatly in the bosom of her gown, and put on her outer clothing smartly, at a little glass behind the door, in which I saw the reflection of her pleased face"
9214,"I remember it as a kind of half chaise-cart, half pianoforte-van, painted of a sombre colour, and drawn by a black horse with a long tail"
9215,"I only recollect that underneath some white covering on the bed, with a beautiful cleanliness and freshness all around it, there seemed to me to lie embodied the solemn stillness that was in the house;"
9216,"The very air of the best parlour, when I went in at the door, the bright condition of the fire, the shining of the wine in the decanters, the patterns of the glasses and plates, the faint sweet smell of cake, the odour of Miss Murdstone’s dress, and our black clothes"
9217,"Nor could I help thinking this a prudent course, since she looked at me out of the pickle-jar, with as great an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its contents"
9218,"All within was the same, down to the seaweed in the blue mug in my bedroom"
9219,"But when she drew nearer, and I saw her blue eyes looking bluer, and her dimpled face looking brighter, and her whole self prettier and gayer, a curious feeling came over me that made me pretend not to know her, and pass by as if I were looking at something a long way off"
9220,"I was running on, very fast indeed, when my eyes rested on little Em’ly’s face, which was bent forward over the table, listening with the deepest attention, her breath held, her blue eyes sparkling like jewels, and the colour mantling in her cheeks"
9221,"but Mr. Barkis bloomed in a new blue coat, of which the tailor had given him such good measure, that the cuffs would have rendered gloves unnecessary in the coldest weather, while the collar was so high that it pushed his hair up on end on the top of his head"
9222,"Behold me, on the morrow, in a much-worn little white hat, with a black crape round it for my mother, a black jacket, and a pair of hard, stiff corduroy trousers—which Miss Murdstone considered the best armour for the legs in that fight with the world which was now to come off"
9223,"He informed me that his father was a bargeman, and walked, in a black velvet head-dress, in the Lord Mayor’s Show"
9224,"I went in, and found there a stoutish, middle-aged person, in a brown surtout and black tights and shoes, with no more hair upon his head (which was a large one, and very shining) than there is upon an egg, and with a very extensive face, which he turned full upon me"
9225,stencilled all over with an ornament which my young imagination represented as a blue muffin;
9226,"When I dined regularly and handsomely, I had a saveloy and a penny loaf, or a fourpenny plate of red beef from a cook’s shop;"
9227,"’ A certain man named Gregory, who was foreman of the packers, and another named Tipp, who was the carman, and wore a red jacket, used to address me sometimes as ‘David’:"
9228,"It made me very miserable to hear it, and I looked at Mrs. Micawber’s red eyes with the utmost sympathy"
9229,"More than once, when I went there early, I had audience of him in a turn-up bedstead, with a cut in his forehead or a black eye, bearing witness to his excesses over-night (I am afraid he was quarrelsome in his drink), and he, with a shaking hand, endeavouring to find the needful shillings in one or other of the pockets of his clothes, which lay upon the floor, while his wife, with a baby in her arms and her shoes down at heel, never left off rating him"
9230,"The Captain himself was in the last extremity of shabbiness, with large whiskers, and an old, old brown great-coat with no other coat below it"
9231,"As I drew nearer to them, trying to propitiate the tinker by my looks, I observed that the woman had a black eye"
9232,"and left me standing at the garden-gate, looking disconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window, where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the middle, a large round green screen or fan fastened on to the windowsill, a small table, and a great chair, suggested to me that my aunt might be at that moment seated in awful state"
9233,"From head to foot I was powdered almost as white with chalk and dust, as if I had come out of a lime-kiln"
9234,"and then, sitting herself down behind the green fan or screen I have already mentioned, so that I could not see her face, ejaculated at intervals, ‘Mercy on us!’ letting those exclamations off like minute guns"
9235,"He was dressed like any other ordinary gentleman, in a loose grey morning coat and waistcoat, and white trousers;"
9236,"and I saw the old-fashioned furniture brightly rubbed and polished, my aunt’s inviolable chair and table by the round green fan in the bow-window, the drugget-covered carpet, the cat, the kettle-holder, the two canaries, the old china, the punchbowl full of dried rose-leaves, the tall press guarding all sorts of bottles and pots, and, wonderfully out of keeping with the rest, my dusty self upon the sofa, taking note of everything"
9237,"Upon which, Janet came running up the stairs as if the house were in flames, darted out on a little piece of green in front, and warned off two saddle-donkeys, lady-ridden, that had presumed to set hoof upon it;"
9238,"but certainly there was nothing else, when I awoke, to lead me to believe that they had been uttered by my aunt, who sat in the bow-window gazing at the sea from behind the green fan, which was mounted on a kind of swivel, and turned any way"
9239,"I remember how the solemn feeling with which at length I turned my eyes away, yielded to the sensation of gratitude and rest which the sight of the white-curtained bed—and how much more the lying softly down upon it, nestling in the snow-white sheets!—inspired"
9240,"When all these tasks were performed to her satisfaction, she took off the gloves and apron, folded them up, put them in the particular corner of the press from which they had been taken, brought out her work-box to her own table in the open window, and sat down, with the green fan between her and the light, to work"
9241,"He had stood by the door, all this while, observant of her with a smile upon his face, though his black eyebrows were heavily contracted"
9242,"‘Let me see you ride a donkey over my green again, and as sure as you have a head upon your shoulders, I’ll knock your bonnet off, and tread upon it!’"
9243,"I used to fancy, as I sat by him of an evening, on a green slope, and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet air, that it lifted his mind out of its confusion, and bore it (such was my boyish thought) into the skies"
9244,the two stone steps descending to the door were as white as if they had been covered with fair linen;
9245,"It was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window, though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people"
9246,"It belonged to a red-haired person—a youth of fifteen, as I take it now, but looking much older—whose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble;"
9247,"who had hardly any eyebrows, and no eyelashes, and eyes of a red-brown, so unsheltered and unshaded, that I remember wondering how he went to sleep"
9248,"dressed in decent black, with a white wisp of a neckcloth;"
9249,"one of a gentleman with grey hair (though not by any means an old man) and black eyebrows, who was looking over some papers tied together with red tape;"
9250,"’ His hair was quite white now, though his eyebrows were still black"
9251,"He was very cleanly dressed, in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, and nankeen trousers;"
9252,"but looking that way more attentively, it made me uncomfortable to observe that, every now and then, his sleepless eyes would come below the writing, like two red suns, and stealthily stare at me for I dare say a whole minute at a time, during which his pen went, or pretended to go, as cleverly as ever"
9253,"and whenever I looked towards those two red suns, I was sure to find them, either just rising or just setting"
9254,"It was a prettily furnished room, with a piano and some lively furniture in red and green, and some flowers"
9255,"and almost as stiff and heavy as the great stone urns that flanked them, and were set up, on the top of the red-brick wall, at regular distances all round the court, like sublimated skittles, for Time to play at"
9256,his long black gaiters unbuttoned;
9257,"He looked like a young clergyman, in his white cravat, but he was very affable and good-humoured;"
9258,"We had scarcely done so, when Uriah Heep put in his red head and his lank hand at the door, and said:"
9259,he made such an appearance all the while of keeping his red eyes dutifully on his master
9260,"and dreaming, among other things, that he had launched Mr. Peggotty’s house on a piratical expedition, with a black flag at the masthead, bearing the inscription ‘Tidd’s Practice’, under which diabolical ensign he was carrying me and little Em’ly to the Spanish Main, to be drowned"
9261,"The clear red and white of her complexion was not so blooming and flower-like as usual, I thought, when she turned round;"
9262,"so they brought her in, looking very white and weak, I thought, and sat her on a sofa"
9263,"The eyes were wide open, and her brown hair fell in two rich clusters on her shoulders, and on her white dress, disordered by the want of the lost ribbon"
9264,"How many winter days have I seen him, standing blue-nosed, in the snow and east wind, looking at the boys going down the long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture!"
9265,there was Uriah’s blue bag lying down and vomiting papers;
9266,"and replied, with my hat in my hand, and a very red face, I have no doubt, that I was a pupil at Doctor Strong’s"
9267,"The earthy smell, the sunless air, the sensation of the world being shut out, the resounding of the organ through the black and white arched galleries and aisles, are wings that take me back, and hold me hovering above those days, in a half-sleeping and half-waking dream"
9268,"He is a broad-faced, bull-necked, young butcher, with rough red cheeks, an ill-conditioned mind, and an injurious tongue"
9269,"It is a summer evening, down in a green hollow, at the corner of a wall"
9270,"For three or four days I remain at home, a very ill-looking subject, with a green shade over my eyes;"
9271,"She is a tall, dark, black-eyed, fine figure of a woman"
9272,"She is dressed in blue, with blue flowers in her hair—forget-me-nots—as if SHE had any need to wear forget-me-nots"
9273,"I only know that I swim about in space, with a blue angel, in a state of blissful delirium, until I find myself alone with her in a little room, resting on a sofa"
9274,"I go home in a state of unspeakable bliss, and waltz in imagination, all night long, with my arm round the blue waist of my dear divinity"
9275,"It’s not fair to abuse my confidence,’ I answered, reddening at the recollection of my blue enslaver"
9276,"The gentleman spoken of was a gentleman with a very unpromising squint, and a prominent chin, who had a tall white hat on with a narrow flat brim, and whose close-fitting drab trousers seemed to button all the way up outside his legs from his boots to his hips"
9277,"It was not in the coffee-room that I found Steerforth expecting me, but in a snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, where the fire burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table covered with a clean cloth;"
9278,"She had black hair and eager black eyes, and was thin, and had a scar upon her lip"
9279,"He coughed to that extent, and his breath eluded all his attempts to recover it with that obstinacy, that I fully expected to see his head go down behind the counter, and his little black breeches, with the rusty little bunches of ribbons at the knees, come quivering up in a last ineffectual struggle"
9280,"I saw her, a most beautiful little creature, with the cloudless blue eyes, that had looked into my childish heart, turned laughingly upon another child of Minnie’s who was playing near her;"
9281,"and as they all stood crowded round the door to light us as far as they could upon our road, I saw the sweet blue eyes of little Em’ly peeping after us, from behind Ham, and heard her soft voice calling to us to be careful how we went"
9282,"‘But you are spoiling them for me,’ said I, as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood, striking out of it a train of red-hot sparks that went careering up the little chimney, and roaring out into the air"
9283,"‘That is a black shadow to be following the girl,’ said Steerforth, standing still;"
9284,"Red by nature, black by art"
9285,"To see Miss Mowcher standing over him, looking at his rich profusion of brown hair through a large round magnifying glass, which she took out of her pocket, was a most amazing spectacle"
9286,"One of these, a little dry man, sitting by himself, who wore a stiff brown wig that looked as if it were made of gingerbread, rose to receive my aunt, and show us into Mr. Spenlow’s room"
9287,"and the green baize on the top of the writing-table had lost all its colour, and was as withered and pale as an old pauper"
9288,"I was casting my eyes with increasing complacency over these and many similar objects, when hasty footsteps were heard in the room outside, and Mr. Spenlow, in a black gown trimmed with white fur, came hurrying in, taking off his hat as he came"
9289,"He was a little light-haired gentleman, with undeniable boots, and the stiffest of white cravats and shirt-collars"
9290,"and there, on the two sides of a raised platform of the horse-shoe form, sitting on easy old-fashioned dining-room chairs, were sundry gentlemen in red gowns and grey wigs, whom I found to be the Doctors aforesaid"
9291,"In the space within the horse-shoe, lower than these, that is to say, on about the level of the floor, were sundry other gentlemen, of Mr. Spenlow’s rank, and dressed like him in black gowns with white fur upon them, sitting at a long green table"
9292,"I found Mr. Waterbrook to be a middle-aged gentleman, with a short throat, and a good deal of shirt-collar, who only wanted a black nose to be the portrait of a pug-dog"
9293,"and when I had paid my homage to Mrs. Waterbrook, presented me, with much ceremony, to a very awful lady in a black velvet dress, and a great black velvet hat, whom I remember as looking like a near relation of Hamlet’s—say his aunt"
9294,he in the glare of a red velvet lady;
9295,"As he sat on my sofa, with his long knees drawn up under his coffee-cup, his hat and gloves upon the ground close to him, his spoon going softly round and round, his shadowless red eyes, which looked as if they had scorched their lashes off, turned towards me without looking at me, the disagreeable dints I have formerly described in his nostrils coming and going with his breath, and a snaky undulation pervading his frame from his chin to his boots, I decided in my own mind that I disliked him intensely"
9296,"I recollect well how indignantly my heart beat, as I saw his crafty face, with the appropriately red light of the fire upon it, preparing for something else"
9297,"I believe I had a delirious idea of seizing the red-hot poker out of the fire, and running him through with it"
9298,"but the image of Agnes, outraged by so much as a thought of this red-headed animal’s, remained in my mind when I looked at him, sitting all awry as if his mean soul griped his body, and made me giddy"
9299,"I thought, between sleeping and waking, that it was still red hot, and I had snatched it out of the fire, and run him through the body"
9300,"He described it as an apartment of the most sumptuous nature, and said that he had drunk brown East India sherry there, of a quality so precious as to make a man wink"
9301,"We turned into a room near at hand (I think it was the identical breakfast-room, made memorable by the brown East Indian sherry), and I heard a voice say, ‘Mr. Copperfield, my daughter Dora, and my daughter Dora’s confidential friend!’ It was, no doubt, Mr. Spenlow’s voice, but I didn’t know it, and I didn’t care whose it was"
9302,"As to the straw hat and blue ribbons which was on the top of the curls, if I could only have hung it up in my room in Buckingham Street, what a priceless possession it would have been!"
9303,"and then I see a straw hat and blue ribbons, and a quantity of curls, and a little black dog being held up, in two slender arms, against a bank of blossoms and bright leaves"
9304,"The refuse was not wholly vegetable either, for I myself saw a shoe, a doubled-up saucepan, a black bonnet, and an umbrella, in various stages of decomposition, as I was looking out for the number I wanted"
9305,In a corner of the room was something neatly covered up with a large white cloth
9306,"Traddles rose from his chair, and, with a triumphant smile, put his hand upon the white cloth I had observed"
9307,"a little more slatternly than she used to be, or so she seemed now, to my unaccustomed eyes, but still with some preparation of herself for company, and with a pair of brown gloves on"
9308,"The leg of mutton came up very red within, and very pale without:"
9309,"Mrs. Micawber put on her brown gloves, and assumed a genteel languor"
9310,"‘My love, be silent,’ said Mrs. Micawber, laying her brown glove on his hand"
9311,"I was agreeably surprised to find that Littimer was not there, and that we were attended by a modest little parlour-maid, with blue ribbons in her cap, whose eye it was much more pleasant, and much less disconcerting, to catch by accident, than the eye of that respectable man"
9312,"So surely as I looked towards her, did I see that eager visage, with its gaunt black eyes and searching brow, intent on mine;"
9313,"” For—don’t you see,’ said Mr. Omer, touching me with his pipe, ‘it ain’t likely that a man so short of breath as myself, and a grandfather too, would go and strain points with a little bit of a blue-eyed blossom, like her?’"
9314,"I mean I was not dressed up in a black coat and a streamer, to frighten the birds;"
9315,"You were hot and cold, and red and white, all at once when I spoke to you of her"
9316,"Its leaves and shoots were green then, and the day being sunny, a pair of glass doors leading to the garden were thrown open"
9317,"It was a warm, dusty evening, just the time when, in the great main thoroughfare out of which that by-way turned, there was a temporary lull in the eternal tread of feet upon the pavement, and a strong red sunshine"
9318,"when I DID find the house, and DID dismount at the garden-gate, and drag those stony-hearted boots across the lawn to Dora sitting on a garden-seat under a lilac tree, what a spectacle she was, upon that beautiful morning, among the butterflies, in a white chip bonnet and a dress of celestial blue!"
9319,"It was a green spot, on a hill, carpeted with soft turf"
9320,"But all of my own sex—especially one impostor, three or four years my elder, with a red whisker, on which he established an amount of presumption not to be endured—were my mortal foes"
9321,The young creature in pink had a mother in green;
9322,"When I measured Dora’s finger for a ring that was to be made of Forget-me-nots, and when the jeweller, to whom I took the measure, found me out, and laughed over his order-book, and charged me anything he liked for the pretty little toy, with its blue stones—so associated in my remembrance with Dora’s hand, that yesterday, when I saw such another, by chance, on the finger of my own daughter, there was a momentary stirring in my heart, like pain!"
9323,"‘Fancy, aunt!’ I exclaimed, as red as I could be"
9324,"and that he had a dingy little black-hole of his own upstairs, where no business was ever done, and where there was a yellow old cartridge-paper pad upon his desk, unsoiled by ink, and reported to be twenty years of age"
9325,"and even the round green fan, which my aunt had brought away with her, screwed on to the window-sill"
9326,"In acknowledgement of this question, addressed to him with extraordinary curtness, Mr. Heep, uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried, replied that he was pretty well, he thanked my aunt, and hoped she was the same"
9327,"The red fox made him say all this, I knew, to exhibit him to me in the light he had indicated on the night when he poisoned my rest"
9328,"An old red-brick mansion, used as a school, was in its place;"
9329,"There was a softened shade upon her face, thrown from some green leaves overhanging the open window of the low room;"
9330,"Her only association with the word was a yellow face and a nightcap, or a pair of crutches, or a wooden leg, or a dog with a decanter-stand in his mouth, or something of that kind;"
9331,"But going on, too, working pretty hard, and busily keeping red-hot all the irons I now had in the fire, I would sit sometimes of a night, opposite my aunt, thinking how I had frightened Dora that time, and how I could best make my way with a guitar-case through the forest of difficulty, until I used to fancy that my head was turning quite grey"
9332,"But, as to reading them after I had got them, I might as well have copied the Chinese inscriptions of an immense collection of tea-chests, or the golden characters on all the great red and green bottles in the chemists’ shops!"
9333,"‘If I am not mistaken,’ said Mr. Spenlow, as Miss Murdstone brought a parcel of letters out of her reticule, tied round with the dearest bit of blue ribbon, ‘those are also from your pen, Mr. Copperfield?’"
9334,"Man appears in kitchen, with blue bag, “for lady’s boots left out to heel”"
9335,"and the Commons was even scandalized by our principal inveigler (who had formerly been in the wine trade, and afterwards in the sworn brokery line) walking about for some days with a black eye"
9336,"Any one of these scouts used to think nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black out of a vehicle, killing any proctor whom she inquired for, representing his employer as the lawful successor and representative of that proctor, and bearing the old lady off (sometimes greatly affected) to his employer’s office"
9337,"The last time I was in the Commons, a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway, and whispering the word ‘Marriage-licence’ in my ear, was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me into a proctor’s"
9338,"Traddles said ‘Exactly so,’ and became pretty red in the face"
9339,"How beautiful she was in her black frock, and how she sobbed and cried at first, and wouldn’t come out from behind the door!"
9340,"He gave me a sidelong glance out of his sinister red eyes, and laughed"
9341,"His eyes looked green now, as they watched mine with a rascally cunning"
9342,"‘Now, I’m not a-going to let myself be run down, Copperfield,’ he continued, raising that part of his countenance, where his red eyebrows would have been if he had had any, with malignant triumph, ‘and I shall do what I can to put a stop to this friendship"
9343,"long enough for me to see the white marks of my fingers die out of the deep red of his cheek, and leave it a deeper red"
9344,"At all events his face was tied up in a black silk handkerchief, which, with his hat perched on the top of it, was far from improving his appearance"
9345,"skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and foot with red tape"
9346,"Miss Lavinia, self-charged with the superintendence of my darling’s wardrobe, is constantly cutting out brown-paper cuirasses, and differing in opinion from a highly respectable young man, with a long bundle, and a yard measure under his arm"
9347,"with the flowers on the carpets looking as if freshly gathered, and the green leaves on the paper as if they had just come out;"
9348,"with the spotless muslin curtains, and the blushing rose-coloured furniture, and Dora’s garden hat with the blue ribbon—do I remember, now, how I loved her in such another hat when I first knew her!—already hanging on its little peg;"
9349,"She is dressed in lavender-coloured silk, and has a white bonnet on, and is amazing"
9350,"Her hands were clasped upon my shoulder, and her chin rested on them, and her blue eyes looked quietly into mine"
9351,"She answered without moving, otherwise than as the arm I twined about her may have brought her blue eyes nearer to me:"
9352,"But generally, when I raised my head, I saw her blue eyes looking at me with the quiet attention of which I have already spoken"
9353,"She had her arms around the Doctor’s neck, and he leant his head down over her, mingling his grey hair with her dark brown tresses"
9354,"I fell into a brown study as I walked on, and a voice at my side made me start"
9355,"I was not long in recollecting Mrs. Steerforth’s little parlour-maid, who had formerly worn blue ribbons in her cap"
9356,"I mean this low girl whom he picked out of the tide-mud,’ with her black eyes full upon me, and her passionate finger up, ‘may be alive,—for I believe some common things are hard to die"
9357,That there blue water as she used to speak on
9358,"Slimy gaps and causeways, winding among old wooden piles, with a sickly substance clinging to the latter, like green hair, and the rags of last year’s handbills offering rewards for drowned men fluttering above high-water mark, led down through the ooze and slush to the ebb-tide"
9359,"My aunt retired behind the round green fan of former days, which was screwed on the back of a chair, and occasionally wiped her eyes, for about a quarter of an hour"
9360,"Though he studiously concealed his hand, this morning before breakfast, in writing the direction-card which he attached to the little brown valise of happier days, the eagle-glance of matrimonial anxiety detected, d, o, n, distinctly traced"
9361,"He had relinquished his legal suit of black for the purposes of this excursion, and wore the old surtout and tights, but not quite with the old air"
9362,"I fancy his figure before me now, standing near her sofa, with his rough cap in his hand, and the blue eyes of my child-wife raised, with a timid wonder, to his face"
9363,"There was a little green perspective of trellis-work and ivy at the side of our cottage, through which I could see, from the garden where I was walking, into the road before the house"
9364,"I saw the flashing black eyes, and the passion-wasted figure;"
9365,"and I saw the scar, with its white track cutting through her lips, quivering and throbbing as she spoke"
9366,"and so quiet, that there warn’t a sound but the rippling of that blue sea without a tide, upon the shore"
9367,"She come, white and hurried, upon Em’ly in her sleep"
9368,"and brought her safe out, in the dead of the night, from that black pit of ruin!"
9369,I thought of the blue-eyed child who had enchanted me
9370,"‘You are not busy, Mr. Heep?’ said Traddles, whose eye the cunning red eye accidentally caught, as it at once scrutinized and evaded us"
9371,"Uriah, more blue than white at these words, made a dart at the letter, as if to tear it in pieces"
9372,"What a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to be—and in all life, within doors and without—when I sit in the quiet, shaded, orderly room, with the blue eyes of my child-wife turned towards me, and her little fingers twining round my hand!"
9373,"When poor Mrs. Micawber saw me come in, in my black clothes, she was sensibly affected"
9374,"When some white-headed billows thundered on, and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the land, every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of its wrath, rushing to be gathered to the composition of another monster"
9375,"but could see nothing, except the reflection in the window-panes of the faint candle I had left burning, and of my own haggard face looking in at me from the black void"
9376,"He had a singular red cap on,—not like a sailor’s cap, but of a finer colour;"
9377,"‘It’s false,’ she cried, tearing her black hair;"
9378,"and when he and the Micawbers cordially shook hands as comrades, and his brown face brightened with a smile, I felt that he would make his way, establish a good name, and be beloved, go where he would"
9379,"and elsewhere by the yellow daylight straying down a windsail or a hatchway—were crowded groups of people, making new friendships, taking leave of one another, talking, laughing, crying, eating and drinking;"
9380,"She lay between us, and the red light;"
9381,"This waiter, who was middle-aged and spare, looked for help to a waiter of more authority—a stout, potential old man, with a double chin, in black breeches and stockings, who came out of a place like a churchwarden’s pew, at the end of the coffee-room, where he kept company with a cash-box, a Directory, a Law-list, and other books and papers"
9382,"and at the comfortable green curtains, with their pure brass rods, snugly enclosing the boxes;"
9383,How brown you are!
9384,"and of the tea and toast, and children’s songs, in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment, red-tape, dusty wafers, ink-jars, brief and draft paper, law reports, writs, declarations, and bills of costs;"
9385,"‘You anticipate, sir,’ said Mr. Chillip, his eyelids getting quite red with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging"
9386,"‘You will find her father a white-haired old man,’ said my aunt, ‘though a better man in all other respects—a reclaimed man"
9387,"‘My part in them,’ said Mr. Wickfield, shaking his white head, ‘has much matter for regret—for deep regret, and deep contrition, Trotwood, you well know"
9388,"and I show Sophy which of the diamond-eyed serpents, coiled up on white satin rising grounds, I would give her if I could afford it;"
9389,"and as no house in England but this must hold you, tell me where to send for your luggage (is the old black bag among it, that went so far, I wonder!), and then, over a glass of Yarmouth grog, we will have the tidings of ten years!’"
9390,"soft, sorrowful, blue eyes;"
9391,"The cheeks and arms of Peggotty, so hard and red in my childish days, when I wondered why the birds didn’t peck her in preference to apples, are shrivelled now;"
9392,"and near her stands a sharp, dark, withered woman, with a white scar on her lip"
9393,"Indeed it is Julia Mills, peevish and fine, with a black man to carry cards and letters to her on a golden salver, and a copper-coloured woman in linen, with a bright handkerchief round her head, to serve her Tiffin in her dressing-room"
9394,"eternally quarrels with the old Scotch Croesus, who is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide"
9395,"For, though Julia has a stately house, and mighty company, and sumptuous dinners every day, I see no green growth near her;"
9396,It sparkled in the sunlight like white fire
9397,"He was at a loss to divine what they meant, until he discovered that at the bottom of each chart there was a picture of a globe, with a tiny red arrow pointing to a section of it"
9398,"Beside him was a young child, enclosed in a red circle that set him off from the old man"
9399,Then he forgot his hatred of the black-browed one in contemplation of other things
9400,His little red-rimmed eyes were alight with anticipation
9401,Rog's face was black with fury
9402,a red circle from which a small sector had been removed
9403,"On a low couch under the glass bell lay an old man clad in flowing, white garments"
9404,Two red wires led from the machinery to a board on which were a number of dials and things that Rog scarcely gave a second glance
9405,"His eyes fastened on a shining red circle of metal, exactly the same as the symbol on the door"
9406,Now he went to it and lifted the heavy little bit of red stuff
9407,"Were his eyes deceiving him, or had the placid white face become flushed?"
9408,"His sloping shoulders bulged massively under a mat of black hair, and his short body was tight with muscles drawn hard by hatred"
9409,"Already black clouds gather, but you let old men and women, as well as the younger ones, find food to keep the fat on your bones during the long winter"
9410,"He saw Lo watching him wide-eyed and white of face, and realized Luk-no was grinning at his predicament"
9411,"Did you think to get close enough to kill it with that?"" His close-set, red-rimmed eyes blazed"
9412,"His wide mouth was distorted, baring ugly black snags of teeth as he advanced"
9413,"Suddenly, as he backed to the very edge of the crowd, he saw a shadow rise swiftly over his head, in the black images cast on the ground"
9414,With a scream of pain the black-browed one went down
9415,it makes you headstrong against objections and red rags;
9416,"Whoever, in intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy, gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;"
9417,"What they would fain attain with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow happiness of the herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines are called ""Equality of Rights"" and ""Sympathy with All Sufferers""—and suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be DONE AWAY WITH"
9418,"So cold, so icy, that one burns one's finger at the touch of him! Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!—And for that very reason many think him red-hot"
9419,"the portion of independence and green meadow without which there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration (which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability), the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and again to be overcome"
9420,"As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley colours:"
9421,"and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music, which does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music does, at the sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of sky—a super-European music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown sunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey"
9422,also one's black spectacles:
9423,"Alas, only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments!"
9424,"There opposite, upon the green enamel, Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits, Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted"
9425,"""Master, who are those People, whom the black air so castigates?"" ""The first of those, of whom intelligence Thou fain wouldst have,"" then said he unto me, ""The empress was of many languages"
9426,"""O living creature gracious and benignant, Who visiting goest through the purple air Us, who have stained the world incarnadine, If were the King of the Universe our friend, We would pray unto him to give thee peace, Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse"
9427,"A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx, This tristful brooklet, when it has descended Down to the foot of the malign gray shores"
9428,"He stopped attentive, like a man who listens, Because the eye could not conduct him far Through the black air, and through the heavy fog"
9429,"Because mine eye had altogether drawn me Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit, Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen The three infernal Furies stained with blood, Who had the limbs of women and their mien, And with the greenest hydras were begirt;"
9430,"But tell me, those within the fat lagoon, Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat, And who encounter with such bitter tongues, Wherefore are they inside of the red city Not punished, if God has them in his wrath, And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?"" And unto me he said:"
9431,That forehead there which has the hair so black Is Azzolin;
9432,""" As out of a green brand, that is on fire At one of the ends, and from the other drips And hisses with the wind that is escaping;"
9433,"Behind them was the forest full of black She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain"
9434,"""but the boiling of the red Water might well solve one of them thou makest"
9435,"And, ""If the misery of this soft place Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,"" Began one, ""and our aspect black and blistered, Let the renown of us thy mind incline To tell us who thou art, who thus securely Thy living feet dost move along through Hell"
9436,"And as I gazing round me come among them, Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw That had the face and posture of a lion"
9437,"Proceeding then the current of my sight, Another of them saw I, red as blood, Display a goose more white than butter is"
9438,""" Such as he is who has so near the ague Of quartan that his nails are blue already, And trembles all, but looking at the shade;"
9439,"That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly, Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs The Carrarese who houses underneath, Among the marbles white a cavern had For his abode;"
9440,"And I beheld behind us a black devil, Running along upon the crag, approach"

9579,"Of the two others, who head downward are, The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;"
9580,"If we had lived opposite to the post-office, the lending library, or even the hotel, we should have enjoyed a livelier outlook, but “Mound & Son—Funeral Establishment—Coffins, Hearses, and every Requisite,” to quote from the inscription over the door, in rigid white characters on a mourning ground, afforded but a gloomy and dispiriting prospect"
9581,"It was too dark to descry more than the outline of an ornamental sign, on which was depicted an elegant open glass vehicle, drawn by four prancing black horses, with nodding plumes and streaming tails—triumphant-looking steeds, who seemed to say, “Man treats most of us barbarously all our lives, then kills us, and makes money of our very skin and bones;"
9582,"The interior of our sitting-room corresponded with its dreary view—a lodging-house apartment pur et simple, with narrow windows, hideous wall-paper, the inevitable round table, cheap chiffonier, and bulgy green rep sofa, to complete the picture"
9583,"The fire was low, and unquestionably in a bad temper, emitting every now and then slow and sullen puffs of yellow smoke"
9584,"There was only a difference of twelve years between us, and Emma, as my stepmother wished me to call her, was a pretty little Irishwoman, with black hair, dark blue eyes (wonderful eyes and lashes), and a radiant smile"
9585,"Generally, she was to be seen on what is called “the top of the wave,” though, occasionally, there came a terrible reaction, and she sank, overwhelmed, into the black abysmal depths which are the birthright of those who are endowed with a nervous, highly strung, mercurial temperament"
9586,"I was fitted out by “Ninette,” her own milliner, in a black crépon and silk, and a large French picture-hat, with black ostrich feathers—expense absolutely no object"
9587,"I met our landlady on the stairs, looking excessively fierce and red in the face, and I subsequently discovered Emma encompassed with letters, bills, and books, and dissolved in floods of tears"
9588,"Beguiled by an amusing magazine, and a box of Fuller’s sweets—poor remnants of her little luxuries—she soon forgot all her sorrows, and to have seen her reclining there, looking so pretty in her cool black tea-gown, and dainty little beaded shoes, no one would have believed she had a care in the world"
9589,"Emma liked to sit there the whole afternoon, returning home by what we called “our own green carriage” in time for our frugal tea"
9590,"Nevertheless, I was endowed with a white chiffon parasol, an opera cloak, three pairs of scarlet silk stockings, an exquisite silk and lace petticoat—I who so sadly wanted everyday gloves and boots"
9591,"He was a good-looking young man, with a somewhat thin, aristocratic face, brown hair, brown eyes, and a light, reddish-brown mustache"
9592,"I had never met this man till half an hour ago, and here was this ultra-smart young woman in a French bonnet standing over me, her pale blue eyes distinctly telling me that I was a designing adventuress"
9593,"A dainty luncheon had been provided, which we discussed under cool green branches, up a deliciously sequestered backwater;"
9594,"but for a smart luncheon at a smart club, for an exclusive gathering at a private view, where possibly all the gowns would be carefully noted down and described in the papers, our now rusty black dresses would be, oh, so sadly out of place!"
9595,"It was only when we got among the present season’s new dresses, and stood side by side with the latest and most costly fashions, that our poor black feathers looked a little battered and draggled!"
9596,"She was dressed in a large white hat, and filmy summer gown, this warm July day, and was sauntering around, attended by a military man, occasionally scanning people or pictures, with a long-handled eye-glass"
9597,She wore a handsome black satin and lace tea-gown (a remnant of better days);
9598,"I have a lovely white satin that I only wore once, and that will alter quite easily for you!”"
9599,") The Misses Benny, extremely exclusive spinsters from the Dovecote, appeared bearing their mama’s card and excuses—prim, long-nosed women, wearing severe tailor-made dresses, prim felt hats with one wing, and attired alike even to their gold bangles and brown kid gloves"
9600,"The departing Bennys met in the narrow doorway Lady Bloss and Miss Bloss, the former a commanding matron in black velvet, with a miniature catafalque upon her stately head—aquiline, portly, immensely condescending, with a very large person and a small squeaky voice"
9601,"We were shown “The Abbey,” as people called it—a low-lying, venerable, gray structure, with fine old trees and wonderful cloisters"
9602,"She had a smooth and beautiful complexion, brown hair worn over a cushion, a pair of bright eyes, an animated expression, and a pointed chin"
9603,"We had been stitching all the morning at the dress in which I was to make my début at the Abbey—a rich white satin, long and plain, which Emma had worn but once, and that fitted me with surprisingly little alteration, beyond lengthening the skirt"
9604,"a long plain white satin gown, a lace fichu knotted in front, and a little gold necklet and locket which had once belonged to my own mother"
9605,"We drove under a portico, stepped out on red cloth, were ushered up by powdered footmen, and passed on to the ladies’ room, where three or four smart maids were ready to relieve us of our wraps"
9606,"The sisters Benny were dressed alike in prim black evening dresses, with stiff little bouquets pinned in on the left side—just over the region of the heart"
9607,"At the head of the stairs we were received by Mrs. Cholmondeley, all smiles, diamonds, and blue crêpe"
9608,"I looked up suddenly, and caught his rather small, keen blue eyes fixed on me, and nearly upset the contents of my cup over the front of my immaculate white gown"
9609,"However, he had evidently made up his mind that I was no ghost, but my own solid self, for as I put my white slipper on the last step, he came forward with an out-stretched hand, and said—"
9610,"Miss Benny sniffed, glared, and backed herself away in purple wrath"
9611,"The body was of black crêpe de Chine gathered into bands of gold embroidery, the shirt of white brocade, with a thick border of Neapolitan violets;"
9612,"She had penciled, dark eyebrows, and dark gray eyes, which former afforded a striking contrast to her light locks"
9613,"She wore unusually long gloves, and brandished an enormous black feather fan, as she talked with much volubility"
9614,"she was small, slight, and dazzlingly fair, her fair skin enhanced by her black brows and lashes"
9615,"Sir Fulke, who appeared to be expecting us, was a stout, bald gentleman, with a pair of hard brown eyes and a fixed smile"
9616,"I danced with Mr. Aubrey Price (the owner of thirty hunters), and as we subsequently promenaded in the long corridor, we encountered a spare, gray-haired, gentlemanly man, who stared so fixedly at me that I felt quite uncomfortable"
9617,"Over it there stood a white cross, and just the one word ‘Gwendoline"
9618,"I am so glad you wore your white satin, darling"
9619,"I dared not put my opinion into plain, brutal words, and tell the white-faced, anxious little inquirer, that “her friend Lady Hildegarde had forgotten us!” The fire had died down"
9620,"Or, could it be possible?—she was always rather heedless—yes”—now coming over to me, and looking at me with a haggard, white face—“you are right, she must have forgotten all about us"
9621,"And Emma stood up, and clutched hold of the chimney-piece, and turned on me a face gray and drawn with mortal suffering"
9622,numbers of red-coated fox hunters trotted past on their hunters
9623,"I made my black gown, and as I sewed, I made plans"
9624,Mr. Somers—who looked very black indeed—merely bowed
9625,"Here, just tidy yourself, and let me pick the white threads off you"
9626,"And this sedate little gray-bearded gentleman, whom I had never spoken to before, drew me nearer to him and kissed me timidly"
9627,"but a beautiful, dignified, venerable pile, standing among sloping green glades and fine forest trees"
9628,A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front;
9629,"They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky;"
9630,"But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw"
9631,"he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare"
9632,"and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper;"
9633,"but she did more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret,"
9634,Her eyes were red and swollen;
9635,"As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it—and, at length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing"
9636,"The closing of the little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the door"
9637,"There is not a stone laid of Fanny’s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out"
9638,“Where is the green-house to be?”
9639,"my dear,’ says I, ‘it is nothing in the world, but the red gum;’ and nurse said just the same"
9640,"and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he saw the child, he said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy"
9641,But why should not I wear pink ribbons?
9642,"The idea of Edward’s being a clergyman, and living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;—and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous"
9643,"and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the gardener’s lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of Charlotte,—and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood, she found fresh sources of merriment"
9644,but not before I had seen Marianne’s sweet face as white as death
9645,"His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one"
9646,"In the mango grove, shade poured into his black eyes, when playing as a boy, when his mother sang, when the sacred offerings were made, when his father, the scholar, taught him, when the wise men talked"
9647,"He was said to wander through the land, teaching, surrounded by disciples, without possession, without home, without a wife, in the yellow cloak of an ascetic, but with a cheerful brow, a man of bliss, and Brahmans and princes would bow down before him and would become his students"
9648,"On many days, I have seen him, walking through the alleys in silence, wearing his yellow cloak, presenting his alms-dish in silence at the doors of the houses, leaving with a filled dish"
9649,"On all paths of the marvellous grove, monks walked in yellow robes, under the trees they sat here and there, in deep contemplation—or in a conversation about spiritual matters, the shady gardens looked like a city, full of people, bustling like bees"
9650,"He saw him, a simple man in a yellow robe, bearing the alms-dish in his hand, walking silently"
9651,"Attentively, Govinda looked at the monk in the yellow robe, who seemed to be in no way different from the hundreds of other monks"
9652,"Very early in the morning, a follower of Buddha, one of his oldest monks, went through the garden and called all those to him who had as novices taken their refuge in the teachings, to dress them up in the yellow robe and to instruct them in the first teachings and duties of their position"
9653,"All of this, all this yellow and blue, river and forest, entered Siddhartha for the first time through the eyes, was no longer a spell of Mara, was no longer the veil of Maya, was no longer a pointless and coincidental diversity of mere appearances, despicable to the deeply thinking Brahman, who scorns diversity, who seeks unity"
9654,"Blue was blue, river was river, and if also in the blue and the river, in Siddhartha, the singular and divine lived hidden, so it was still that very divinity's way and purpose, to be here yellow, here blue, there sky, there forest, and here Siddhartha"
9655,"He saw trees, stars, animals, clouds, rainbows, rocks, herbs, flowers, stream and river, the glistening dew in the bushes in the morning, distant high mountains which were blue and pale, birds sang and bees, wind silverishly blew through the rice-field"
9656,"Govinda was standing in front of him, dressed in the yellow robe of an ascetic"
9657,"When Siddhartha greeted her, she lifted her head and looked up to him with a smile, so that he saw the white in her eyes glistening"
9658,"Siddhartha felt his blood heating up, and since in this moment he had to think of his dream again, he bend slightly down to the woman and kissed with his lips the brown nipple of her breast"
9659,"In their midst, carried by four servants in an ornamental sedan-chair, sat a woman, the mistress, on red pillows under a colourful canopy"
9660,"Under black hair, which made to tower high on her head, he saw a very fair, very delicate, very smart face, a brightly red mouth, like a freshly cracked fig, eyebrows which were well tended and painted in a high arch, smart and watchful dark eyes, a clear, tall neck rising from a green and golden garment, resting fair hands, long and thin, with wide golden bracelets over the wrists"
9661,"My mouth is red and fresh as well, it will be a suitable match for yours, you'll see"
9662,"Beautiful and red is Kamala's mouth, but just try to kiss it against Kamala's will, and you will not obtain a single drop of sweetness from it, which knows how to give so many sweet things!"
9663,"Into her shady grove stepped the pretty Kamala, At the grove's entrance stood the brown Samana"
9664,"""Beautiful are your verses, oh brown Samana, and truly, I'm losing nothing when I'm giving you a kiss for them"
9665,But to the maid she gave the order to give the pious Brahman white upper garments
9666,"Be smart, brown Samana"
9667,"Kamaswami entered, a swiftly, smoothly moving man with very gray hair, with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth"
9668,"He saw them toiling, saw them suffering, and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to entirely unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being slightly honoured, he saw them scolding and insulting each other, he saw them complaining about pain at which a Samana would only smile, and suffering because of deprivations which a Samana would not feel"
9669,"Then he had lain by her side, and Kamala's face had been close to him, and under her eyes and next to the corners of her mouth he had, as clearly as never before, read a fearful inscription, an inscription of small lines, of slight grooves, an inscription reminiscent of autumn and old age, just as Siddhartha himself, who was only in his forties, had already noticed, here and there, gray hairs among his black ones"
9670,"Siddhartha leaned against its trunk with his shoulder, embraced the trunk with one arm, and looked down into the green water, which ran and ran under him, looked down and found himself to be entirely filled with the wish to let go and to drown in these waters"
9671,"Siddhartha straightened up, then he saw a person sitting opposite to him, an unknown man, a monk in a yellow robe with a shaven head, sitting in the position of pondering"
9672,"Bright pearls he saw rising from the deep, quiet bubbles of air floating on the reflecting surface, the blue of the sky being depicted in it"
9673,"With a thousand eyes, the river looked at him, with green ones, with white ones, with crystal ones, with sky-blue ones"
9674,"and from under her dress, a small, black snake fled, by which Kamala had been bitten"
9675,"Kamala's wound was washed, but had already turned black and her body was swollen, she was made to drink a healing potion"
9676,"For a long time, he sat, read in the pale face, in the tired wrinkles, filled himself with this sight, saw his own face lying in the same manner, just as white, just as quenched out, and saw at the same time his face and hers being young, with red lips, with fiery eyes, and the feeling of this both being present and at the same time real, the feeling of eternity, completely filled every aspect of his being"
9677,"For a long time, Siddhartha stood there and looked through the open gate into the garden, seeing monks in yellow robes walking among the beautiful trees"
9678,"The monks in the garden saw him, and since he crouched for many hours, and dust was gathering on his gray hair, one of them came to him and placed two bananas in front of him"
9679,"He saw the face of a fish, a carp, with an infinitely painfully opened mouth, the face of a dying fish, with fading eyes—he saw the face of a new-born child, red and full of wrinkles, distorted from crying—he saw the face of a murderer, he saw him plunging a knife into the body of another person—he saw, in the same second, this criminal in bondage, kneeling and his head being chopped off by the executioner with one blow of his sword—he saw the bodies of men and women, naked in positions and cramps of frenzied love—he saw corpses stretched out, motionless, cold, void— he saw the heads of animals, of boars, of crocodiles, of elephants, of bulls, of birds—he saw gods, saw Krishna, saw Agni—he saw all of these figures and faces in a thousand relationships with one another, each one helping the other, loving it, hating it, destroying it, giving re-birth to it, each one was a will to die, a passionately painful confession of transitoriness, and yet none of them died, each one only transformed, was always re-born, received evermore a new face, without any time having passed between the one and the other face—and all of these figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated along and merged with each other, and they were all constantly covered by something thin, without individuality of its own, but yet existing, like a thin glass or ice, like a transparent skin, a shell or mold or mask of water, and this mask was smiling, and this mask was Siddhartha's smiling face, which he, Govinda, in this very same moment touched with his lips"
9680,"“Lor bless her dear heart, no!” interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction"
9681,She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead;
9682,"“Ah, poor dear, so it is!” said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child"
9683,"and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant"
9684,"But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once—a parish child—the orphan of a workhouse—the humble, half-starved drudge—to be cuffed and buffeted through the world—despised by all, and pitied by none"
9685,"With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years"
9686,"and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table"
9687,"At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red face"
9688,whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool
9689,"“The boy is a fool—I thought he was,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat"
9690,“What are you crying for?” inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat
9691,"You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,” said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair"
9692,"“So you’ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o’clock,” added the surly one in the white waistcoat"
9693,"“That boy will be hung,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat"
9694,"“I never was more convinced of anything in my life,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning:"
9695,"As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no"
9696,"It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual’s prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other"
9697,"The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room"
9698,"and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat"
9699,"“Ay, my man,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile"
9700,"“Walk in,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat"
9701,"Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him"
9702,The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation;
9703,"“Not at all,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat"
9704,"“Ten shillings too much,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat"
9705,nonsense!” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat
9706,"He had been wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates’ powder, whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from thenceforth on that account"
9707,"That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain"
9708,"“I despise ’em,” said the beadle, growing very red in the face"
9709,"and, having had his luggage put into his hand—which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep—he pulled his cap over his eyes;"
9710,"wherein sat a slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair"
9711,"An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object:"
9712,"Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor;"
9713,"and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance"
9714,"but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls"
9715,"for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome"
9716,An old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man;
9717,"who used him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers"
9718,"and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the occasion"
9719,"You can hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along"
9720,"and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever:"
9721,"“By Jove!” exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short"
9722,"Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?” inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat"
9723,"certainly,” said the gentleman in the white waistcoat:"
9724,"“My eyes, how green!” exclaimed the young gentleman"
9725,The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt
9726,"and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair"
9727,"Five of ’em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn white-livered!”"
9728,"“He is so jolly green!” said Charley when he recovered, as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour"
9729,He was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black velvet collar;
9730,wore white trousers;
9731,"There was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened"
9732,"The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;—the kind of legs, which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them"
9733,"He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck:"
9734,"A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places, skulked into the room"
9735,"He turned from this young lady, who was gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow curl-papers, to the other female"
9736,"Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,—both articles of dress being provided from the Jew’s inexhaustible stock,—Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand"
9737,"Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered, than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat, expeditiously departed:"
9738,"a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green"
9739,The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange;
9740,"and, holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm’s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice"
9741,"I’ve been lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I’ll be content to eat my own head, sir!”"
9742,“that’s the boy who had the orange!
9743,“There’s always more or less orange-peel on the pavement in our street;
9744,directly she got up I saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light
9745,"and, opening a double eye-glass, which he wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:"
9746,"with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes;"
9747,with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes;
9748,"but he had a strong appetite for contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orange-peel;"
9749,"At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog;"
9750,"“Didn’t know, you white-livered thief!” growled Sikes"
9751,"and untying a large knot in one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet"
9752,"Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew’s red eye-brows, and a half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance"
9753,"“What the devil’s this?” said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with a white dog at his heels;"
9754,"It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon"
9755,"having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape to it:"
9756,"which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were ornamented in various ways"
9757,and that he “wished he might be busted if he warn’t as dry as a lime-basket
9758,"The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets;"
9759,"The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore;"
9760,her countenance was white and agitated;
9761,and the sky looked black and cloudy
9762,an orange neckerchief;
9763,"There are three there, Bill, with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on ’em:"
9764,"The black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs. Corney was moralising;"
9765,"“What I mean to say, Fagin,” replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face, “is, that that isn’t anything to anybody here"
9766,"The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds;"
9767,"It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces"
9768,The green damp hung upon the low walls;
9769,"and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady’s lips"
9770,"“Stop, you white-livered hound!” cried the robber, shouting after Toby Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead"
9771,"The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world;"
9772,"“An hour and twelve minutes, ma’am,” replied Mr. Giles, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon"
9773,"Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child:"
9774,"with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close;"
9775,"The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots;"
9776,"and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window:"
9777,"and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment’s notice"
9778,"Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again"
9779,"and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper:"
9780,“The white house
9781,"the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window"
9782,"Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village!"
9783,"Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight!"
9784,"Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church:"
9785,"There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows:"
9786,"and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond"
9787,and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye
9788,"There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall;"
9789,"who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick"
9790,"Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp!"
9791,"Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence"
9792,wearing white favours;
9793,"As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person"
9794,"All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots"
9795,"That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him"
9796,The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves;
9797,and the sky itself to look more blue and bright
9798,"He applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself"
9799,"And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard"
9800,"for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself"
9801,and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles
9802,"The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week’s growth"
9803,"As Noah’s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side"
9804,"“There never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old ’un without any father at all betwixt you;"
9805,"A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks"
9806,"The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes"
9807,"“I’ll swear I saw ‘coffin’ written in every page of the book in large black letters,—aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night"
9808,"“A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?” cried the gentleman"
9809,"it was at this still and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit"
9810,"His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog’s or rat’s"
9811,"“I don’t know,” replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion"
9812,"but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief—Rose Maylie’s own—and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker"
9813,"the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young—not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he was—with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least—if he had taken care;"
9814,"There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams"
9815,"the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground"
9816,"“Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat?"
9817,"The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture"
9818,His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face;
9819,"Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all—the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death"
9820,"I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye"
9821,"Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word:"
9822,"“Here!” exclaimed an Italian, whose face was concealed beneath a heavy black beard"
9823,"He approached and found a man lying there, his head enveloped in a thick gray scarf and his hands tied together with a heavy cord"
9824,"Yes, there, between the narrow folds of black leather, in the hollow centre of the small object that I had taken the precaution to place in her hands before Ganimard arrested me, it was there I had deposited Rozaine’s twenty thousand francs and Lady Jerland’s pearls and diamonds"
9825,"Arsène opened the drawer of a small table of plain white wood which, with the bed and stool, constituted all the furniture in his cell, and took therefrom two scraps of paper which he handed to Ganimard"
9826,The shell contained nothing but a small piece of blue paper
9827,"He examined it more closely, and quickly discovered something white between the leaves of tobacco"
9828,"Under the strongest light one could observe his extreme thinness, his hollow cheeks, his projecting cheek-bones, his earthen-colored face dotted with small red spots and framed in a rough, straggling beard"
9829,A tear rolled down his cheek to his gray moustache
9830,A gray overcoat—remember!
9831,"“He had a soft hat, I am sure,” repeated Madame Renaud, “and a gray overcoat"
9832,"“Yes, that is right,” replied the commissary, “the telegram says he wore a gray overcoat with a black velvet collar"
9833,"“Exactly, a black velvet collar,” exclaimed Madame Renaud, triumphantly"
9834,"True, I had the consolation of learning that a man wearing a gray overcoat with a black velvet collar had taken the train at the station"
9835,"Two or three times each year, on occasions of unusual importance, such as the balls at the Austrian Embassy or the soirées of Lady Billingstone, the Countess de Dreux-Soubise wore upon her white shoulders “The Queen’s Necklace"
9836,"Then, having placed it in its case of red leather, stamped with the Cardinal’s arms, he passed into an adjoining room which was simply an alcove or cabinet that had been cut off from their chamber, and which could be entered only by means of a door at the foot of their bed"
9837,"Four days later, the countess de Dreux found upon the table in her chamber a red leather case bearing the cardinal’s arms"
9838,"Instead of the paper-knife with which I had marked my place on the preceding, I found an envelope, closed with five seals of red wax"
9839,"The extreme point of each of the seven red spots or hearts was pierced by a hole, round and regular as if made with the point of an awl"
9840,"I had discovered, sticking in the earth, a small piece of iron cut in the form of a rectangle, on which I thought I could see red spots"
9841,"That little iron plate was the exact size of a playing-card, and the red spots, made with red lead, were arranged upon it in a manner similar to the seven-of-hearts, and each spot was pierced with a round hole similar to the perforations in the two playing cards"
9842,the same cadaverous face covered with a black beard
9843,"Then Daspry held up, before Varin’s bewildered eyes, the little iron plate, marked with the seven red spots"
9844,His cravat was a black ribbon pinned with a false diamond
9845,you know the place in which the countess hides the black pearl
9846,"Therefore, in order to secure the black pearl, you have simply to be more silent than silence, more invisible than darkness itself"
9847,"On the table, there was a box of letter-paper, and the black pearl was concealed in that box"
9848,"He stared at those fixed eyes, that grim mouth, that livid flesh, and that blood—all that blood which had flowed over the carpet and congealed there in thick, black spots"
9849,“And the black pearl?” he murmured
9850,"With the countess lying cold and dead, and the black pearl vanished, the situation is anything but pleasant"
9851,"Of all that marvelous collection, nothing remained except the famous black pearl"
9852,The black pearl!
9853,the black pearl was the gift of an emperor!
9854,The black pearl never left her possession
9855,"“It is supposed that, after dinner, in place of going to his own room, Danègre slipped into the wardrobe-closet, and, through the glass door, had seen the countess hide the precious black pearl"
9856,"De Sinclèves, the cousin and sole heiress of the countess, declared that the countess, a month before her death, had written a letter to her and in it described the manner in which the black pearl was concealed"
9857,“To recover the black pearl
9858,"But if they had done so, they would have found on the white plaster a faint red spot, quite distinct, however, to trace in it the imprint of your thumb which you had pressed against the wall while it was wet with blood"
9859,The black pearl—a fortune!
9860,Then he abstracted the black pearl from its filthy hiding-place
9861,"“And that is how crime is always punished and virtue rewarded,” said Arsène Lupin, after he had told me the foregoing history of the black pearl"
9862,"He might have descended to the lowest depths of vice and crime, if he had retained the black pearl"
9863,“And you have the black pearl
9864,"The moon appeared through a rift in the clouds, and filled the drawing-room with its bright white light"
9865,"’ Then, you carried a rose in your hand, a white rose like the one you carry to-day"
9866,"Upon the box which contained the bamboo, beside which Nelly had been standing, he saw the rose, the white rose which he had desired but dared not ask for"
9867,"Because men, groping in the Arctic darkness, had found a yellow metal, and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find, thousands of men were rushing into the Northland"
9868,"There were great stables, where a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants’ cottages, an endless and orderly array of outhouses, long grape arbors, green pastures, orchards, and berry patches"
9869,"A stout man, with a red sweater that sagged generously at the neck, came out and signed the book for the driver"
9870,"Wherever the hatchet fell on the outside, he was there on the inside, snarling and growling, as furiously anxious to get out as the man in the red sweater was calmly intent on getting him out"
9871,"“Now, you red-eyed devil,” he said, when he had made an opening sufficient for the passage of Buck’s body"
9872,"And Buck was truly a red-eyed devil, as he drew himself together for the spring, hair bristling, mouth foaming, a mad glitter in his blood-shot eyes"
9873,"He lay where he had fallen, and from there he watched the man in the red sweater"
9874,"and, one and all, he watched them pass under the dominion of the man in the red sweater"
9875,"Now and again men came, strangers, who talked excitedly, wheedlingly, and in all kinds of fashions to the man in the red sweater"
9876,"“Three hundred, and a present at that,” was the prompt reply of the man in the red sweater"
9877,"That was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as Curly and he looked at receding Seattle from the deck of the Narwhal, it was the last he saw of the warm Southland"
9878,Curly and he were taken below by Perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called François
9879,"At the first step upon the cold surface, Buck’s feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud"
9880,More of this white stuff was falling through the air
9881,"The tent, illumined by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain;"
9882,"Ere he landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went for a stroll with Manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night before"
9883,"Always, they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them"
9884,But the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a more fundamental and primitive code
9885,"and he came because men had found a yellow metal in the North, and because Manuel was a gardener’s helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers small copies of himself"
9886,"Driving snow, a wind that cut like a white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping place"
9887,"Then he was a masterful dog, and what made him dangerous was the fact that the club of the man in the red sweater had knocked all blind pluck and rashness out of his desire for mastery"
9888,but Buck was too clever ever again to be caught red-handed
9889,"He lay down low to the race, whining eagerly, his splendid body flashing forward, leap by leap, in the wan white moonlight"
9890,"The rabbit could not turn, and as the white teeth broke its back in mid air it shrieked as loudly as a stricken man may shriek"
9891,"He seemed to remember it all,—the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the thrill of battle"
9892,In vain Buck strove to sink his teeth in the neck of the big white dog
9893,"There was a crunch of breaking bone, and the white dog faced him on three legs"
9894,"Buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly;"
9895,"but oftener he remembered the man in the red sweater, the death of Curly, the great fight with Spitz, and the good things he had eaten or would like to eat"
9896,The man in the red sweater had proved that
9897,"Nig, equally friendly, though less demonstrative, was a huge black dog, half bloodhound and half deerhound, with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature"
9898,"He sat by John Thornton’s fire, a broad-breasted dog, white-fanged and long-furred;"
9899,"But as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade, the love for John Thornton drew him back to the fire again"
9900,"Summer arrived, and dogs and men packed on their backs, rafted across blue mountain lakes, and descended or ascended unknown rivers in slender boats whipsawed from the standing forest"
9901,"Spring came on once more, and at the end of all their wandering they found, not the Lost Cabin, but a shallow placer in a broad valley where the gold showed like yellow butter across the bottom of the washing-pan"
9902,"He would thrust his nose into the cool wood moss, or into the black soil where long grasses grew, and snort with joy at the fat earth smells;"
9903,"He fished for salmon in a broad stream that emptied somewhere into the sea, and by this stream he killed a large black bear, blinded by the mosquitoes while likewise fishing, and raging through the forest helpless and terrible"
9904,"But for the stray brown on his muzzle and above his eyes, and for the splash of white hair that ran midmost down his chest, he might well have been mistaken for a gigantic wolf, larger than the largest of the breed"
9905,"At such moments, panting with red lolling tongue and with eyes fixed upon the big bull, it appeared to Buck that a change was coming over the face of things"
9906,"One only he saw,—a sleek gray fellow, flattened against a gray dead limb so that he seemed a part of it, a woody excrescence upon the wood itself"
9907,"The tongues of all were out and lolling, the white fangs showing cruelly white in the moonlight"
9908,"for some were seen with splashes of brown on head and muzzle, and with a rift of white centring down the chest"
9909,"Here a yellow stream flows from rotted moose-hide sacks and sinks into the ground, with long grasses growing through it and vegetable mould overrunning it and hiding its yellow from the sun;"
9910,"Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another"
9911,"Basil was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him"
9912,"She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes"
9913,"She wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head"
9914,"She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her thin little black-gloved hands in her lap"
9915,"Her black dress made her look yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crêpe hat"
9916,"She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes"
9917,And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever
9918,The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them
9919,"Mary felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land"
9920,"As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked"
9921,“I dare say it’s because there’s such a lot o’ blacks there instead o’ respectable white people
9922,When I heard you was comin’ from India I thought you was a black too
9923,I’ve never seen a black an’ I was fair pleased to think I was goin’ to see one close
9924,"An’ there you was,” disappointedly, “no more black than me—for all you’re so yeller"
9925,"She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with cool approval:"
9926,"He said ‘I won’t have a child dressed in black wanderin’ about like a lost soul,’ he said"
9927,She doesn’t hold with black hersel’
9928,"“I hate black things,” said Mary"
9929,"There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst"
9930,"She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood open"
9931,"She saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables"
9932,"“What is that?” said Mary, pointing through the other green door"
9933,She went down the path and through the second green door
9934,"There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open"
9935,"As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle"
9936,"There were walls all round it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass—but there was no green door to be seen anywhere"
9937,"She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his winter song—almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her"
9938,A bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he sang
9939,"She heard a soft little rushing flight through the air—and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener’s foot"
9940,The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop
9941,Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity
9942,"He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed"
9944,But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it
9945,There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere
9946,She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning
9947,"But one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire"
9948,She looked at the red fire and listened to the wind “wutherin’
9949,"The next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud"
9950,She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger
9951,"The bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there"
9952,"She felt as if she had been on a long journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion"
9953,The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind
9954,"The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland"
9955,"this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece"
9956,The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray
9957,"no!” said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes"
9958,"Just you wait till you see th’ gold-colored gorse blossoms an’ th’ blossoms o’ th’ broom, an’ th’ heather flowerin’, all purple bells, an’ hundreds o’ butterflies flutterin’ an’ bees hummin’ an’ skylarks soarin’ up an’ singin’"
9959,"The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and float about"
9960,You’ll see bits o’ green spikes stickin’ out o’ th’ black earth after a bit
9961,"Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,” said Mary"
9962,His red waistcoat was like satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a robin could be
9963,"Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing but thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves"
9964,She had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit of brown sugar in it
9965,"Just as he was goin’ away our ’Lizabeth Ellen called out, ‘Mother, he’s got skippin’-ropes with red an’ blue handles"
9966,"It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at each end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before"
9967,Tha’s skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name’s Ben Weatherstaff
9968,All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry brown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes if they were alive
9969,"There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary did not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading over everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had fallen from their fastenings and run along the ground"
9970,She walked under one of the fairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays and tendrils which formed them
9971,"If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood was alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only gray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a tiny leaf-bud anywhere"
9972,The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky over this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant and soft than it was over the moor
9973,"There had once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw something sticking out of the black earth—some sharp little pale green points"
9974,"She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and after she had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so many more sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited again"
9975,"She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their way through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow"
9976,"The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coat off, and then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down on to the grass and the pale green points all the time"
9977,"and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green points were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them"
9978,She had such red cheeks and such bright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted
9979,In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had found herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion
9980,"“Martha,” she said, “what are those white roots that look like onions?”"
9981,Th’ biggest of all is lilies an’ purple flags
9982,To think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue!
9983,She found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find
9984,His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces
9985,"“When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?” inquired Mary"
9986,"“Look along th’ twigs an’ branches an’ if tha’ see a bit of a brown lump swelling here an’ there, watch it after th’ warm rain an’ see what happens"
9987,He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy’s face
9988,"And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses—and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make"
9989,An’ th’ woman in th’ shop threw in a packet o’ white poppy an’ one o’ blue larkspur when I bought th’ other seeds
9990,She liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy
9991,They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket
9992,And she felt as if she went red and then pale
9993,It was true that she had turned red and then pale
9994,Dickon’s curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder
9995,"His eyes seemed to be taking in everything—the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them"
9996,"He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and his round eyes looked queerly happy"
9997,"He stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichen all over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches"
9998,"This here’s a new bit,” and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead of hard, dry gray"
9999,There’s green in that wood yet
10000,"He was very strong and clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it"
10001,It was one of Mary’s own little clearings round the pale green points
10002,I’m as tough as a white-thorn knobstick
10003,"“Eh!” he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was sniffing up the scent of it"
10004,"He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose"
10005,"He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief"
10006,"She had on her best black dress and cap, and her collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man’s face on it"
10007,All the pink left Mary’s cheeks
10008,"She could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high, rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with white"
10009,"His black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her"
10010,Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye
10011,"Then she crept across the room, and, as she drew nearer, the light attracted the boy’s attention and he turned his head on his pillow and stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemed immense"
10012,They were agate gray and they looked too big for his face because they had black lashes all round them
10013,They are working in the earth now—pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming
10014,"She had bright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were exactly like Colin’s unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big as they really were because of the black lashes all round them"
10015,"“That is nice,” he said more drowsily still, and she went on chanting and stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes were lying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fast asleep"
10016,Martha’s face became red with fright
10017,There were rich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the walls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray sky and falling rain
10018,He had a red spot on each cheek
10019,He has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about
10020,And he laughs such a big laugh with his wide mouth—and his cheeks are as red—as red as cherries
10021,And about Dickon’s mother—and the skipping-rope—and the moor with the sun on it—and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod
10022,Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr. Craven’s face
10023,After another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and the sun which poured down was quite hot
10024,“Tha’rt not half so ugly when it’s that way an’ there’s a bit o’ red in tha’ cheeks
10025,On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very early
10026,The moor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happened to it
10027,"“It will make the green points push up and up and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with all their might under the earth"
10028,“The little clouds are all pink and I’ve never seen the sky look like this
10029,She clasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so blue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light that she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that thrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it
10030,“The grass is greener and things are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green buds of leaves are showing
10031,There were things sprouting and pushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually here and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the stems of crocuses
10032,"It was the caw—caw of a crow and it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sat a big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wisely indeed"
10033,They had come upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and gold
10034,He showed her ten thousand new green points pushing through the mould
10035,they dug and pulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary’s hair was as tumbled as Dickon’s and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his
10036,"Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted through the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of red-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak"
10037,"But he had said the queer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the world, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she watched him for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves"
10038,When she described the small ivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook his head
10039,"“Why!” she cried, “the gray wall is changing"
10040,It is as if a green mist were creeping over it
10042,Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away over the tree-tops in the park
10043,She felt so sour and unrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about Dickon and the green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down from the moor
10044,"His face looked dreadful, white and red and swollen, and he was gasping and choking;"
10045,I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground—almost like a strange gray mist
10046,“Perhaps they are coming up through the grass—perhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones—even now
10047,Perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl—and perhaps—the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping—and creeping over—everything
10048,His face was pitifully white and there were dark circles round his eyes
10049,"I heard you say something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was standing in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves—and there were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still"
10050,"Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray eyes seemed to be staring at the wall, but Mary saw he was thinking"
10051,"“Well, it was rather funny to say it,” she admitted frankly, “because his nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have patches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but—but if an angel did come to Yorkshire and live on the moor—if there was a Yorkshire angel—I believe he’d understand the green things and know how to make them grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon does and they’d know he was friends for sure"
10052,"He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred and he always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his bed, sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into fresh sobbing at the least word"
10053,"“Those long spires of blue ones—we’ll have a lot of those,” Colin was announcing"
10054,"She says, ‘Once when I was givin’ th’ children a bit of a preach after they’d been fightin’ I ses to ’em all, “When I was at school my jography told as th’ world was shaped like a orange an’ I found out before I was ten that th’ whole orange doesn’t belong to nobody"
10055,"But don’t you—none o’ you—think as you own th’ whole orange or you’ll find out you’re mistaken, an’ you won’t find it out without hard knocks"
10056,"She had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was bright with the air and pink-cheeked, though he could not see it"
10057,“And there are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil has covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about their nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even fighting for places in the secret garden
10058,The new-born lamb was in his arms and the little red fox trotted by his side
10059,"“Come on, little ’un,” he said, turning the small woolly white head with a gentle brown hand"
10060,But at last I seed a bit o’ white by a rock on top o’ th’ moor an’ I climbed up an’ found th’ little ’un half dead wi’ cold an’ clemmin’
10061,They’ll look like a bed o’ blue an’ white butterflies flutterin’ when they’re out
10062,"“If he does live and that Indian child stays here I’ll warrant she teaches him that the whole orange does not belong to him, as Susan Sowerby says"
10063,"And if all the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creatures danced past at once, what a crowd it would be!"
10064,The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed like white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness
10065,"And this is the ivy the wind blew back,” and she took hold of the hanging green curtain"
10066,"And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and tendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in the grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here and there everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white and the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there were fluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and scents"
10067,He looked so strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually crept all over him—ivory face and neck and hands and all
10068,Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure;
10069,"There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose buds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide"
10070,Between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked down like wonderful eyes
10071,"“The branches are quite gray and there’s not a single leaf anywhere,” Colin went on"
10072,"Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash of red-breasted bird with something in his beak"
10073,"He had gone on rubbing his rust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to grow in his blue eyes"
10074,"It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth was spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets, a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into investigating crumbs with great activity"
10075,Soot had perched on a low branch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his eyes
10076,A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes which came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coach because a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his great black-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him
10077,His red old eyes fixed themselves on what was before him as if he were seeing a ghost
10078,"Tha’rt as thin as a lath an’ as white as a wraith, but there’s not a knob on thee"
10079,Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper and wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it
10080,The thin white hands shook a little and Colin’s flush grew deeper as he set the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth
10081,It’s as white as snow
10082,"At first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the crevices of the walls"
10083,"Then the green things began to show buds and the buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every shade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson"
10084,"Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas"
10085,"“She liked them things as was allus pointin’ up to th’ blue sky, she used to tell"
10086,She just loved it but she said as th’ blue sky allus looked so joyful
10087,Even gray days pleased him
10088,Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held a long-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly while it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself
10089,"Soot had pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder, the gray film dropped over his eyes"
10090,"Ben Weatherstaff walked behind, and the “creatures” trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping to nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt himself in charge"
10091,"So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal"
10092,She asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deep thinking
10093,"Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with her"
10094,"The morning that Dickon—after they had been enjoying themselves in the garden for about two hours—went behind a big rosebush and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness"
10095,Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended
10096,The first moment he set his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger but a sort of robin without beak or feathers
10097,They looked at the portraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and holding the parrot on her finger
10098,"I’m well!” said Colin again, and his face went quite red all over"
10099,"With the ivy behind her, the sunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak, and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather like a softly colored illustration in one of Colin’s books"
10100,But before he got into his chair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with a kind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold of her blue cloak and held it fast
10101,All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him with her warm arms close against the bosom under the blue cloak—as if he had been Dickon’s brother
10102,"So long as Mistress Mary’s mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child"
10103,"When her mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boy and his “creatures,” there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow and tired"
10104,He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them;
10105,he had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them
10106,There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things years ago
10107,He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were
10108,"But, strange as it seemed to him, there were minutes—sometimes half-hours—when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one"
10109,"Now and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes"
10110,One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon was high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver
10111,He remembered the black days when he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was dead
10112,"The first time after a year’s absence he returned to Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had adored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death"
10113,But he knew nothing of Magic—either black or white
10114,"Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he awoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot"
10115,"Why did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been sure he could never feel again—that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing, nearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six hundred years?"
10116,He threw the thick hair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes—eyes full of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe
10117,The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue and flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standing together—lilies which were white or white and ruby
10118,inPg America they are the whole white population;
10119,"He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes he had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his sword-hilt"
10120,"“He looks just like an angel,” said the Charity Children as they came out of the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white pinafores"
10121,"He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her"
10122,"Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress"
10123,"He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices"
10124,"Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves"
10125,"He passed by the cathedral tower, where the white marble angels were sculptured"
10126,At noon the yellow lions come down to the water’s edge to drink
10127,"They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract"
10128,"His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes"
10129,"In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them"
10130,"My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other"
10131,"The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea"
10132,"He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks;"
10133,"of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal;"
10134,"of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies"
10135,"He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets"
10136,"“She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,” cried the young Student;"
10137,“but in all my garden there is no red rose
10138,"“No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes filled with tears"
10139,"“Ah, on what little things does happiness depend! I have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of philosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made wretched"
10140,"His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow"
10141,If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn
10142,"If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine"
10143,"But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by"
10144,"But with me she will not dance, for I have no red rose to give her”;"
10145,"“He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale"
10146,“For a red rose?” they cried;
10147,"Suddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air"
10148,"“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song"
10149,"“as white as the foam of the sea, and whiter than the snow upon the mountain"
10150,"“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song"
10151,"“as yellow as the hair of the mermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the daffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with his scythe"
10152,"“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest song"
10153,"“My roses are red,” it answered, “as red as the feet of the dove, and redder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean-cavern"
10154,"“One red rose is all I want,” cried the Nightingale, “only one red rose! Is there no way by which I can get it?”"
10155,"“If you want a red rose,” said the Tree, “you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with your own heart’s-blood"
10156,"“Death is a great price to pay for a red rose,” cried the Nightingale, “and Life is very dear to all"
10157,"It is pleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his chariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl"
10158,"So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air"
10159,you shall have your red rose
10160,"And a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like the flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of the bride"
10161,"The white Moon heard it, and she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky"
10162,"The red rose heard it, and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened its petals to the cold morning air"
10163,"Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the hills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams"
10164,"“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!” he cried; “here is a red rose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life"
10165,"The daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding blue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet"
10166,"“You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red rose,” cried the Student"
10167,"It was a large lovely garden, with soft green grass"
10168,"Here and there over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars, and there were twelve peach-trees that in the spring-time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in the autumn bore rich fruit"
10169,"” The Snow covered up the grass with her great white cloak, and the Frost painted all the trees silver"
10170,"“I cannot understand why the Spring is so late in coming,” said the Selfish Giant, as he sat at the window and looked out at his cold white garden;"
10171,"The birds were flying about and twittering with delight, and the flowers were looking up through the green grass and laughing"
10172,In the farthest corner of the garden was a tree quite covered with lovely white blossoms
10173,"And when he came quite close his face grew red with anger, and he said, “Who hath dared to wound thee?” For on the palms of the child’s hands were the prints of two nails, and the prints of two nails were on the little feet"
10174,"And when the children ran in that afternoon, they found the Giant lying dead under the tree, all covered with white blossoms"
10175,He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber
10176,"The little ducks were swimming about in the pond, looking just like a lot of yellow canaries, and their mother, who was pure white with real red legs, was trying to teach them how to stand on their heads in the water"
10177,"There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white"
10178,"‘If poor Hans is in trouble I will give him half my porridge, and show him my white rabbits"
10179,"Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody’s nature"
10180,"He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered ‘Pooh!’ But pray go on with your story"
10181,"“Well,” said the Linnet, hopping now on one leg and now on the other, “as soon as the winter was over, and the primroses began to open their pale yellow stars, the Miller said to his wife that he would go down and see little Hans"
10182,"“What a dreadful storm it was! The night was so black that little Hans could hardly see, and the wind was so strong that he could scarcely stand"
10183,"so he walked at the head of the procession in a long black cloak, and every now and then he wiped his eyes with a big pocket-handkerchief"
10184,"“She is like a white rose!” they cried, and they threw down flowers on her from the balconies"
10185,"He had dreamy violet eyes, and his hair was like fine gold"
10186,"“She was like a white rose before,” said a young Page to his neighbour, “but she is like a red rose now”;"
10187,"It was a magnificent ceremony, and the bride and bridegroom walked hand in hand under a canopy of purple velvet embroidered with little pearls"
10188,“Just look at those yellow tulips
10189,"I heard all about them this morning from a brown-paper cartridge, who happened to be staying in the same drawer as myself, and knew the latest Court news"
10190,"When she made her great public appearance she spun round nineteen times before she went out, and each time that she did so she threw into the air seven pink stars"
10191,"Why, perhaps the Prince and Princess may go to live in a country where there is a deep river, and perhaps they may have one only son, a little fair-haired boy with violet eyes like the Prince himself;"
10192,"They danced so beautifully that the tall white lilies peeped in at the window and watched them, and the great red poppies nodded their heads and beat time"
10193,"“Good-bye,” cried the Fire-balloon, as he soared away, dropping tiny blue sparks"
10194,"Then a little Frog, with bright jewelled eyes, and a green mottled coat, swam up to him"
10195,"Do you think it will be a wet afternoon? I am sure I hope so, but the sky is quite blue and cloudless"
10196,"“There is no good talking to him,” said a Dragon-fly, who was sitting on the top of a large brown bulrush; “no good at all, for he has gone away"
10197,"She had yellow legs, and webbed feet, and was considered a great beauty on account of her waddle"
10198,"and he sank a little deeper still into the mud, and began to think about the loneliness of genius, when suddenly two little boys in white smocks came running down the bank, with a kettle and some faggots"
10199,There were several colors on the same bed—reds and creamy whites and one lot of a striking orange color
10200,"I had dinner and a pipe and then set out along the well-remembered, maple shaded lane of Spring Street, past the old Sutherland place at the corner of Eagle, where a scrawny hedge had replaced the old white picket fence;"
10201,past the Jones house with its neat lawn and big red barn
10202,"To the waist it was literally patched with little pockets, and every pocket was stuffed with rich black dirt out of which rose the leaves and stems of seedling plants in various stages of maturity"
10203,Some were no more than green buttons and some were well leafed out
10204,I remembered the curve of a dark cheek—the quirk of a pair of soft red lips—the sidelong glance of black eyes
10205,"He went down the aisle, moistening the soil around one plant, stroking another's trembling leaves, feeding a third with lime or potash or some other stuff from the palette"
10206,"The shape the things took seemed to depend on the kind of soil they were in, but the young plants were all alike, tiny and green and shapeless, much like the embryo of any animal"
10207,He looked like some medieval sorcerer in his long black robe with its scores of little pockets stuffed with growing plants
10208,"He touched one gorgeous purple bloom and it stiffened under his hand like a cat, but with the slow, painful motion of something which has no right to move"
10209,"On the taboret beside his chair, at the left of the great tiled fireplace, was a squat black urn, and in it—the plant"
10210,"""Faustus, I have heard much of thee, that thou art excellent in the black art, and none like thee in mine empire;"
10211,"in proportion, a strong set thicke man, of a middle stature, blacke haire, and that both thicke and curled, head and beard, red cheekes, and a broad face, with eyes like a basiliske;"
10212,"where incontinent he had his dish full of all manner of fruit, as red and white grapes, peares, and apples, the which came from out of strange countries:"
10213,"""This lady appeared before them in a most rich gowne of purple velvet, costly imbrodered;"
10214,"having most amorous cole-black eyes, a sweet and pleasant round face, with lips as red as a cherry;"
10215,"her cheekes of a rose colour, her mouth small, her neck white like a swan;"
10216,But what a governess!” (He vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of Mlle
10217,"“Then we shall see,” Stepan Arkadyevitch said to himself, and getting up he put on a gray dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the tassels in a knot, and, drawing a deep breath of air into his broad, bare chest, he walked to the window with his usual confident step, turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily"
10218,"“Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,” he said, checking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a pink path through his long, curly whiskers"
10219,"He read, too, that Count Beist was rumored to have left for Wiesbaden, and that one need have no more gray hair, and of the sale of a light carriage, and of a young person seeking a situation;"
10220,"In him, in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling eyes, black hair and eyebrows, and the white and red of his face, there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him"
10221,"Levin was silent, looking at the unknown faces of Oblonsky’s two companions, and especially at the hand of the elegant Grinevitch, which had such long white fingers, such long yellow filbert-shaped nails, and such huge shining studs on the shirt-cuff, that apparently they absorbed all his attention, and allowed him no freedom of thought"
10222,"why at certain hours all the three young ladies, with Mademoiselle Linon, drove in the coach to the Tversky boulevard, dressed in their satin cloaks, Dolly in a long one, Natalia in a half-long one, and Kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in tightly-drawn red stockings were visible to all beholders;"
10223,"The tradition is kept up here that you are the best of skaters,” she said, with her little black-gloved hand brushing a grain of hoarfrost off her muff"
10224,"Lord help me!” thought Levin, and he flew towards the old Frenchwoman with the gray ringlets, who was sitting on a bench"
10225,"Your excellency won’t be disturbed here,” said a particularly pertinacious, white-headed old Tatar with immense hips and coat-tails gaping widely behind"
10226,Do you like the white seal?”
10227,"Levin ate the oysters indeed, though white bread and cheese would have pleased him better"
10228,"Even the Tatar, uncorking the bottle and pouring the sparkling wine into the delicate glasses, glanced at Stepan Arkadyevitch, and settled his white cravat with a perceptible smile of satisfaction"
10229,"She was a thin, sallow, sickly, and nervous woman, with brilliant black eyes"
10230,"So you’ve come back to our corrupt Babylon,” she said, giving him her tiny, yellow hand, and recalling what he had chanced to say early in the winter, that Moscow was a Babylon"
10231,"Everything about his face and figure, from his short-cropped black hair and freshly shaven chin down to his loosely fitting, brand-new uniform, was simple and at the same time elegant"
10232,"Her shining gray eyes, that looked dark from the thick lashes, rested with friendly attention on his face, as though she were recognizing him, and then promptly turned away to the passing crowd, as though seeking someone"
10233,"In that brief look Vronsky had time to notice the suppressed eagerness which played over her face, and flitted between the brilliant eyes and the faint smile that curved her red lips"
10234,"His mother, a dried-up old lady with black eyes and ringlets, screwed up her eyes, scanning her son, and smiled slightly with her thin lips"
10235,"When Anna went into the room, Dolly was sitting in the little drawing-room with a white-headed fat little boy, already like his father, giving him a lesson in French reading"
10236,"She took off her kerchief and her hat, and catching it in a lock of her black hair, which was a mass of curls, she tossed her head and shook her hair down"
10237,"“I remember, and I know that blue haze like the mist on the mountains in Switzerland"
10238,"The ball was only just beginning as Kitty and her mother walked up the great staircase, flooded with light, and lined with flowers and footmen in powder and red coats"
10239,"A little old man in civilian dress, arranging his gray curls before another mirror, and diffusing an odor of scent, stumbled against them on the stairs, and stood aside, evidently admiring Kitty, whom he did not know"
10240,"A beardless youth, one of those society youths whom the old Prince Shtcherbatsky called “young bucks,” in an exceedingly open waistcoat, straightening his white tie as he went, bowed to them, and after running by, came back to ask Kitty for a quadrille"
10241,"Although her dress, her coiffure, and all the preparations for the ball had cost Kitty great trouble and consideration, at this moment she walked into the ballroom in her elaborate tulle dress over a pink slip as easily and simply as though all the rosettes and lace, all the minute details of her attire, had not cost her or her family a moment’s attention, as though she had been born in that tulle and lace, with her hair done up high on her head, and a rose and two leaves on the top of it"
10242,"her pink slippers with high, hollowed-out heels did not pinch, but gladdened her feet;"
10243,The black velvet of her locket nestled with special softness round her neck
10244,"” Bending her left hand, she laid it on his shoulder, and her little feet in their pink slippers began swiftly, lightly, and rhythmically moving over the slippery floor in time to the music"
10245,"There, too, she descried Stiva, and there she saw the exquisite figure and head of Anna in a black velvet gown"
10246,"On her head, among her black hair—her own, with no false additions—was a little wreath of pansies, and a bouquet of the same in the black ribbon of her sash among white lace"
10247,"And her black dress, with its sumptuous lace, was not noticeable on her;"
10248,"My wife and I are like white wolves—everyone knows us,” answered Korsunsky"
10249,"can it be he?” Every time he spoke to Anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes, and the smile of happiness curved her red lips"
10250,"one bare, thin, soft, girlish arm, hanging listlessly, was lost in the folds of her pink tunic;"
10251,"She was fascinating in her simple black dress, fascinating were her round arms with their bracelets, fascinating was her firm neck with its thread of pearls, fascinating the straying curls of her loose hair, fascinating the graceful, light movements of her little feet and hands, fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness, but there was something terrible and cruel in her fascination"
10252,"“Yes, of course,” said Konstantin, looking at the patch of red that had come out on his brother’s projecting cheekbones"
10253,"He caught a glimpse of the broad, smooth, black and piebald back of Hollandka"
10254,"Levin went into the pen, looked Pava over, and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her long, tottering legs"
10255,"It’s particulary nice if Pava’s daughter should be a red-spotted cow, and all the herd will take after her, and the other three, too!"
10256,"And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing up to her ears, up to the curly black ringlets on her neck"
10257,"With her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag, took out a cushion, laid it on her knees, and carefully wrapping up her feet, settled herself comfortably"
10258,"Annushka was already dozing, the red bag on her lap, clutched by her broad hands, in gloves, of which one was torn"
10259,"That peasant with the long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall, the old lady began stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage, and filling it with a black cloud;"
10260,then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything
10261,"He knew that she had a husband, but had hardly believed in his existence, and only now fully believed in him, with his head and shoulders, and his legs clad in black trousers;"
10262,"But even as he was, he was charming, with his fair curls, his blue eyes, and his plump, graceful little legs in tightly pulled-up stockings"
10263,"The Countess Lidia Ivanovna was a tall, stout woman, with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid, pensive black eyes"
10264,"Precisely at five o’clock, before the bronze Peter the First clock had struck the fifth stroke, Alexey Alexandrovitch came in, wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars, as he had to go out directly after dinner"
10265,"“Impossible!” he cried, letting down the pedal of the washing basin in which he had been sousing his healthy red neck"
10266,"When now her glance met his blue kindly eyes looking intently at her, it seemed to her that he saw right through her, and understood all that was not good that was passing within her"
10267,"When she went into Kitty’s little room, a pretty, pink little room, full of knick-knacks in vieux saxe, as fresh, and pink, and white, and gay as Kitty herself had been two months ago, Dolly remembered how they had decorated the room the year before together, with what love and gaiety"
10268,"They get a glimpse of red lips under a short veil, and exquisite little feet"
10269,"All at once a gentleman appears with whiskers like sausages, as red as a lobster, announces that there is no one living in the flat except his wife, and sends them both about their business"
10270,"Almost at the same instant the hostess, with freshly arranged coiffure and freshened face, walked in at one door and her guests at the other door of the drawing-room, a large room with dark walls, downy rugs, and a brightly lighted table, gleaming with the light of candles, white cloth, silver samovar, and transparent china tea-things"
10271,"one round the samovar near the hostess, the other at the opposite end of the drawing-room, round the handsome wife of an ambassador, in black velvet, with sharply defined black eyebrows"
10272,"No one can possibly say anything new about her,” said a fat, red-faced, flaxen-headed lady, without eyebrows and chignon, wearing an old silk dress"
10273,"“and very nasty sauce it was, some green mess"
10274,"On Thursday the wind dropped, and a thick gray fog brooded over the land as though hiding the mysteries of the transformations that were being wrought in nature"
10275,Larks trilled unseen above the velvety green fields and the ice-covered stubble-land;
10276,"The cowherd girls, picking up their petticoats, ran splashing through the mud with bare legs, still white, not yet brown from the sun, waving brush wood in their hands, chasing the calves that frolicked in the mirth of spring"
10277,"It had survived everything, and stood up vividly green through the broken stalks of last year’s wheat"
10278,"the herb brandy, and the bread, and the butter, and above all the salt goose and the mushrooms, and the nettle soup, and the chicken in white sauce, and the white Crimean wine—everything was superb and delicious"
10279,"He stood, listened, and gazed sometimes down at the wet mossy ground, sometimes at Laska listening all alert, sometimes at the sea of bare tree tops that stretched on the slope below him, sometimes at the darkening sky, covered with white streaks of cloud"
10280,"Stepan Arkadyevitch’s figure again went behind the bush, and Levin saw nothing but the bright flash of a match, followed by the red glow and blue smoke of a cigarette"
10281,"Levin looked about him to right and to left, and there, just facing him against the dusky blue sky above the confused mass of tender shoots of the aspens, he saw the flying bird"
10282,"the long beak and neck of the bird could be seen, and at the very instant when Levin was taking aim, behind the bush where Oblonsky stood, there was a flash of red lightning:"
10283,"Again came the red flash and the sound of a blow, and fluttering its wings as though trying to keep up in the air, the bird halted, stopped still an instant, and fell with a heavy splash on the slushy ground"
10284,"Venus, bright and silvery, shone with her soft light low down in the west behind the birch trees, and high up in the east twinkled the red lights of Arcturus"
10285,"Venus had risen above the branch, and the ear of the Great Bear with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky, yet still he waited"
10286,"He was dressed in a long-skirted blue coat, with buttons below the waist at the back, and wore high boots wrinkled over the ankles and straight over the calf, with big galoshes drawn over them"
10287,"He sat with his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat, resting both elbows on the table, and while waiting for the steak he had ordered he looked at a French novel that lay open on his plate"
10288,"and his black eyes shining, he plucked at his left mustache, and began twisting it into his mouth, a bad habit he had"
10289,"Just as he was passing along the passage, the boy opened the door into the second horse-box on the left, and Vronsky caught a glimpse of a big chestnut horse with white legs"
10290,"Her clean-cut head, with prominent, bright, spirited eyes, broadened out at the open nostrils, that showed the red blood in the cartilage within"
10291,"Directly Vronsky went towards her, she drew in a deep breath, and, turning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot, she started at the approaching figures from the opposite side, shaking her muzzle, and shifting lightly from one leg to the other"
10292,"She drew a loud breath and snorted out through her tense nostrils, started, pricked up her sharp ear, and put out her strong, black lip towards Vronsky, as though she would nip hold of his sleeve"
10293,"Dressed in a white gown, deeply embroidered, she was sitting in a corner of the terrace behind some flowers, and did not hear him"
10294,"Bending her curly black head, she pressed her forehead against a cool watering pot that stood on the parapet, and both her lovely hands, with the rings he knew so well, clasped the pot"
10295,"Going towards the stable, he met the white-legged chestnut, Mahotin’s Gladiator, being led to the race-course in a blue forage horsecloth, with what looked like huge ears edged with blue"
10296,"Vronsky moved into the middle of the crowd unnoticed, almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race, and the tall, mudspattered horse-guard who came in first, bending over the saddle, let go the reins of his panting gray horse that looked dark with sweat"
10297,"he had a red nose, and an open, drunken-looking face"
10298,"Cord, in honor of the races, had put on his best clothes, a black coat buttoned up, a stiffly starched collar, which propped up his cheeks, a round black hat, and top boots"
10299,"Prince Kuzovlev sat with a white face on his thoroughbred mare from the Grabovsky stud, while an English groom led her by the bridle"
10300,"Several of the riders were in front and several behind, when suddenly Vronsky heard the sound of a horse galloping in the mud behind him, and he was overtaken by Mahotin on his white-legged, lop-eared Gladiator"
10301,"Vronsky was aware of those eyes fastened upon him from all sides, but he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare, the ground racing to meet him, and the back and white legs of Gladiator beating time swiftly before him, and keeping always the same distance ahead"
10302,"Once more he perceived in front of him the same back and short tail, and again the same swiftly moving white legs that got no further away"
10303,"He could not yet make out what had happened, when the white legs of a chestnut horse flashed by close to him, and Mahotin passed at a swift gallop"
10304,"“It’s just this,” said the doctor, taking a finger of his kid glove in his white hands and pulling it, “if you don’t strain the strings, and then try to break them, you’ll find it a difficult job;"
10305,"“It’s too early for Betsy,” she thought, and glancing out of the window she caught sight of the carriage and the black hat of Alexey Alexandrovitch, and the ears that she knew so well sticking up each side of it"
10306,"Princess Tverskaya did not get out of her carriage, but her groom, in high boots, a cape, and black hat, darted out at the entrance"
10307,Her face was white and set
10308,"Varenka, in her dark dress, in a black hat with a turn-down brim, was walking up and down the whole length of the arcade with a blind Frenchwoman, and, every time she met Kitty, they exchanged friendly glances"
10309,"Then she recalled the thin, terribly thin figure of Petrov, with his long neck, in his brown coat, his scant, curly hair, his questioning blue eyes that were so terrible to Kitty at first, and his painful attempts to seem hearty and lively in her presence"
10310,"the bright, cheerful houses with their little gardens, the sight of the red-faced, red-armed, beer-drinking German waitresses, working away merrily, did the heart good"
10311,"The bright sun, the brilliant green of the foliage, the strains of the music were for her the natural setting of all these familiar faces, with their changes to greater emaciation or to convalescence, for which she watched"
10312,She was walking rapidly towards them carrying an elegant red bag
10313,"What a piteous face!” he asked, noticing a sick man of medium height sitting on a bench, wearing a brown overcoat and white trousers that fell in strange folds about his long, fleshless legs"
10314,"The painter bowed and smiled, showing his strangely dazzling white teeth"
10315,"Anita!” he said loudly, and the swollen veins stood out like cords on his thin white neck"
10316,"“Oh, here’s Madame Stahl,” said Kitty, indicating an invalid carriage, where, propped on pillows, something in gray and blue was lying under a sunshade"
10317,"In the trembling circles of shadow cast by the leaves, at a table, covered with a white cloth, and set with coffeepot, bread-and-butter, cheese, and cold game, sat the princess in a high cap with lilac ribbons, distributing cups and bread-and-butter"
10318,Why are you so red?” her mother and father said to her with one voice
10319,"when the rye is all in ear, though its ears are still light, not yet full, and it waves in gray-green billows in the wind;"
10320,"when the green oats, with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and there among it, droop irregularly over the late-sown fields;"
10321,"Sergey Ivanovitch was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods, which were a tangled mass of leaves, pointing out to his brother now an old lime tree on the point of flowering, dark on the shady side, and brightly spotted with yellow stipules, now the young shoots of this year’s saplings brilliant with emerald"
10322,"When they came out of the woods, all his attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow land on the upland, in parts yellow with grass, in parts trampled and checkered with furrows, in parts dotted with ridges of dung, and in parts even ploughed"
10323,"His brother seated himself under a bush, arranging his tackle, while Levin led the horse away, fastened him up, and walked into the vast gray-green sea of grass unstirred by the wind"
10324,"From the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below, with its grayish ridges of cut grass, and the black heaps of coats, taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting"
10325,"Here was old Yermil in a very long white smock, bending forward to swing a scythe;"
10326,"And truly Levin had never drunk any liquor so good as this warm water with green bits floating in it, and a taste of rust from the tin dipper"
10327,"After a brief consultation—whether to take the rows lengthwise or diagonally—Prohor Yermilin, also a renowned mower, a huge, black-haired peasant, went on ahead"
10328,"To the carriage, instead of the restive Raven, they had harnessed, thanks to the representations of Marya Philimonovna, the bailiff’s horse, Brownie, and Darya Alexandrovna, delayed by anxiety over her own attire, came out and got in, dressed in a white muslin gown"
10329,Your new white frock!
10330,"as white as sugar,” said one, admiring Tanitchka, and shaking her head;"
10331,"Darya Alexandrovna peeped out in front, and was delighted when she recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of Levin walking to meet them"
10332,"he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might allow me to be of use to you,” said Levin, and as he said it he became suddenly embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he walked on in silence by the wagonette, snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them"
10333,"In front of him, in the bend of the river beyond the marsh, moved a bright-colored line of peasant women, and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green stubble"
10334,"After the women came the men with pitchforks, and from the gray rows there were growing up broad, high, soft haycocks"
10335,"First she gathered it together, stuck the fork into it, then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it, and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up, and arching her full bosom under the white smock, with a smart turn swung the fork in her arms, and flung the bundle of hay high onto the cart"
10336,"As she raked together what was left of the hay, the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck, and straightening the red kerchief that had dropped forward over her white brow, not browned like her face by the sun, she crept under the cart to tie up the load"
10337,"“How beautiful!” he thought, looking at the strange, as it were, mother-of-pearl shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his head in the middle of the sky"
10338,"Just now I looked at the sky, and there was nothing in it—only two white streaks"
10339,"A slight wind arose, and the sky looked gray and sullen"
10340,"In the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner, and at the window, evidently only just awake, sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap"
10341,The sky had grown blue and bright;
10342,"Insufferably insolent and challenging was the effect in Alexey Alexandrovitch’s eyes of the black lace about the head, admirably touched in by the painter, the black hair and handsome white hand with one finger lifted, covered with rings"
10343,"Alexey Alexandrovitch’s characteristic quality as a politician, that special individual qualification that every rising functionary possesses, the qualification that with his unflagging ambition, his reserve, his honesty, and with his self-confidence had made his career, was his contempt for red tape, his cutting down of correspondence, his direct contact, wherever possible, with the living fact, and his economy"
10344,"On meeting Betsy coming towards her in a white gown that struck her by its elegance, Anna smiled at her just as she always did"
10345,Sappho Shtoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes
10346,"On waking up the day after the races, Vronsky put on a white linen coat, and without shaving or taking his bath, he distributed about the table moneys, bills, and letters, and set to work"
10347,"In the courtyard the first objects that met Vronsky’s eyes were a band of singers in white linen coats, standing near a barrel of vodka, and the robust, good-humored figure of the colonel surrounded by officers"
10348,"the roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun, the sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings, the figures of passers-by, the carriages that met him now and then, the motionless green of the trees and grass, the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes, and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses, and trees, and bushes, and even from the rows of potatoes—everything was bright like a pretty landscape just finished and freshly varnished"
10349,"No one, looking at his white hands, with their swollen veins and long fingers, so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him, and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side, would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm, set the members shouting and attacking one another, and force the president to call for order"
10350,"A bald, well-preserved old man, with a broad, red beard, gray on his cheeks, opened the gate, squeezing against the gatepost to let the three horses pass"
10351,"He regarded Russia as a ruined country, rather after the style of Turkey, and the government of Russia as so bad that he never permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously, and yet he was a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility, and when he drove about he always wore the cockade of office and the cap with the red band"
10352,"This agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the sister-in-law was sitting opposite to him, in a dress, specially put on, as he fancied, for his benefit, cut particularly open, in the shape of a trapeze, on her white bosom"
10353,"His brilliant black eyes were looking straight at the excited country gentleman with gray whiskers, and apparently he derived amusement from his remarks"
10354,"The gentleman with the gray whiskers was obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist, who had lived all his life in the country"
10355,"Levin, who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods, exchanged glances with Sviazhsky and interrupted Mihail Petrovitch, turning again to the gentleman with the gray whiskers"
10356,"A great deal more of what the gentleman with the gray whiskers said to show in what way Russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very true, new to him, and quite incontestable"
10357,"“Italian bookkeeping,” said the gentleman of the gray whiskers ironically"
10358,"“That’s true enough,” the gentleman with the gray whiskers chimed in, positively laughing with satisfaction"
10359,"The gray-whiskered landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of Sviazhsky’s famling, obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making"
10360,"Having lost his antagonist, Levin continued the conversation with the gray-whiskered landowner, trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we don’t find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer;"
10361,"And its being me, Kostya Levin, who went to a ball in a black tie, and was refused by the Shtcherbatskaya girl, and who was intrinsically such a pitiful, worthless creature—that proves nothing;"
10362,"Yes, there were gray hairs about his temples"
10363,By gymnastics and careful attention to his health he had brought himself to such a point that in spite of his excess in pleasure he looked as fresh as a big glossy green Dutch cucumber
10364,In England he had galloped in a red coat over hedges and killed two hundred pheasants for a bet
10365,"In reality, of all the Russian entertainments the prince liked best French actresses and ballet dancers and white-seal champagne"
10366,"The gas jet threw its full light on the bloodless, sunken face under the black hat and on the white cravat, brilliant against the beaver of the coat"
10367,"“And I confess,” he said, with a smile, showing his thick, white teeth, “this week I’ve been, as it were, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn’t like it"
10368,"She turned away from him, pulled the hook at last out of the crochet work, and rapidly, with the help of her forefinger, began working loop after loop of the wool that was dazzling white in the lamplight, while the slender wrist moved swiftly, nervously in the embroidered cuff"
10369,"She laid her hand on his sleeve, dazzling and white with its rings in the lamplight"
10370,"“No!” he shrieked, in his shrill voice, which pitched a note higher than usual even, and his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing, he forcibly sat her down in her place"
10371,"He sat down himself, and, rubbing his little hands with short fingers covered with white hairs, he bent his head on one side"
10372,"Alexey Alexandrovitch glanced at his face, and saw that the shrewd, gray eyes were laughing, and seemed to know all about it already"
10373,"The lawyer’s gray eyes tried not to laugh, but they were dancing with irrepressible glee, and Alexey Alexandrovitch saw that it was not simply the delight of a man who has just got a profitable job:"
10374,"And on receiving an assuring nod from Alexey Alexandrovitch, he went on, stealing a glance now and then at Alexey Alexandrovitch’s face, which was growing red in patches"
10375,"At the corner of the pavement, in a short, stylish overcoat and a low-crowned fashionable hat, jauntily askew, with a smile that showed a gleam of white teeth and red lips, stood Stepan Arkadyevitch, radiant, young, and beaming"
10376,"Darya Alexandrovna, in her best gray silk gown, obviously worried about the children, who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery, and by her husband’s absence, was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him"
10377,Karenin himself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies and was wearing evening dress and a white tie
10378,"“You have killed a bear, I’ve been told!” said Kitty, trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away, and setting the lace quivering over her white arm"
10379,"The two footmen and Matvey, in white cravats, did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively, quietly, and swiftly"
10380,Will you take red wine?” said Stepan Arkadyevitch
10381,"“Vasya Pryatchnikov,” he said, with a good-natured smile on his damp, red lips, addressing himself principally to the most important guest, Alexey Alexandrovitch, “they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver, and has killed him"
10382,"His face turned red in patches, and his dim eyes looked straight before him"
10383,"Shtcherbatsky moved away from them, and Kitty, going up to a card-table, sat down, and, taking up the chalk, began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth"
10384,"He would have talked with him, and tried to comfort him, but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on, he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross, silent, but full of meaning for him, and the mounting lurid yellow star"
10385,"The sledge-driver was splendid in a white shirt-collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong, full-blooded red neck"
10386,"Her name, written in blue pencil, “Anna,” was the first thing that caught his eye"
10387,"Her cheeks were flushed crimson, her eyes glittered, her little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt, twisting it about"
10388,"First it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon, then the midwife’s white hands, then the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed"
10389,"Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom, in a braided livery and a bear fur cape, holding a white fur cloak"
10390,"Anna, in a gray dressing gown, with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head, was sitting on a settee"
10391,"Betsy, dressed in the height of the latest fashion, in a hat that towered somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp, in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt, was sitting beside Anna, her tall flat figure held erect"
10392,He remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm
10393,"When the princess came to them, they were sitting side by side on the chest, sorting the dresses and disputing over Kitty’s wanting to give Dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when Levin proposed to her, while he insisted that that dress must never be given away, but Dunyasha must have the blue one"
10394,"More carriages were continually driving up, and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains, and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into the church"
10395,"The gilt on the red ground of the holy picture-stand, and the gilt relief on the pictures, and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks, and the stones of the floor, and the rugs, and the banners above in the choir, and the steps of the altar, and the old blackened books, and the cassocks and surplices—all were flooded with light"
10396,"On the right side of the warm church, in the crowd of frock coats and white ties, uniforms and broadcloth, velvet, satin, hair and flowers, bare shoulders and arms and long gloves, there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola"
10397,"Kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready, and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing-room of the Shtcherbatskys’ house with her sister, Madame Lvova, who was her bridal-mother"
10398,"He looked at her hair done up high, with the long white veil and white flowers and the high, stand-up, scalloped collar, that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in front, her strikingly slender figure, and it seemed to him that she looked better than ever—not because these flowers, this veil, this gown from Paris added anything to her beauty;"
10399,"She did not look round, but the high scalloped collar, that reached her little pink ear, trembled faintly"
10400,"On the day when in the drawing-room of the house in Arbaty Street she had gone up to him in her brown dress, and given herself to him without a word—on that day, at that hour, there took place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life, and a quite different, new, utterly strange life had begun for her, while the old life was actually going on as before"
10401,"” And putting his big ring on Kitty’s touchingly weak, pink little finger, the priest said the same thing"
10402,"and during the ceremony of plighting troth, in the brilliantly lighted church, there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls, and men in white ties, frockcoats, and uniforms"
10403,And she had stood just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil
10404,“Is that her sister in the white satin?
10405,"When the ceremony of plighting troth was over, the beadle spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff, the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm, in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another, and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug"
10406,"They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water, and they were still more pleased when the priest, flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his, led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting “Glory to God"
10407,"A handsome head waiter, with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards, an evening coat, a broad white cambric shirt front, and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his rounded stomach, stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets, looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him"
10408,"“How glad I am to meet you!” said Vronsky, showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile"
10409,"The old neglected palazzo, with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes on the walls, with its floors of mosaic, with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows, with its vases on pedestals, and its open fireplaces, its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms, hung with pictures—this palazzo did much, by its very appearance after they had moved into it, to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a Russian country gentleman, a retired army officer, as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts, himself a modest artist who had renounced the world, his connections, and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved"
10410,"Thick-set and of middle height, with nimble movements, with his brown hat, olive-green coat and narrow trousers—though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion,—most of all, with the ordinariness of his broad face, and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity, Mihailov made an unpleasant impression"
10411,"The other, a little younger, was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows, with his tangled, flaxen head in his hands, staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes"
10412,"If he knew that I think no more of them than of Piotr the cook,” she thought, looking at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself"
10413,"She positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears, and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands, twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do"
10414,"The long white ridge of his spine, with the huge, prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae, was bare, and Marya Nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt, and could not get the long, limp arm into it"
10415,"The sick man himself, washed and combed, lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows, in a clean night-shirt with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck, and with a new expression of hope looked fixedly at Kitty"
10416,"“Dear friend!” repeated Countess Lidia Ivanovna, never taking her eyes off his, and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners, describing a triangle on her forehead, her ugly yellow face became still uglier, but Alexey Alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry for him and was preparing to cry"
10417,"That bill on blue paper, for a hat and ribbons, he could not recall without a rush of self-pity"
10418,"Analyzing her feeling, and comparing it with former passions, she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with Komissarov if he had not saved the life of the Tsar, that she would not have been in love with Ristitch-Kudzhitsky if there had been no Slavonic question, but that she loved Karenin for himself, for his lofty, uncomprehended soul, for the sweet—to her—high notes of his voice, for his drawling intonation, his weary eyes, his character, and his soft white hands with their swollen veins"
10419,"on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram, and the letter smelt of agreeable scent"
10420,"“If only Countess Marya Borissovna were Minister of War, and Princess Vatkovskaya were Commander-in-Chief,” said a gray-headed, little old man in a gold-embroidered uniform, addressing a tall, handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new appointments"
10421,"Just look at him,” said the little old man, pointing with his embroidered hat to Karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his shoulders, standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the Imperial Council"
10422,"“And how strong they all are, how sound physically,” thought Alexey Alexandrovitch, looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the bedchamber with his well-combed, perfumed whiskers, and at the red neck of the prince, pinched by his tight uniform"
10423,"Catching sight of the yellow shoulders of Lidia Ivanovna jutting out above her corset, and her fine pensive eyes bidding him to her, Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled, revealing untarnished white teeth, and went towards her"
10424,"Seryozha fell to dreaming, gazing up at the face of the porter, which he had thoroughly studied in every detail, especially the chin that hung down between the gray whiskers, never seen by anyone but Seryozha, who saw him only from below"
10425,"In it he was in a white smock, sitting astride a chair, with frowning eyes and smiling lips"
10426,"Anna was already dressed in a low-necked gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in Paris, and with costly white lace on her head, framing her face, and particularly becoming, showing up her dazzling beauty"
10427,"The conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering, and straightened his white tie"
10428,the same gaily dressed women—God knows who—and uniforms and black coats;
10429,"“Yes, it was like going back home when I put on a black coat,” answered Vronsky, smiling and slowly taking out his opera-glass"
10430,"Anna, folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet, was gazing away and did not see, and obviously did not wish to see, what was taking place in the next box"
10431,"Varenka was standing at the door, dressed in a yellow print gown, with a white kerchief on her head"
10432,"“I’ll do it,” said Dolly, and getting up, she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup"
10433,"“He does, he doesn’t,” said Levin, tearing off the white petals"
10434,"Varenka, with her white kerchief on her black hair, surrounded by the children, gaily and good-humoredly looking after them, and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for, was very attractive"
10435,"“I’m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest, or else my efforts will make no show,” he said, and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart, and went more into the heart of the wood, where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel"
10436,"Walking some forty paces away, Sergey Ivanovitch, knowing he was out of sight, stood still behind a bushy spindle-tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins"
10437,"The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus, and the light went out"
10438,"But he came of a long-lived family, he had not a single gray hair, no one would have taken him for forty, and he remembered Varenka’s saying that it was only in Russia that men of fifty thought themselves old, and that in France a man of fifty considers himself dans la force de l’âge, while a man of forty is un jeune homme"
10439,"Was it not youth to feel as he felt now, when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of Varenka in her yellow gown with her basket, walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree, and when this impression of the sight of Varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view, of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine, and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance?"
10440,"“Well, did you find some?” she asked from under the white kerchief, turning her handsome, gently smiling face to him"
10441,"Varenka got up while Masha picked the fungus, breaking it into two white halves"
10442,"“I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at the edge of the wood, though I can’t tell them apart"
10443,"Varenka’s heart throbbed so that she heard it beating, and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again"
10444,"“Look, Kitty,” he said, pointing to the moon, which had just risen behind the lime trees—“how exquisite!"
10445,"The first to come out was Vassenka Veslovsky, in new high boots that reached half-way up his thick thighs, in a green blouse, with a new Russian leather cartridge-belt, and in his Scotch cap with ribbons, with a brand-new English gun without a sling"
10446,"Kitty was distressed, as she always was, at parting for a couple of days from her husband, but when she saw his eager figure, looking big and strong in his shooting-boots and his white blouse, and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her, she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure, and said good-bye to him cheerfully"
10447,"“Now, gentlemen,” said Levin, pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression, “do you see those reeds?” He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half-mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river"
10448,"Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another, still flying low in the reeds, and together with the report of the shot, that snipe too fell, and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut, its unhurt wing showing white beneath"
10449,"“Come along, it’s all right!” shouted a good-humored-looking bearded peasant with a red face, showing his white teeth in a grin, and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight"
10450,"Krak darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder, black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh, and with the air of a conqueror sniffed at Laska"
10451,"He came to meet him, red and perspiring, with unbuttoned neckband, still limping in the same way"
10452,It was still gray out-of-doors
10453,"The pink flush of dawn, which one could not help seeing before, now had to be sought to be discerned at all"
10454,And immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire
10455,"The moon had lost all of its luster, and was like a white cloud in the sky"
10456,The blue of the grass had changed to yellow-green
10457,The smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass
10458,"What for?” she said, when they had at last reached a solitary garden seat at a turn in the lime tree avenue"
10459,"his funeral, the callous indifference of all at the little pink coffin, and her own torn heart, and her lonely anguish at the sight of the pale little brow with its projecting temples, and the open, wondering little mouth seen in the coffin at the moment when it was being covered with the little pink lid with a cross braided on it"
10460,"Anna, quietly walking her horse, a sturdy English cob with cropped mane and short tail, her beautiful head with her black hair straying loose under her high hat, her full shoulders, her slender waist in her black riding habit, and all the ease and grace of her deportment, impressed Dolly"
10461,"Beside Anna, on a hot-looking gray cavalry horse, was Vassenka Veslovsky in his Scotch cap with floating ribbons, his stout legs stretched out in front, obviously pleased with his own appearance"
10462,"Vronsky, taking off his tall gray hat, went up to Dolly"
10463,"“You wouldn’t believe how glad we are to see you,” he said, giving peculiar significance to the words, and showing his strong white teeth in a smile"
10464,"What’s this, what are all these buildings?” she asked, wanting to change the conversation and pointing to the red and green roofs that came into view behind the green hedges of acacia and lilac"
10465,"The rosy baby with her black eyebrows and hair, her sturdy red little body with tight goose-flesh skin, delighted Darya Alexandrovna in spite of the cross expression with which she stared at the stranger"
10466,"Looking round like some little wild animal at the grown-up big people with her bright black eyes, she smiled, unmistakably pleased at their admiring her, and holding her legs sideways, she pressed vigorously on her arms, and rapidly drew her whole back up after, and then made another step forward with her little arms"
10467,"After going down several turnings, and going through a little gate, Darya Alexandrovna saw standing on rising ground before her a large pretentious-looking red building, almost finished"
10468,"Darya Alexandrovna looked with timid inquiry into his energetic face, which under the lime-trees was continually being lighted up in patches by the sunshine, and then passing into complete shadow again"
10469,"Going into the drawing-room they found Princess Varvara already there, and the gentlemen of the party in black frock-coats"
10470,"A stout butler, resplendent with a smoothly shaven round chin and a starched white cravat, announced that dinner was ready, and the ladies got up"
10471,"Anna took a knife and fork in her beautiful white hands covered with rings, and began showing how the machine worked"
10472,"Like the other men of the party, with the ladies’ permission, he took off his coat, and his solid, comely figure in his white shirt-sleeves, with his red perspiring face and his impulsive movements, made a picture that imprinted itself vividly on the memory"
10473,"She moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with extraordinary rapidity, as happens during moments of excitement;"
10474,"And however white and beautiful her bare arms are, however beautiful her full figure and her eager face under her black curls, he will find something better still, just as my disgusting, pitiful, and charming husband does"
10475,In her white dressing gown her figure seemed more than usually grand and broad
10476,"The younger men wore the uniform of the nobility with long waists and broad shoulders, unbuttoned over white waistcoats, or uniforms with black collars and with the embroidered badges of justices of the peace"
10477,"He particularly liked the way one gray-whiskered waiter, who showed his scorn for the other younger ones and was jeered at by them, was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly"
10478,"Levin walked into the room, received a white ball, and followed his brother, Sergey Ivanovitch, to the table where Sviazhsky was standing with a significant and ironical face, holding his beard in his fist and sniffing at it"
10479,"His face and his whole figure in his uniform with the crosses, and white trousers striped with braid, as he moved hurriedly along, reminded Levin of some hunted beast who sees that he is in evil case"
10480,The leaders of both parties were reckoning white and black on their fingers
10481,"The speaker was a country gentleman with gray whiskers, wearing the regimental uniform of an old general staff-officer"
10482,"” He pointed to the imposing figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch in white trousers and his court uniform, walking by with a general"
10483,"‘To my thinking, I’d cut down that lime-tree"
10484,The landowner chuckled under his white mustaches
10485,"The secretary knocked, the door opened, and Levin was met by two red-faced gentlemen, who darted out"
10486,"“I can’t stand any more of it,” said one red-faced gentleman"
10487,"“Mercy on us!” and with a heavy sigh the marshal of the province walked with downcast head to the high table in the middle of the room, his legs staggering in his white trousers"
10488,"Lvov, in a house coat with a belt and in chamois leather shoes, was sitting in an armchair, and with a pince-nez with blue glasses he was reading a book that stood on a reading desk, while in his beautiful hand he held a half-burned cigarette daintily away from him"
10489,"“Well, then, I will attack him,” said Madame Lvova, with a smile, standing in her white sheepskin cape, waiting till they had finished speaking"
10490,"He tried not to let his attention be distracted, and not to spoil his impression by looking at the conductor in a white tie, waving his arms, which always disturbed his enjoyment of music so much, or the ladies in bonnets, with strings carefully tied over their ears, and all these people either thinking of nothing at all or thinking of all sorts of things except the music"
10491,"Stepan Arkadyevitch took the glass, and looking towards a bald man with red mustaches at the other end of the table, he nodded to him, smiling"
10492,"“It has been ready a long while,” answered the marker, who had already set the balls in a triangle, and was knocking the red one about for his own diversion"
10493,"But as soon as the carriage drove out into the street, and he felt it jolting over the uneven road, heard the angry shout of a sledge driver coming towards them, saw in the uncertain light the red blind of a tavern and the shops, this impression was dissipated, and he began to think over his actions, and to wonder whether he was doing right in going to see Anna"
10494,"Looking at himself in the glass, Levin noticed that he was red in the face, but he felt certain he was not drunk, and he followed Stepan Arkadyevitch up the carpeted stairs"
10495,"It was not a picture, but a living, charming woman, with black curling hair, with bare arms and shoulders, with a pensive smile on the lips, covered with soft down;"
10496,"Anna had come from behind the treillage to meet him, and Levin saw in the dim light of the study the very woman of the portrait, in a dark blue shot gown, not in the same position nor with the same expression, but with the same perfection of beauty which the artist had caught in the portrait"
10497,"and in the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand, introduced him to Vorkuev and indicated a red-haired, pretty little girl who was sitting at work, calling her her pupil, Levin recognized and liked the manners of a woman of the great world, always self-possessed and natural"
10498,"He saw the old princess too, flushed and overwrought, with her gray curls in disorder, forcing herself to gulp down her tears, biting her lips;"
10499,"Carefully set to rights, with hair well-brushed, in a smart little cap with some blue in it, her arms out on the quilt, she was lying on her back"
10500,"“Wait a minute, we’ll make him tidy first,” and Lizaveta Petrovna laid the red wobbling thing on the bed, began untrussing and trussing up the baby, lifting it up and turning it over with one finger and powdering it with something"
10501,"And Lizaveta Petrovna, with one hand supporting the wobbling head, lifted up on the other arm the strange, limp, red creature, whose head was lost in its swaddling clothes"
10502,"“I beg,” said Alexey Alexandrovitch shrilly, getting suddenly onto his feet, his face white and his jaws twitching, “I beg you to drop this"
10503,"He’s not Seryozha now, but quite full-fledged Sergey Alexyevitch!” said Stepan Arkadyevitch, smiling, as he looked at the handsome, broad-shouldered lad in blue coat and long trousers, who walked in alertly and confidently"
10504,"In Moscow he sometimes found a gray hair in his head, dropped asleep after dinner, stretched, walked slowly upstairs, breathing heavily, was bored by the society of young women, and did not dance at balls"
10505,“In an absurd red costume de natation;
10506,"Where are his blue eyes, his sweet, shy smile?” was her first thought when she saw her chubby, rosy little girl with her black, curly hair instead of Seryozha, whom in the tangle of her ideas she had expected to see in the nursery"
10507,There was unmistakable sympathy in those good-natured little gray eyes
10508,"Was that really me, with red hands?"
10509,"That fellow wants everyone to admire him and is very much pleased with himself,” she thought, looking at a red-faced clerk, riding on a riding-school horse"
10510,"” Thinking of Alexey Alexandrovitch, she at once pictured him with extraordinary vividness as though he were alive before her, with his mild, lifeless, dull eyes, the blue veins in his white hands, his intonations and the cracking of his fingers, and remembering the feeling which had existed between them, and which was also called love, she shuddered with loathing"
10511,"“Yes,” she said, handing him her purse, and taking a little red bag in her hand, she got out of the carriage"
10512,"And glancing at the red-cheeked husband and the thin wife, she saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood, and the husband deceived her and encouraged her in that idea of herself"
10513,"Just as she was talking to the porter, the coachman Mihail, red and cheerful in his smart blue coat and chain, evidently proud of having so successfully performed his commission, came up to her and gave her a letter"
10514,"but the red bag which she tried to drop out of her hand delayed her, and she was too late;"
10515,"And exactly at the moment when the space between the wheels came opposite her, she dropped the red bag, and drawing her head back into her shoulders, fell on her hands under the carriage, and lightly, as though she would rise again at once, dropped on to her knees"
10516,"“Here he is!” said the princess, indicating Vronsky, who with his mother on his arm walked by, wearing a long overcoat and wide-brimmed black hat"
10517,"Levin was not at home when Katavasov and Sergey Ivanovitch in a fly hired at the station drove up to the steps of the Pokrovskoe house, as black as Moors from the dust of the road"
10518,"“But I’m not a negro, I shall look like a human being when I wash,” said Katavasov in his jesting fashion, and he shook hands and smiled, his teeth flashing white in his black face"
10519,"“What makes you think he knows you?” she added, with a sidelong glance at the baby’s eyes, that peered roguishly, as she fancied, from under his cap, at his rhythmically puffing cheeks, and the little red-palmed hand he was waving"
10520,"Only from time to time, as he went on sucking, the baby raised his long, curly eyelashes and peeped at his mother with wet eyes, that looked black in the twilight"
10521,"but to succeed in getting through it all everyone in the village, from the old man to the young child, must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual, living on rye-beer, onions, and black bread, thrashing and carrying the sheaves at night, and not giving more than two or three hours in the twenty-four to sleep"
10522,"He gazed through the open door in which the dry bitter dust of the thrashing whirled and played, at the grass of the thrashing floor in the sunlight and the fresh straw that had been brought in from the barn, then at the speckly-headed, white-breasted swallows that flew chirping in under the roof and, fluttering their wings, settled in the crevices of the doorway, then at the peasants bustling in the dark, dusty barn, and he thought strange thoughts"
10523,"they’ll bury her, and nothing will be left either of her or of that smart girl in the red jacket, who with that skillful, soft action shakes the ears out of their husks"
10524,“And they will bury her and Fyodor the thrasher with his curly beard full of chaff and his shirt torn on his white shoulders—they will bury him
10525,"Fyodor, black with the dust that clung to his moist face, shouted something in response, but still went on doing it as Levin did not want him to"
10526,"Working on till the peasants’ dinner hour, which was not long in coming, he went out of the barn with Fyodor and fell into talk with him, stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the thrashing floor for seed"
10527,"“Yes, I must make it clear to myself and understand,” he thought, looking intently at the untrampled grass before him, and following the movements of a green beetle, advancing along a blade of couch-grass and lifting up in its progress a leaf of goat-weed"
10528,"But, however I screw up my eyes and strain my sight, I cannot see it not round and not bounded, and in spite of my knowing about infinite space, I am incontestably right when I see a solid blue dome, and more right than when I strain my eyes to see beyond it"
10529,"“Just look, Darya Alexandrovna, we shall have a shower,” he added, pointing with a sunshade at the white rain clouds that showed above the aspen tree-tops"
10530,"Going along the narrow path to a little uncut meadow covered on one side with thick clumps of brilliant heart’s-ease among which stood up here and there tall, dark green tufts of hellebore, Levin settled his guests in the dense, cool shade of the young aspens on a bench and some stumps purposely put there for visitors to the bee-house who might be afraid of the bees, and he went off himself to the hut to get bread, cucumbers, and fresh honey, to regale them with"
10531,"In front of the openings of the hives, it made his eyes giddy to watch the bees and drones whirling round and round about the same spot, while among them the working bees flew in and out with spoils or in search of them, always in the same direction into the wood to the flowering lime trees and back to the hives"
10532,He was carefully with a blunt knife getting a live bee covered with sticky honey out of a cup full of white honeycomb
10533,"The handsome old man, with black grizzled beard and thick silvery hair, stood motionless, holding a cup of honey, looking down from the height of his tall figure with friendly serenity at the gentlefolk, obviously understanding nothing of their conversation and not caring to understand it"
10534,"But the storm-clouds, turning white and then black, moved down so quickly that they had to quicken their pace to get home before the rain"
10535,"The foremost clouds, lowering and black as soot-laden smoke, rushed with extraordinary swiftness over the sky"
10536,"Stubbornly, as though insisting on its rights, the wind stopped Levin, and tearing the leaves and flowers off the lime trees and stripping the white birch branches into strange unseemly nakedness, it twisted everything on one side—acacias, flowers, burdocks, long grass, and tall tree-tops"
10537,"The streaming rain had already flung its white veil over all the distant forest and half the fields close by, and was rapidly swooping down upon the copse"
10538,"Holding his head bent down before him, and struggling with the wind that strove to tear the wraps away from him, Levin was moving up to the copse and had just caught sight of something white behind the oak tree, when there was a sudden flash, the whole earth seemed on fire, and the vault of heaven seemed crashing overhead"
10539,"Opening his blinded eyes, Levin gazed through the thick veil of rain that separated him now from the copse, and to his horror the first thing he saw was the green crest of the familiar oak-tree in the middle of the copse uncannily changing its position"
10540,They were at the other end of the copse under an old lime-tree;
10541,Both stood bending over a perambulator with a green umbrella
10542,"besides, the storm clouds still hung about the horizon, and gathered here and there, black and thundery, on the rim of the sky"
10543,"Levin listened to the monotonous drip from the lime trees in the garden, and looked at the triangle of stars he knew so well, and the Milky Way with its branches that ran through its midst"
10544,"The square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on Bitzer, perhaps because he chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which, darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room, irradiated Sissy"
10545,"The first object with which they had an association, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board with a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it"
10546,"Both rose, red and disconcerted"
10547,"Mrs. Gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle of shawls, of surpassing feebleness, mental and bodily;"
10548,"It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it;"
10549,"but as matters stood, it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage"
10550,"It had a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness"
10551,"If the members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there—as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done—they made it a pious warehouse of red brick, with sometimes (but this is only in highly ornamental examples) a bell in a birdcage on the top of it"
10552,"All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe characters of black and white"
10553,"She stopped, at twilight, at the door of a mean little public-house, with dim red lights in it"
10554,"Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar, was another Pegasus—a theatrical one—with real gauze let in for his wings, golden stars stuck on all over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk"
10555,"The white night-cap, embellished with two peacock’s feathers and a pigtail bolt upright, in which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon enlivened the varied performances with his chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts, hung upon a nail;"
10556,"smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses’ provender, and sawdust;"
10557,"Made up with curls, wreaths, wings, white bismuth, and carmine, this hopeful young person soared into so pleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part of the spectators;"
10558,"And here she was now, in her elderly days, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby’s tea as he took his breakfast"
10559,"‘Indeed, Mr. Bounderby? Very thoughtful of you!’ Mrs. Sparsit’s Coriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her black eyebrows contracted as she took a sip of tea"
10560,"You were coming out of the Italian Opera, ma’am, in white satin and jewels, a blaze of splendour, when I hadn’t a penny to buy a link to light you"
10561,"‘I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire, and whitening and dying"
10562,"that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of knowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book, report, and tabular statements A to Z;"
10563,"and raising her hood a little, showed a quiet oval face, dark and rather delicate, irradiated by a pair of very gentle eyes, and further set off by the perfect order of her shining black hair"
10564,"It was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite undertaker (who turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood) kept a black ladder, in order that those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs might slide out of this working world by the windows"
10565,"It was a room, not unacquainted with the black ladder under various tenants;"
10566,"He turned from his own class and his own quarter, taking nothing but a little bread as he walked along, towards the hill on which his principal employer lived, in a red house with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps, Bounderby (in letters very like himself) upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop"
10567,"Old Stephen descended the two white steps, shutting the black door with the brazen door-plate, by the aid of the brazen full-stop, to which he gave a parting polish with the sleeve of his coat, observing that his hot hand clouded it"
10568,"They were now in the black by-road near the place, and the Hands were crowding in"
10569,"the factories, looming heavy in the black wet night—their tall chimneys rising up into the air like competing Towers of Babel"
10570,"A candle faintly burned in the window, to which the black ladder had often been raised for the sliding away of all that was most precious in this world to a striving wife and a brood of hungry babies;"
10571,’Tis thou who art in need of rest—so white and tired
10572,"Stephen looked at her, saw how pale she was, noted the disorder of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her forehead, and felt assured that his senses of sight and hearing had been awake"
10573,"Although Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard, his room was quite a blue chamber in its abundance of blue books"
10574,The distant smoke very black and heavy
10575,"In yielding up my trust here, I shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence:’ she might have said the sweetbread, for that delicate article in a savoury brown sauce was her favourite supper:"
10576,"She had that tenderness for his melancholy fate, that his great red countenance used to break out into cold perspirations when she looked at him"
10577,"Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye, some Coketown boys who were at large—a rare sight there—rowed a crazy boat, which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells"
10578,"It was another red brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and a brazen door-handle full stop"
10579,Will you allow me to ask you if it’s always as black as this?’
10580,"Walking through this extraordinarily black town, while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel, I asked a fellow whom I met; one of the working people;"
10581,"Not until the light porter announced that her nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself from her reverie, and convey her dense black eyebrows—by that time creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs"
10582,He coached himself up with a blue-book or two;
10583,"and Mr. Bounderby piloted the new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him, to the private red brick dwelling, with the black outside shutters, the green inside blinds, and the black street door up the two white steps"
10584,"and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet use of his blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a considerable accession of boredom"
10585,"Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby"
10586,"Let thousands upon thousands alone, aw leading the like lives and aw faw’en into the like muddle, and they will be as one, and yo will be as anoother, wi’ a black unpassable world betwixt yo, just as long or short a time as sich-like misery can last"
10587,"‘Just stop a moment,’ said Mr. Bounderby, excessively red in the face"
10588,by the red brick streets;
10589,"by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens were sprinkled with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers;"
10590,"Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds, about fifteen miles from the town, and accessible within a mile or two, by a railway striding on many arches over a wild country, undermined by deserted coal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary engines at pits’ mouths"
10591,"While Nickits (as a man came into my office, and told me yesterday), Nickits, who used to act in Latin, in the Westminster School plays, with the chief-justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were black in the face, is drivelling at this minute—drivelling, sir!—in a fifth floor, up a narrow dark back street in Antwerp"
10592,"She flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red when she replied in a fainter voice, ‘I do not think that likely, either"
10593,"‘For God’s sake,’ replied Tom, suddenly, ‘don’t talk about bankers!’ And very white he looked, in contrast with the roses"
10594,"then, whether he take to the serving out of red tape, or to the kindling of red fire, he is the very Devil"
10595,"Mr. Bounderby, red and hot, planted himself in the centre of the path before the horse’s head, to explode his bombshell with more effect"
10596,"she kept her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of compunction, all absorbed in interest"
10597,"always verging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom"
10598,"An overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its drooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her carriage, pass down the wooden steps of the little station into a stony road, cross it into a green lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches"
10599,"Mrs. Sparsit’s white stockings were of many colours, green predominating;"
10600,"She went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad"
10601,"Fire and steam, and smoke, and red light;"
10602,"The black eyes kept upon the railroad-carriage in which she had travelled, settled upon it a moment too late"
10603,So I do that white chap;
10604,"With his very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he pent up his indignation, however, and said:"
10605,he had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet;
10606,"As he leaned upon his hand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over to him, and sat close at his side"
10607,"He was greatly excited, horribly fevered, bit his nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard rattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up"
10608,"Her gentle hand adjusted Rachael’s shawl upon her shining black hair in the usual manner of her wearing it, and they went out"
10609,"Louisa had never spoken of harbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion with the robbery, she and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject, save in that one interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on his hand;"
10610,"Though the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal, it was green elsewhere, and there were trees to see, and there were larks singing (though it was Sunday), and there were pleasant scents in the air, and all was over-arched by a bright blue sky"
10611,"In the distance one way, Coketown showed as a black mist;"
10612,"Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass"
10613,"and the red light in the evening sky touched every face there, and caused it to be distinctly seen in all its rapt suspense"
10614,"and so, with his gray head drooping, went away"
10615,"The Emperor of Japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled with black spots, was twirling five wash-hand basins at once, as it is the favourite recreation of that monarch to do"
10616,"If you wath to thee our Children in the Wood, with their father and mother both a dyin’ on a horthe—their uncle a retheiving of ’em ath hith wardth, upon a horthe—themthelvth both a goin’ a black-berryin’ on a horthe—and the Robinth a coming in to cover ’em with leavth, upon a horthe—you’d thay it wath the completetht thing ath ever you thet your eyeth on! And you remember Emma Gordon, my dear, ath wath a’motht a mother to you? Of courthe you do;"
10617,"Amazing creatures they were in Louisa’s eyes, so white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress, and so demonstrative of leg;"
10618,"there’th two comic black thervanth twithe ath big ath the houthe, to thtand by it and to bring it in and clear it;"
10619,Your brother ith one them black thervanth
10620,"with seams in his black face, where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition daubed all over it;"
10621,"his hands, with the black partly worn away inside, looking like the hands of a monkey"
10622,"Mr. Sleary rapidly brought beer, and washed him white again"
10623,"For, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his thin lips parted, his thin nostrils distended, his white eyelashes quivering, his colourless face more colourless than ever, as if he ran himself into a white heat, when other people ran themselves into a glow"
10624,Mr. Gradgrind’s face as white as the pursuer’s
10625,"Mr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed:"
10626,"How much of futurity did he see? Did he see himself, a white-haired decrepit man, bending his hitherto inflexible theories to appointed circumstances;"
10627,"Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn gray and cold"
10628,"His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew"
10629,"She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam;"
10630,"As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness"
10631,"ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers;"
10632,"He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance"
10633,"Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation"
10634,"A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horses tail"
10635,"The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet"
10636,"and the golden-winged woodpecker with his crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage;"
10637,"and the cedar bird, with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little monteiro cap of feathers;"
10638,"and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his gay light blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering, nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove"
10639,"and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies;"
10640,"The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain"
10641,"The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the mid-heaven"
10642,"A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth to the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides"
10643,"Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles"
10644,"Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation"
10645,"Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white;"
10646,"The musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century"
10647,"who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear"
10648,"There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge"
10649,"A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson"
10650,"Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge;"
10651,"he paused and ceased whistling but, on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare"
10652,"He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame"
10653,and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church
10654,” Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him;
10655,"It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash,—he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind"
10656,"the mourners did not go about the streets indeed, for nobody put on black or made a formal dress of mourning for their nearest friends;"
10657,"and I said, indeed, that I could see nothing but a white cloud, bright on one side by the shining of the sun upon the other part"
10658,"and this folly presently made the town swarm with a wicked generation of pretenders to magic, to the black art, as they called it, and I know not what;"
10659,"And if but a grave fellow in a velvet jacket, a band, and a black coat, which was the habit those quack-conjurers generally went in, was but seen in the streets the people would follow them in crowds, and ask them questions as they went along"
10660,"‘That every house visited be marked with a red cross of a foot long in the middle of the door, evident to be seen, and with these usual printed words, that is to say, “Lord, have mercy upon us,” to be set close over the same cross, there to continue until lawful opening of the same house"
10661,"‘That precise order to be taken that the searchers, chirurgeons, keepers, and buriers are not to pass the streets without holding a red rod or wand of three feet in length in their hands, open and evident to be seen, and are not to go into any other house than into their own, or into that whereunto they are directed or sent for;"
10662,"It seems, the night before, the dead-cart, as it was called, had been stopped there, and a servant-maid had been brought down to the door dead, and the buriers or bearers, as they were called, put her into the cart, wrapt only in a green rug, and carried her away"
10663,"so the door was marked with a red cross, a padlock on the outside, as above, and a watchman set to keep the door, according to public order"
10664,"but when they came up to the pit they saw a man go to and again, muffled up in a brown Cloak, and making motions with his hands under his cloak, as if he was in great agony, and the buriers immediately gathered about him, supposing he was one of those poor delirious or desperate creatures that used to pretend, as I have said, to bury themselves"
10665,"he had on his breeches or drawers, and a yellow flannel waistcoat, no stockings, a pair of slipped-shoes, a white cap on his head, and, as the young man said, ‘death in his face’"
10666,"The great street I lived in (which is known to be one of the broadest of all the streets of London, I mean of the suburbs as well as the liberties) all the side where the butchers lived, especially without the bars, was more like a green field than a paved street, and the people generally went in the middle with the horses and carts"
10667,"After this he goes in a third time and fetches out a pair of tongs red hot, and which he had prepared, I suppose, on purpose;"
10668,"The minister of a parish not far off, not knowing of the other, sent them also about two bushels of wheat and half a bushel of white peas"
10669,"that is to say, he set the great red cross upon his door with the words, ‘Lord have mercy upon us’, and so deluded the examiner, who supposed it had been done by the constable by order of the other examiner, for there were two examiners to every district or precinct"
10670,"It is here, however, to be observed that after the funerals became so many that people could not toll the bell, mourn or weep, or wear black for one another, as they did before;"
10671,"() The upper end of Hand Alley, in Bishopsgate Street, which was then a green field, and was taken in particularly for Bishopsgate parish, though many of the carts out of the city brought their dead thither also, particularly out of the parish of St All-hallows on the Wall"
10672,"indeed we were no more afraid now to pass by a man with a white cap upon his head, or with a cloth wrapt round his neck, or with his leg limping, occasioned by the sores in his groin, all which were frightful to the last degree, but the week before"
