the army corps was about to arrive, practically as a whole unit, in south africa; but it was evident that the exigencies of the situation, and the widely divided areas of invasion, would at least defer the execution of the plan which had been formed for an invasion of the orange free state from cape colony.
lord roberts's plan was first to concentrate to his left, taking every measure to induce the boers to believe that the original scheme of invasion by the centre would now be resumed, and in this purpose he succeeded so well that his field army with the necessary transport for a cross-country march was assembled between the orange and the modder without serious mishap. cronje at the new centre of gravity was not reinforced, all available boers drawing down towards colesberg.

but this " critical value " of the force is found to depend in an unexpected manner upon the hardness of the steel; the critical value diminishes as the hardness becomes greater up to a certain point, corresponding to a yellow temper, after which it increases and with the hardest steel becomes very high.
for steel which has been made redhot, suddenly cooled, and then let down to a yellow temper, the critical value of the magnetizing force is smaller than for steel which is either softer or harder; it is indeed so small that the metal contracts like nickel even under weak magnetizing forces, without undergoing any preliminary extension that can be detected.

in 1789 klaproth isolated from pitchblende a yellow oxide which he viewed as the oxide of a new metal, which he named uranium, after the newly discovered planet of herschel.
berzelius about 1823 found that the yellow oxide, when treated with excess of sulphuric acid, gave a sulphate not unlike the ferric salt.
he concluded that the uranium salt was ur 2033s0 3, where ur 2 0 3, according to his analysis, represents 864 parts of yellow oxide (0 = 16).
like fe 2 0 3, the yellow oxide lost 48 parts of oxygen per ur203 (= 864 parts) as water, while ur 2 = 816 parts of metal remained.
peligot's results, though called in question by berzelius, have been amply confirmed by all subsequent investigators; only now, on theoretical grounds, first set forth by mendeleeff, we double peligot's atomic weight, so that u now signifies 240 parts of uranium, while uo 3 stands as the formula of the yellow oxide, and uo 2 as that of berzelius's metal.
the precipitate, after having been collected and washed, is digested with a warm concentrated solution of ammonium carbonate, which dissolves the uranium as a yellow solution of ammonium uranate, while the hydrated oxide of iron, the alumina, &c., remain.

in february 1831 these provinces rose, raised the red, white and green tricolor (which henceforth took the place of the carbonarist colors as the italian flag), and shook off the papal yoke with surprising ease.1 at parma too there was an outbreak and a demand for the constitution; marie louise could not grant it because of her engagements with austria, and, therefore, abandoned her dominions.
actuated by rancour against crispi, he, on the 29th of april 1896, authorized i the publication of a green book on abyssinian affairs, in which, without the consent of great britain, the confidential angloitalian negotiations in regard to the abyssinian war were disclosed.

the true balsam poplar, or tacamahac, p. balsamifera, abundant in most parts of canada and the northern states, is a tree of rather large growth, often of somewhat fastigiate habit, with round shoots and oblong-ovate sharp-pointed leaves, the base never cordate, the petioles round, and the disk deep glossy green above but somewhat downy below.
its fragrant shoots and the fine yellow green of the young leaves recommend it to the ornamental planter.
the molybdates may be recognized by the fact that they give a white precipitate on the addition of hydrochloric or nitric acids to their solutions, and that with reducing agents (zinc and sulphuric acid) they give generally a blue coloration which turns to a green and finally to a brown colour.
the algal fungi, phycomycetes, are obviously derived from the green algae, while the remaining fungi, the eumycetes, appear to have sprung from the same stock as the rhodophyceae.

con.) green assimilating cortical branches, which are the ends of branches from the medulla and fit tightly together, forming the continuous surface of the plant.
in the algae such a cell consists essentially of:  a mass of protoplasm provided with  a nucleus and  an assimilating apparatus consisting of a colored protoplasmic body, called a chromatophore, the pigment of which in the pure green forms is chlorophyll, and which may then be called a cliloroplast.
it is from such a living and assimilating cell, performing as it does all the vital functions of a green plant, that, according to current theory, all the different cell-forms of a higher plant have been differentiated in the course of descent.
among the green algae the differentiation of cells is comparatively slight.
the thallus in all cases consists of a branched filament of cells placed end to end, as in many of the green algae.
many of the lower forms of brown seaweeds (phoeophyceae) have a thallus consisting of simple or branched cell threads, as in the green and red forms. the lateral union of the branches to form a solid thallus is not, however, so common, nor is it carried to so high a pitch of elaboration as in the rhodophyceae.
the simpler fungi, like the simpler green algae, consist of single cells or simple or branched cell-threads, but among the higher kinds a massive body is often formed, particutissue t~jf larly in con nexion with the formation of spores, and, er~n,~,onthis may exhibit considerable tissue-differentiation.
similar modes of growth occur among the siphoneous green algae and also among the red seaweeds.
of the thallus, whatever its external form, by branched, continuous or septate, coenocytic tubes (siphoneae and fungi), or by simple or branched cell-threads (red and many green algae), in both cases growing mainly or entirely at the apex of each branch, is almost universal in.
oedocladium among the green algae).
the latter are plates of green tissue one cell thick, while the stem consists of uniform more or less elongated cylindrical cells.
the root differs from the shoot in the characters of its surface tissues, in the absence of the green assimilative pigment chlorophyll, in the arrangement of its vascular system and in the mode of growth at the apex, all features which are in direct relation to its normally subterranean life and its fixative and absorptive functions.
in all green plants which have a special protective epidermis, the cortex of the shoot has to perform the primitive fundamental function of carbon assimilation.
the cortex of a young stem is usually green, and plays a more or less important part in the assimilative function.
it does not at first appear to be the same with the bulkier plants, such as the ordinary green herbs, shrubs or trees, but a study of their earlier development indicates that they do not at the outset differ in any way from the simple undifferentiated forms. each commences its existence as a simple naked protoplast, in the embroyo-sac or the archegonium, as the case may be.
we have the formation of numerous mechanisms which have arisen in connection with the question of food supply, which may not only involve particular cells, but also lead to differentiation in the protoplasm of those cells, as in the development of the chloroplastids of the leaves and other green parts.
brown and escombe have shown that the amount of solar energy taken up by a green leaf may often be fifty times as much as it can utilize in the constructive processes of which it is the seat.
it consists essentially of a number of minute corpuscles or plastids, the protoplasmic substance of which is impregnated with a green coloring matter.
each is a small protoplasmic body, in the meshes of whose vubstance the green coloring matter chlorophyll is contained in some form of solution.
if not, there must exist in the green plant, side by side with it, another mechanism which is concerned with the manufacture of the complex compounds in which nitrogen is present.
the probability is that this mechanism is to be found in green plants in the leavesat any rate there is a certain body of evidence pointing in this direction.
the green plant prefers as a rule nitrates of various metals, such as calcium, magnesium or potassium.
the normal green plant is seen thus to be in possession of a complete machinery for the manufacture of its own food.
the power of green plants, not even specialized in any of these directions, to absorb certain carbohydrates, particularly sugars, from the soil was demonstrated by acton in 1889.
bonnier has drawn attention to the fact that the mistletoe in its turn, remaining green in the winter, contributes food material to its host when the latter has lost its leaves.
mycorhizas.the most interesting cases, however, in which fungi form symbiotic relationships with green plants have been discovered in connection with forest trees.
each species of green plant may form a mycorhiza with two or three different fungi, and a single species of fungus may enter into symbiosis with several green plants.
these are: (i) that the green plant is so stimulated by the symbiotic association which leads to the hypertrophy, that it is able to fix the nitrogen or cause it to enter into combination.
that the fixation of the gas is carried out by the fungal organism either in the soil or in the plant, and the nitrogenous substance so produced is absorbed by the organism, which is in turn consumed by the green plant.
whichever opinion is held on this point, there seems no room for doubt that the fixation of the nitrogen is concerned only with the root, and that the green leavec take no part in it.
this coloring matter, as shown by its absorption spectrum, picks out of the ordinary beam of light a large proportion of its red and blue rays, together with some of the green and yellow.

the principal symptom may show itself in general pallor, including all cases where the normal healthy green hue is replaced by a sickly yellowish hue indicating that the chlorophyll apparatus is deficient.
the chloroplasts are generally distinguished by their green color, which is due to the presence of chlorophyll; but in many algae this is masked by another coloring matterph ycoerytlsrin in the florideae, phycophaein in the phaeophyceae, and phycocyanin in the cyanophyceae.
these substances can, however, be dissolved out in water, and the green coloring matter of the chloroplast then becomes visible.
green, the soluble ferments).
the eggcell or oosphere is a large cell containing a single large nucleus, and in the green plants the rudiments of plastids.
metamorphosis.it has already been pointed out that each kind of member of the body may present a variety of forms. for example, a stem may be a tree-trunk, or a twining stem, or a tendril, or a thorn, or a creeping rhizome, or a tuber; a leaf may be a green foliage-leaf, or a scale protecting a bud, or a tendril, or a pitcher, or a floral leaf, either sepal, petal, stamen or carpel (sporophyll); a root may be a fibrous root, or a swollen tap-root like that of the beet or the turnip. all these various forms are organs discharging some special function, and are examples of what wolff called modification, and goethe metamorphosis.

they were fed with hay during the annual inundation, and at other times tethered in meadows of green clover.
in addition to the use of several kinds of animal and other manures, green crops were sometimes ploughed in by the romans.
from the third edition of hartlib's legacie we learn that clover was cut green and given to cattle; and it appears that this practice of soiling, as it is now called, had become very common about the beginning of the 18th century, wherever clover was cultivated.
green crops, such as turnips, clover and rye grass, began to be alternated with grain crops, whence the name alternate husbandry.
nor did this increased tillage interfere with the increase of live stock, as the green crops of the alternate husbandry more than compensated for the diminished pasturage.
the great losses arising from spoilt hay crops served to stimulate experimental inquiry into the method of preserving green fodder known as ensilage, with the result that the system eventually became successfully incorporated in the ordinary routine of agricultural practice.
rye is perhaps more largely grown as a green crop to be fed off by sheep, or cut green for soiling, in the spring months.
the area withdrawn from corn-growing is not to be found under the head of what are termed " green crops."
in canada and the united states this rational employment of a leguminous crop for ploughing in green is largely resorted to for the amelioration of worn-out wheat lands and other soils, the condition of which has been lowered to an unremunerative level by the repeated growth year after year of a cereal crop. the well-known paper of lawes, gilbert and pugh (1861), " on the sources of the nitrogen of vegetation,.

thomas hill green (1836-1882), english philosopher, the most typical english representative of the school of thought called neo-kantian, or neo-hegelian, was born on the 7th of april 1836 at birkin, a village in the west riding of yorkshire, of which his father was rector.
these works were not published until after his death, but green's views were previously known indirectly through the introduction to the standard edition of hume's works by green and t.
green was thus driven, not theoretically, but as a practical necessity, to raise again the whole question of man in relation to nature.
carrying on the same analytical method into the special department of moral philosophy, green held that ethics applies to the peculiar conditions of social life that investigation into man's nature which metaphysics began.
green's teaching was, directly and indirectly, the most potent philosophical influence in england during the last quarter of the 19th century, while his enthusiasm for a common citizenship, and his personal example in practical municipal life, inspired much of the effort made, in the years succeeding his death, to bring the universities more into touch with the people, and to break down the rigour of class distinctions.
nevertheless, green's statement of his conclusions presents important difficulties.

it is a matter of common observation that the blue of the sky is highly variable.

ordinary observation of the landscape shows that there is another part, highly variable from day to day, and due to suspended matter, much of which is fine enough to scatter light of blue quality.

ultramarine, a blue pigment, consisting essentially of a double silicate of aluminium and sodium with some sulphides or sulphates, and occurring in nature as a proximate component of lapis lazuli.
as early at least as the ith century the art of extracting a blue pigment from lapis lazuli was practised, and from the beginning of the 16th century this pigment began to be imported into europe from "over the sea," as azurrum ultramarinum.
in 1814 tassaert observed the spontaneous formation of a blue compound, very similar to ultramarine, if not identical with it, in a soda-furnace at st gobain, which caused the societe pour l'encouragement d'industrie to offer, in 1824, a prize for the artificial production of the precious colour.

in other respects the hirado factories do not produce wares nearly so beautiful as those manufactured there between 1759 and 1840, when the hirado-yakz stood at the head of all japanese porcelain on account of its pure, close-grained pate, its lustrous milk-white glaze, and the soft clear blue of its carefully executed decoration.
at the industrial exhibition in rioto ware ~, (1895) the first results of their efforts were shown, owari attracting attention at once, in medieval times owari was celebrated for faience glazes of various colors, much affected by the tea-clubs, but its staple manufacture from the beginning of the 19th century was porcelain decorated with blue under the glaze, the best specimens of which did not approach their chinese prototypes in fineness of pdte, purity of glaze or richness of color.
their great aim seems to be the production of the exquisite chinese monochromes known as u-kwo-tien-tsing (blue of the sky after rain) and yueh-peh (clair-detune).

blue mud, according to murray and renard, is usually of a blue or slaty or grey-green colour when fresh, the upper surface having, however, a reddish tint.
the blue colouring substance is ferrous sulphide, the upper reddish layer contains more ferric oxide, which the predominance of decomposing organic matter in the substance of the mud reduces to ferrous oxide and subsequently by further action to sulphide.
blue mud prevails in large areas of the pacific ocean from the galapagos islands to acapulco.
max weber states that blue mud occurs in the deep basins of the eastern part of the malay sea.
red mud may be classed as a variety of blue mud, from which it differs on account of the larger proportion of ochreous substance and the absence of sufficient organic matter to reduce the whole of the ferric oxide.
green mud differs to a greater extent from the blue mud, and owes its characteristic nature and colour to the presence of glauconite, which is formed inside the cases of foraminifera, the spines of echini and the spicules of sponges in a manner not yet understood.
when the proportion of calcium carbonate in the blue mud is considerable there results a calcareous ooze, which when found on the continental slope and in enclosed seas is largely composed of remains of deep-sea corals and bottom-living foraminif era, pelagic organisms including pteropods being less frequently represented.
the bottom of the black sea is covered by a stiff blue mud in which sir john murray found much sulphide of iron,' grains or needles of pyrites making up nearly 50% of the deposit, and there are also grains of amorphous calcium carbonate evidently precipitated from the water.
the formation of the blue mud is largely aided by the putrefaction of organic matter, and as a result the water deeper than 120 fathoms is extraordinarily deficient in dissolved oxygen and abounds in sulphuretted hydrogen, the formation of which is brought about by a special bacterium, the only form of life found at depths greater than 120 fathoms in the black sea.
the colour of ocean water far from land is an almost pure blue, and all the variations of tint towards green are the result of local disturbances, the usual cause being turbidity of some kind, and this in the high seas is almost always due to swarms of plankton.
the colour of sea-water as it is seen on board ship is most readily determined by comparison with the tints of forel's xanthometer or colour scale, which consists of a series of glass tubes fixed like the rungs of a ladder in a frame and filled with a mixture of blue and yellow liquids in varying proportions.
for this purpose the zero or pure blue is represented by a solution of i part of copper sulphate and 9 parts of ammonia in 190 parts of water.
the yellow solution is made up of i part of neutral potassium chromate in 199 parts of water, and to give the various degrees of the scale, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.,% of the yellow solution is mixed with 99, 9 8, 97, 96, &c.,% of the blue in successive tubes.
observations with the xanthometer have not hitherto been numerous, but it appears that the purest blue (o--i on forel's scale) is found in the sargasso sea, in the north atlantic and in similarly situated tropical or subtropical regions in the indian and pacific oceans.
the northern seas have an increasing tendency towards green, the irminger sea showing 5-9 forel, while in the north sea the water is usually a pure green (io-14 forel), the western mediterranean shows 5-9 forel, but the eastern is as blue as the open ocean (0-2 forel).
a pure blue colour has been observed in the cold southern region, where the " valdivia " found o-2 forel in 55° s.
between 10 and 31° e., and even the water of the north sea has been observed at times to be intensely blue.
the blue of the sea-water as observed by the forel scale has of course nothing to do with the blue appearance of any distant water surface due to the reflection of a cloudless sky.
there is a distinct relationship between colour and transparency in the ocean; the most transparent water which is the most free from plankton is always the purest blue, while an increasing turbidity is usually associated with an increasing tint of green.
the natural colour of pure sea-water is blue, and this is emphasized in deep and very clear water, which appears almost black to the eye.

there were three bedrooms but the largest one, presumably belonging to howie, was located in the rear of the house where it remained pitch black.

even the pictures on the wall were black and white photography in black frames.
there was an alarm clock on the nightstand beside the black base of a lamp.
black furniture, white carpets, black granite countertops in the kitchen, white walls and cabinets.
sunny was black and white, just like the rest of dusty's world.
a tall, toned woman who looked like she did pilates for a living stood in the hall in tight black leather pants and a tight pink t-shirt that drew attention to her large breasts.
and the fact the black god wanted her.
there was no such thing as a good black god, and jonny would be no exception.
he returned to the house to await darian, not surprised to see bianca's black and white cat darting down the stairs.
her breath caught as she saw talon leaning against a black car.
the devil's cold dark eyes flared and turned black.
you see the black clouds?
the frozen sea beneath her feet was the color of tar, the black clouds above paused mid-swirl around a pop of blue sky in the storm's center.
and still the black god walked.
"we wait," the black god replied.
talon watched the black god go.
it wasn't the black god.
"it's time," the black god said over his shoulder.
his eyes turned black, fathomless, and she knew whatever creature possessed the human body was loosening its grip on its powers.
the world dumped her on top of a pile of sand near the boardwalk with the angry black sea roaring behind her.
his eyes were closer to normal, swirling black spheres.
he took in the various scenes, to include the local news, which blasted photos of the black skies and mounting waves of the tropical-storm-turned-hurricane.
the black god's there?
the black god held out his hands.
he'd been jogging for an hour when a black tahoe pulled up alongside him.
dusty glanced up at the sky, where the clouds had gone from black to slate.
the black god turned at his approach.
jonny's brown eyes, now black, traveled past dusty to damian.
he said there's a new black god.
his hair was long and black, braided down his back.
jule sat with his back against the far wall, his lip bloodied, one eye black, and his hands chained above his head to the pipes running from the floor to the ceiling.
the new black god?
the gangly youth before him had dyed his hair from platinum back to its natural color of black.
the black god's gaze turned sharp.
"then what do you want?" the black god asked.
the black god wasn't able to take his eyes off her.

a blur of black shot between her and the attacker.
the black god nodded.
"her brother's the black god," darian said out of nowhere.
i can do things damian and the black god can't.
only two forms and a body draped in black remained on the cliff side.
he was tightly wrapped in black fabric, his head towards the ocean.
one of her eyes was black from a blow, and the sight infuriated him.
he was dressed in black, and his chiseled features and striking blue eyes were perfect enough to have been sculptured.
he changed into all black and strapped a sword to his back before closing his eyes and envisioning the interior of nova sector.
unlike the others dressed for a white tie event, he was dressed in leather pants with a tight black pearl jam t-shirt, his hair braided, a chain from his spiked belt to his wallet, and heavy black boots.
he opened the windows, which did little to shed light into the stone room with its masculine, black décor.
even now, her heart quickened and her thoughts raced to the image of him in tight black clothing.
damian had a lot of cars, and she found the black bmw whose lights flashed when she clicked the key fob.
damian pulled off his sweater to reveal a black t-shirt and tucked weapons into his cargo pants, boots, and pockets.
she stayed the urge to curl up in her chair, jumping when a shadow with lopsided shoulders emerged from the corner dressed like an executioner in black hood and gloves.
if she closed her eyes, she would see the black memories crossing through his mind, but she allowed him his privacy.
he was dressed again all in black, a color that should have minimized his size but just amplified how ripped he was beneath the clothing.
he sensed the visions in her head, not surprised to see his own black memories playing on the screens on the back of her eyelids along with a dark nightmare of a man in a corner crying.
it wrenched open, and a man in a black trench coat damian's size looked her over once.
shadows chased her up the stairs and flew down the halls, coating the floors and walls in shallow, black fog.
he drew away from her, and she met his black gaze.
pierre was beyond handsome with his brooding looks, wind-swept blond hair, black clothing, and trench coat.
black isn't supposed to do that.
as he pulled on the last of his clothes and crossed to his armory, a small, black velvet box nestled between two daggers drew his attention.
several cars were on fire, and black smoke spiraled toward the sky.
deep holes in the ground, rimmed with black, pockmarked the shallow valley.
the large man in black with lopsided shoulders and an executioner's hood pressed himself into a corner.
though she wasn't hungry, she drank, exploring the black curtain shielding his memories as she did.
"as soon as he's done, we'll start working on you," the black god promised.
"i've been right here!" she said, shoving at him and his black memories.
the black god looked from her towards the direction of the voice.
"two, bring her," the infuriated black god ordered.
she sobbed, absorbing the black visions spilling through his mind.
pierre gripped each of their arms and led them toward two black tahoes.
he understood that the black god can never truly kill the white god for fear of unleashing the original beings, who would crush him.
damian closed his eyes in pain, unable to shake his brother's black history.
the black god doesn't share our view.
a look around her bedchamber with its black, stone walls, ceiling and floor revealed nothing remotely edible.
her room was made of black stone and quiet with no sounds except the crackle of fire.
made of material softer than silk, the black dress she wore pooled at the top of her feet.
deidre continued through the halls lined with torches bearing black flames.
it was hunched over a book large enough to cover half the black stone desk at which it sat.
a small hourglass with black sand was in his palm.
unable to exit the dream fully, deidre had no concept of how long they stood before the black flames of the fire.
fevered and shivering, she felt too weak and hungry to focus well, but the shape of the black hourglass was unmistakable.
she had two markings on her back: one burgundy, the familiar immortal mating tattoo, and the new one black, positioned directly beneath the original.
have you ever seen the web of a black widow?
in truth, destiny is like the web of a black widow.
his black eyes saw through her; his cold features were expressionless.
the landing overlooked the parched desert surrounding the black fortress.
his black eyes scoured her features and lingered on her lips.
a black cave yawned open before her.
the air was hot and dry, the two suns too dim to shed much light into the black fortress.
death was a dark, towering, muscular figure in the living area of her apartment, clothed in black and wearing an expression that mirrored what she felt.
she gave him another smile and turned away, retreating through the black portal.
he wore black pants that hugged his lower body to reveal the lean hips and long, muscular legs.
a flare of interest was in darkyn's black gaze, one that made her realize he wasn't leaving until he was finished with her.
the light of the black fire was too dim for her to see much more than the outline of his form.
it dissipated into black smoke in his hands.
except that, on his body, it was her name written in black.
she possessed a head of coal black hair, tied in a single braid that extended below her waist, dark eyes, and a smile that lit up the room.
he couldn't imagine any childhood taunting that would have caused him to crawl into the earth through a cold, wet, and black hole.
the timing was propitious, as black clouds had begun to roll up the valley and gather above them, the advance guard of a summer shower.
thunder tumbled down the san juan mountains, heralding the arrival of pelting rain that turned the jeep road into a surging stream and the sky to an ominous shade of raven black.
that would be a hoot, pushing my cart in a black cape!
dean bumped into pumpkin green, who was leaving, a black cape and tuxedo over his arm.
pumpkin held up the hanger, his outfit draped like black robed judge.
i'm leaving my black hose at home.
the attorney quickly recovered and half slid, half ran down the slope next to his jeep where they were standing, covering his shiny black shoes with dust in the process and nearly falling on the seat of his creased shorts.
she glanced down at the black abyss before them.
her trousers were black with mud front and back, her pant leg torn, and her left knee bloody.
beneath folded boxer shorts, but not well hidden, rested a black revolver.
dean ordered a cup of black kona.
when dean arrived in the hall, he was met by two men in black and his political opponent, seymour fitzgerald.
fat man in black stifled a laugh while the acting sheriff glowered.
he was a big black guy—that was the only description.
the black man, the passenger spotted in the stolen buick, had been apprehended when he returned to the vehicle to retrieve his overnight satchel.
his black eyes saw through wynn.
just under seven feet tall and muscular, he wore all black with weapons strapped to various parts of his body.
the portal to his underworld was grey; only yellow mortal portals and the black one to hell were visible.
she pushed at the black wall again, wanting to remember.
he was like a massive shadow among the sunny forest, dressed all in black and armed as if for battle, even when coming to see her.
a head taller than her, he was lean and calm, his black eyes missing nothing.
i remembered how you acted when you saw me in the black underwear.
yeah, that was probably said by someone who didn't have a big sow black bear after them.
the man standing in the weedy area of the lot was tall and thick, dressed in a trench coat, black clothing and heavy boots.
the eyes that once turned from black to white to every color in between were now blue-green in color, and her face held a human flush enhanced by his lovemaking.
his eyes were white then black then changed from every color in between, his brown hair of medium length and wavy, ruffled by the sea breeze.
they carried weapons, too, and their eyes were pure black, their teeth pointed like jared's.
the flutter of a black trench coat blended with the dark sky as gabriel twisted them in midair, so he'd hit back first, with her protected in his arms.
there were no trench coats outside of the underworld he'd consider wearing, but he pulled on a soft black t-shirt and strapped a few sheaths to his body.
tall and lean, with eyes as black as gabriel's, the man who stood too close for her comfort wore normal enough clothing, aside from the knives strapped to his thighs.
his eye was black, one of his cheekbones yellow.
as she watched, the black eye and bruised cheek healed themselves.
dressed in black, he was an imposing figure, even in the cavernous room.
dressed all in black with weapons strapped in places identical to where gabriel wore his, the tall man was lean with cold eyes.
the muscular frame, black gaze, dark clothes all looked the same.
she stood on a covered landing of a fortress made of black stones overlooking a parched desert beneath dual suns too faded to provide anything other than indirect light.
it was dim inside the stronghold, and the first torch they crossed that burned with black flames mesmerized her long enough for her to lose sight of darkyn around a corner.
he led her past closed doors and through hallways carved out of black stone.
one opened it for him, and she trailed him into a large bedchamber complete with a hearth burning black flames.
it was muted black, made out of material smoother than silk that draped over her arm like a second skin.
she changed out of her familiar clothing into the dress that matched the black world around her.
deidre opened her eyes and blinked rapidly, realizing the black she tried to clear from her sight was the black ceiling of the operating room.
the walls, however, were as black as the ceiling.
she wore the black dress still.
the only difference was her hair and the eyes that turned from white to black to every color in between.
she sat in a chair by the black hearth.
it gave off heat despite the black flames.
she was beautiful, a woman of sunshine, smiles, and eyes that changed from white to black and every color in between.
death held out her hand, and an hourglass with black sand appeared in her palm.
she tipped the hourglass, and black sand began to spill.
he went to the only portal that glowed black --the portal to hell --and stepped from the shadow world into the tiny, dark cell holding his friend.
when she felt ready to snap, the black lady returned with the little boy in tow.
the black lady's tone left no imagination to what she thought of the latest deadbeat mom in her office.
he was tall and clothed in all black, ominous and large against the slate sky.
the man in black approached.
she stepped back even more and clenched the purse to her body, distracted as a sleek black car pulled up to the curb.
she took one more look at the ominous man in black and the sword at his hip and followed, shaking from more than cold.
katie instinctively believed her and twisted, staring with toby at the man in black who watched them drive away.
she felt the cold, black glare and fought the urge to run back inside the clinic.
he was in black, unaffected by the cold or the light settling over him, outlining him like glitter on black construction paper.
toby had drawn him on black construction paper with silver glitter outlining the shape of a man.
her mind cleared, and she wiped her eyes at the massive form in black before her.
he was close to seven feet tall, with chiseled features and eyes as black as eternity.
his eyes glowed darker than night, two black holes in his otherwise indistinguishable face.
he was muscular and tall, clothed in dark jeans, a snug grey t-shirt that hugged his biceps and stretched across his chest and back and then sagged at his slender torso and hips, and a round black medallion that fell from his t-shirt as he leaned over her.
he shook the hand of his brother and friend, whose black skin clashed with his.
it was three months' salary, though hannah had added it to the black amex her fiancé paid in full every month without a second thought.
andre's apartment was black and fiery.
his eyes were black and empty, his frame small and wiry.
her air supply cut off, she tore at the hand holding her until the skin on his arm fell away to reveal smooth, black skin more akin to a reptile's than a human's.
he made his way through the castle with the black stones as he had many times during his long stay.
sasha was waiting for him in his study, sitting beside a fireplace that burned with black flames.
his gaze took in sasha before sliding to the black flames.
she followed, startled, only to see a massive black bird the size of a pterodactyl coasting along the tops of the waves.
katie faced him and saw that he was dressed like gabriel, all in black.
she sat on the river bank across from a series of wide, large steps leading up a hill to the park where the arch stood, framed against a black sky.
the only brother not to declare outright war on him, kiki was a distant second to andre in his tepid support of their black sheep of a young brother.
he wore his customary all black, his dark eyes hidden behind dark shades.
he wore all black, though he was dressed more simply than she'd seen him, in dark jeans and a black long-sleeved t-shirt and heavy boots.
there were wide eighteenth- century ball gowns, women in little black dresses, one in a fifties poodle skirt, and several in dark dresses with ornate brocade on the bodice, like that of wealthy middle age royalty.
his black gaze was still visible in the dark living room.
another wild adventure by the black sheep of a sister that was dear hannah's.
rhyn emerged from the shadows near the window, dressed in black with his hair tied back.
suddenly, a massive black jaguar leapt past her toward the nearest trail.
she turned and raised an eyebrow at him, her rainbow eyes flashing with every color between white and black.
dressed all in black with his dark eyes and hair, he looked like a living shadow in the snow-covered world.
it was not all black but had a white patch around one eye.
the room consisted of a massive bed with black bedding and white pillows, a wardrobe and trunks, and yawning windows to the sky that light never touched.
and don't try to tell me that black cat wasn't you!
far across the sea, he saw the black walls of hell stretching from water to sky.
he gazed into the black flames of the fire in the hearth.
he trotted down a set of black lacquered stairs, an ipad tucked under one arm.
he didn.t stay to hear the splash this time but walked through the shadow world toward the only portal that glowed black, the portal to hell.
a massive creature with black fur and fangs paused in front of the open door, sniffing the air.
the door exploded open in flames, wood, and black fur.
she.d never understand a man like kris, who saw the world only in black and white!
the black fortress and dark skies made her heart drop to her feet.
the demon was too surprised to react, and jade hacked him down until the black walls were sprayed with demon blood.
he reached into his pocket and withdrew a small black pouch, pouring its contents—two green gems holding the dust of human souls—into his palm.
she relaxed into the comfortable black desk chair in front of her computer, wondering if romas had told evelyn of the half a dozen kids he expected.
all she had to do was choose the color she wanted to wear-- black for the past several days in silent objection to her presence aboard the ship-- and the ship's computer wove it for her.
i see you're not wearing black today.
to them, she was an exotic little doll with her huge, gem-hued eyes, black hair, and toned hour-glass shape.
she interacted daily with the warrior members of her husband's family, but she'd never seen one quite like this, with soulful, ancient intelligence in his black gaze and a predatory walk.
the man a'ran fought was more than a foot taller, with light skin and black hair resembling one of the observers.
crashing into the planet left the left side of her torso black and bruised.
she touched her bruised cheekbone and realized doing so exposed her black and blue arm.
the warm sun had eaten most of the snow from the roadway, leaving a contrasting black ribbon, in places still snow-patched from last night's covering.
"the number six and nine lifts service most of the double black diamond runs," dean said to fred with a smile as the old man glided to a wide stop.
the black diamond expert trails were for the donald rylands of the world.
yes, but think of the sleigh bells and the sound of the train coming in from ridgway, clanking and hooting, and billowing its black smoke.
take off the rose colored glasses—'my sins will continue'—or better yet, wait until you decipher a few more pages and she gives it to you in black and white, chapter and verse and supplies the sinful details.
piano george said they lost two fine black horses that slipped on the ice of the sneffles road and i could hear the men talking loudly about it.
it was barely evening but the darkening clouds and winter season begrimed the outside as black as a slum landlord's heart.
miss annie's pretty much spelled it out in black and white in this here journal, even if it was in code.
ryland sported a black eye but, in spite of it, was smiling.
the pen has black ink in it now.
the last memory each held involved a man with eyes piercing and black as the night sky.
jackson recognized the black eyes as soon as they were leveled upon him.
his black hair appeared darker, thicker and shone as if coated in oil.
he wore black jeans, a dark gray versace silk sport shirt with the cuffs rolled up, and a pair of a. testoni loafers.
claudia chose a black valentino.
they were a soft, sable brown with specs of black that seemed to swirl in motion around her pupils like two tiny solar systems.
connor asked, "white or black?"
right, black it is.
her fur was lustrous and her nose looked like black velvet.
her eyes pierced through him, black as coal; all traces of warmth extinguished.
on the second ring, something sharp pierced the back of her neck and everything went black.
i wish you'd get out of this black mood you've been in lately.
the engine turned over and backfired, black smoke frothing out of the tail pipe.
his black curly hair was cut short, every hair in place, and his angular jaws were freshly shaven.
those pans are all black on the bottom and...
and then everything went black again.
the narrow black highway ribboned smoothly down hill under a canopy of trees.
her gaze dropped to the driver's seat, where a small black military radio sat where none had been when she left the car.
the muscular woman, with short blond hair and clad in black tactical gear, stood in a stark white hallway.
george, i have a small black box about the size of your hand with nothing but a keypad in it.
he opened it and looked at the small black keypad a quarter the size of his palm.
she'd removed her personal identifiers, hacked into the government's tracking mainframe to deactivate the implant in her brain, and changed into the black tactical uniform elise brought her over her civilian grays.
"you don't look like a spec ops soldier," he said, referring to the black uniform elise insisted she wear.
he took each side of her collar and pulled, the effortless movement ripping the black uniform down the middle.
the man before her snatched one arm and flipped out a knife, cutting through her black clothing and tossing it aside.
her black uniform was clean and waiting for her.
soon after, the men in black mowed down two of dan's men, and the three of them were left to fend for themselves.
they were going into the black water, hundreds of feet beneath them.
the occupant of the large chair in the corner of the living room launched towards her in a flurry of brown and black fur.
tim stood in his black fed uniform, comfortable with the soldiers eyeing him.
several soldiers—two in grays and three in black uniforms—approached the bonfire, speaking with the men gathered in a group on one side.
two soldiers—one in black and one in gray—approached.
"welcome," the man in black said at last.
he was more intrigued by the sight of soldiers in pmf grays as well as those in the regular military's black uniforms.
more soldiers in gray and black made their way down the bonfires, pausing to talk to mike.
mike stopped finally in a chamber where two soldiers—one in black and one in gray—were dusting themselves off.
"at first, i think it was knowing he was a black sheep like me.  my sister always treated me like i was a blight on the family name.  she tried to help me in her own way, i guess, which was better than what rhyn's brothers did to him.  i wanted to believe he could make it in the immortal world, because if he could, i could, too," she started.
an hour glass with streaming black sand appeared in his palm.
rhyn crept carefully through the demon scouts positioned throughout the forest surrounding the castle.  the demons wore the dark one's uniform of all black with waterproof cloaks and hoods.  the demon side of him rendered his presence similar enough to a full-demon's that the others wouldn't be alarmed.  he sized up each demon he passed, until he found one who appeared to be his size.  the creature didn't hear his soft step, and the snapping of the demon's neck was the only other sound in the falling rain.
the water looked … black in the moonlight.  she took a step back and looked up towards the moons.  as gabriel indicated, one moon was lower than the other.
the sounds of fighting grew faint and then disappeared.  the stream wound through the jungle until it reached a small waterfall that fed into a massive lake whose black surface reflected the stars and moon.  katie slid down the hill beside the waterfall to the lake's edge, uncertain what to do.  gabriel hadn't mentioned the stream ending or the lake.
rhyn opened a portal and walked through the cool shadow place.  the shadow world felt … strange this time.  he looked around, unsettled by the sensation that someone else was there.  the black portal to hell throbbed then dimmed, as if someone and come through.
toby huddled against the black stone wall of his cell in hell.
rhyn awoke from the island dreamscape in the shadow world.  he rose, uncertain what happened but recalling his urgency.  he crossed through the glowing black portal into the one place he'd hoped never to see again: hell.  unwilling to get stuck in the cell where he'd spent many lifetimes, he chose to open the portal into the office of the council's betrayer, sasha.  the office was as he remembered it, down to the black flames in the hearth.
yes. and the man in black who used to visit you.
"i'm not sure.  i was at home when someone broke in.  i heard someone screaming then something hot went straight through me.  everything went black, and i woke up here," the woman explained.
more thunder boomed.  katie wondered what other kinds of storms the underworld might have.  would it rain something other than black water?  with her luck, it'd rain bugs, like the beetle nest she skirted.
kris looked up in time to see kiki crash through the canopy and plummet towards the ground.  kris gasped and sprung forward.  a streak of black crossed his vision as a flying demon snatched kiki out of the air.

quantity of lime being increased at to exceed the sulphur, however.
they are neutral to litmus and do not combine with dilute acids or bases; strong bases, such as lime and baryta, yield saccharates, whilst, under certain conditions, acids and acid anhydrides may yield esters.

like glucose it gives saccharates with lime, baryta and strontia.
as cold juice has a greater affinity for lime than hot juice, it is best to treat the juice with lime when cold.
the requisite amount of milk of lime set up at to° beaume is then added.
cream of lime of 17° beaume is sometimes used, but the weaker solution is preferable, since the proper proportion is more easily adjusted.
these results are brought about by adding to the cold juice as it comes from the mill the proper proportion of milk of lime set up at 8° b., and then delivering the limed juice in a constant steady stream as near the bottom of the defecator as possible; it is thus brought into immediate contact with the heating surface and heated once for all before it ascends, with the result of avoiding the disturbance caused in the ordinary defecator by pouring cold juice from above on to the surface of the heated juice, and so establishing down-currents of cold juice and up-currents of hot juice.
to make this apparatus more perfectly automatic, an arrangement for continually adding to and mixing with the juice the proper proportion of milk of lime has been adapted to it; and although it may be objected that once the proportion has been determined no allowance is made for the variation in the quality of the juice coming from the mill owing to the variations that may occur in the canes fed into the mills, it is obviously as easy to vary the proportion with the automatic arrangement from time to time as it is to vary in each separate direction, if the man in charge will take the trouble to do so, which he very seldom does with the ordinary defecators, satisfying himself with testing the juice once or twice in a watch.
in diffusion plants the milk of lime is added, in proper proportion, in the cells of the diffusion battery, and the chips or slices themselves act as a mechanical filter for the juice; while in the sandwich islands coral-sand filters have been employed for some years, in addition to the chips, to free the juice from impurities held in mechanical suspension.
this is a closed vessel, into which carbonic acid gas (produced as described hereafter) is forced, and combining with the lime in the juice forms carbonate of lime.
the whole is then passed through filter presses, the clear juice being run off for further treatment, while the carbonate of lime is obtained in cakes which are taken to the fields as manure.
the juice, which has now become comparatively clear, is again treated with lime, and again passed through a saturator and filter presses, and comes out still clearer than before.
it is then treated with sulphurous acid gas, for the purpose of decolorization, again limed to neutralize the acid, and then passed through a third saturator wherein all traces of lime and sulphur are removed.
a process for purifying and decolorizing the juice expressed from beetroots by the addition of a small quantity of manganate of lime (20 to 50 grammes per hectolitre of juice), under the influence of an electric current, was worked with considerable success in a sugar factory in the department of seine-et-marne in the year 1900-1901.
a saving of 40% is stated to be effected in lime.
if by this process a more perfect defecation and purification of the juice is obtained, it will no doubt be highly beneficial to the cane p lanter, though no great economy in lime can be effected, because but very little is used in a cane factory in comparison with the amount used in a beet factory.
the carbonic acid gas injected into the highly limed juice in the saturators is made by the calcination of limestone in a kiln provided with three cleaning doors, so arranged as to allow the lime to be removed simultaneously from them every six hours.
briefly, sugar-refining consists of melting raw or unrefined sugar with water into a syrup of 27° to 28° beaume, or 1230 specific gravity, passing it through filtering cloth to remove the sand and other matters in mechanical suspension, and then through animal charcoal to remove all traces of colouring matter and lime, thus producing a perfectly clear white syrup, which, cooked in the vacuum pan and crystallized, becomes the refined sugar of commerce.
the syrup in the cistern is allowed to remain for about twelve hours, by which time the char will have absorbed all the colouring matter in it, as well as the lime.
after the sweets have come away, cold water is passed through the char until no trace of lime or sulphate of lime is found in it; then a large manhole at the bottom of the cistern is opened, and the washed and spent char is removed.
lime of exceptionally good quality is burnt to a large extent in the neighbourhood, and forms an important article of trade; it is derived from the lower chalk formation.
it may be obtained from storax by distillation with water, and synthetically by heating cinnamic acid with lime, by the action of aluminium chloride on a mixture of vinyl bromide and benzene, by removing the elements of hydrobromic acid from bromethylbenzene by means of alcoholic potash, or, best, by treating (-bromhydrocinnamic acid with soda, when it yields styrolene, carbon dioxide and hydrobromic acid.
the a-halogen compounds are obtained by heating styrolene chloride (or bromide) with lime or alcoholic potash; they are liquids which have a penetrating odour, and yield acetophenone when heated with water to 180°.
the soils overlying red sandstone rocks would be reddish and of a sandy nature, while those overlying chalk would be whitish and contain considerable amounts of lime.
7,600 „ lime ..
it has long been known that when organic materials such as the dung and urine of animals, or even the bodies of animals and plants, are applied to the soil, the nitrogen within them becomes oxidized, and ultimately appears in the form of nitrate of lime, potash or some other base.
the presence of a base such as lime or magnesia (or their carbonates) is also essential, as well as an adequate degree of moisture: in dry soils nitrification ceases.
it is the business of the farmer and gardener to promote the activity of these organisms by good tillage, careful drainage and occasional application of lime to soils which are deficient in this substance.
carbonate of lime is also a constituent to a greater or lesser extent in almost all soils.
pure carbonate of lime when heated loses 44% of its weight, the decrease being due to the loss of carbon dioxide gas.
the resulting white product is termed calcium oxide lime, burnt lime, quicklime, cob lime, or caustic lime.
this substance absorbs and combines with water very greedily, at the same time becoming very hot, and falling into a fine dry powder,' calcium hydroxide or slaked lime, which when left in the open slowly combines with the carbon dioxide of the air and becomes calcium carbonate, from which we began.
when recommendations are made about liming land it is necessary to indicate more precisely than is usually done which of the three classes of material named above - chalk, quicklime or slaked lime - is intended.
generally speaking the oxide or quicklime has a more rapid and greater effect in modifying the soil than slaked lime, and this again greater than the carbonate or chalk.
lime in whatever form it is applied has a many-sided influence in the fertility of the land.
the addition of small quantities of lime, especially in a caustic form, to stiff greasy clays makes them much more porous and pliable.
a lump of clay, which if dried would become hard and intractable, crumbles into pieces when dried after adding to it 2% of lime.
the lime causes the minute separate particles of clay to flocculate or group themselves together into larger compound grains between which air and water can percolate more freely.
it is this power of creating a more crumbly tilth on stiff clays that makes lime so valuable to the farmer.
lime also assists in the decomposition of the organic matter or humus in the soil and promotes nitrification; hence it is of great value after green manuring or where the land contains much humus from the addition of bulky manures such as farm-yard dung.
this tendency to destroy organic matter makes the repeated application of lime a pernicious practice, especially on land which contains little humus to begin with.
although good crops may follow the application of lime, the latter is not a direct fertilizer or manure and is no substitute for such.
lime is a base and neutralizes the acid materials present in badly drained meadows and boggy pastures.
land which contains less than about z /c, of lime usually needs the addition of this material.
the particular form in which lime should be applied for the best results depends upon the nature of the soil.
in practice the proximity to chalk pits or lime kilns, the cost of the lime and cartage, will determine which is most economical.
it contains a certain amount of unaltered caustic lime and slacked lime, along with sulphates and sulphides of lime, some of which have an evil odour.
s i milarly soils can be improved by applying to them marl, a substance consisting of a mixture of clay with variable proportions of lime.
some of the chalk marls, which are usually of a yellowish or dirty grey colour, contain clay and 50 to 80% of carbonate of lime with a certain proportion of phosphate of lime.
such a material would not only have an influence on the texture of the land but the lime would reduce the sourness of the land and the phosphate of lime supply one of the most valuable of plant foodconstituents.
typical clay-marls are tenacious, soapy clays of yellowish-red or brownish colour and generally contain less than 50% of lime.
even stiff soils deficient in lime are greatly improved in fertility by the addition of marls.
the demand for saltpetre as an ingredient of gunpowder led to the formation of saltpetre plantations or nitriaries, which at one time were common in france, germany, and other countries; the natural conditions were simulated by exposing heaps of decaying organic matter mixed with alkalies (lime, &c.) to atmospheric action.
wall-saltpetre or lime saltpetre, calcium nitrate, ca(n03)2, is found as an efflorescence on the walls of stables; it is now manufactured in large quantities by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, i.e.
by passing a powerful electric arc discharge through moist air and absorbing the nitric acid formed by lime.
rejecting the old notion that plants derive their nourishment from humus, he taught that they get carbon and nitrogen from the carbon dioxide and ammonia present in the atmosphere, these compounds being returned by them to the atmosphere by the processes of putrefaction and fermentation - which latter he regarded as essentially chemical in nature - while their potash, soda, lime, sulphur, phosphorus, &c., come from the soil.

it may be prepared by the fusion of para-toluene sulphonic acid with potash; by the action of nitrous acid on para-toluidine; or by heating para-oxyphenyl acetic acid with lime.
the furnace used by henri moissan in his experiments on reactions at high temperatures, on the fusion and volatilization of refractory materials, and on the formation of carbides, suicides and borides of various metals, consisted, in its simplest form, of two superposed blocks of lime or of limestone with a central cavity cut in the lower block, and with a corresponding but much shallower inverted cavity in the upper block, which thus formed the lid of the furnace.
alumina and lime, for example, which cannot be reduced at ordinary furnace temperatures, readily give up their oxygen to carbon in the electric furnace, and then combine with an excess of carbon to form metallic carbides.
8 a in the cavity of the lime blocks.
when prolonged heating is required at very high temperatures it is found necessary to line the furnace-cavity with alternate layers of magnesia and carbon, taking care that the lamina next to the lime is of magnesia; if this were not done the lime in contact with the carbon crucible would form calcium carbide and would slag down, but magnesia does not yield a carbide in this way.
in starting the furnace, the bottom is prepared by ramming it with charcoal-powder that has been soaked in milk of lime and dried, so that each particle is coated with a film of lime, which serves to reduce the loss of current by conduction through the lining when the furnace becomes hot.

clearer evidence of their occurrence has, however, been found in fragments of wood fossilized by silica or carbonate of lime which are sometimes met with in coal seams.
before the commercial production of calcium carbide made it one of the most easily obtainable gases, the processes which were most largely adopted for its preparation in laboratories were: - first, the decomposition of ethylene bromide by dropping it slowly into a boiling solution of alcoholic potash, and purifying the evolved gas from the volatile bromethylene by washing it through a second flask containing a boiling solution of alcoholic potash, or by passing it over moderately heated soda lime; and, second, the more ordinarily adopted process of passing the products of incomplete combustion from a bunsen burner, the flame of which had struck back, through an ammoniacal solution of cuprous chloride, when the red copper acetylide was produced.
wohler first made calcium carbide, and found that water decomposed it into lime and acetylene.

compounds embraced by the second definition are more usually termed hydroxides, since at one time they were regarded as combinations of an oxide with water, for example, calcium oxide or lime when slaked with water yielded calcium hydroxide, written formerly as cao h 2 o.
the matrix is the lime or cement, whose chemical action with the added water causes the concrete to solidify; and the aggregate is the broken stone or hard material which is embedded in the matrix.
the oldest of all the matrices is lime, and many splendid examples of its use by the romans still exist.
it has been to a great extent superseded by portland cement, on account of the much greater strength of the latter, though lime concrete is still used in many places for dry foundations and small structures.
to be of service the lime should be what is known as "hydraulic," that is, not pure or "fat," but containing some argillaceous matter, and should be carefully slaked with water before being mixed with the aggregate.
to ensure this being properly done, the lumps of lime should be broken up small, and enough water to slake them should be added, the lime then being allowed to rest for about forty-eight hours, when the water changes the particles of quicklime to hydrate of lime, and breaks up the hard lumps into a powder.
the hydrated lime, after being passed through a fine screen to sort out any lumps unaffected by the water, is ready for concrete making, and if not required at once should be stored in a dry place.
when lime is used as a matrix, certain natural earths such as pozzuolana or trass, or, failing these, powdered bricks or tiles, may be used instead of sand with great advantage.
they have the property of entering into chemical combination with the lime, forming a hard setting compound, and increasing the hardness of the resulting concrete.
in proportioning the quantities of matrix to aggregate the ideal to be aimed at is to get a concrete in which the voids or air-spaces shall be as small as possible; and as the lime or cement is usually by far the most expensive item, it is desir able to use as little of it as is consistent with strength.
when natural flint gravel containing both stones and sand is used, it is usual to mix so much gravel with so much lime or cement.
in hand mixing it is usual to measure out from gauge boxes the sand, stones and cement or lime in a heap on a wooden platform.
for lime concrete, and 1 to 5 cwt.
the same praise cannot, however, be given to lime concrete.
even though the best hydraulic lime be used it is wise to confine it to places where it is not exposed to the air, or to running water, and indeed for important structures the use of lime should be avoided.
good portland cement is so much stronger than any lime that there are few situations where it is not cheaper as well as better to use the former, because, although cement is the more expensive matrix, a smaller proportion of it will suffice for use.
lime should never be used in work exposed to sea-water, or to water containing chemicals of any kind.
the matter was carefully investigated, and it was found that the sulphate of magnesia in the sea-water has a decomposing action on portland cements, especially those which contain a large proportion of lime or even of alumina.
but to ensure the permanence of structures in sea-water the great object is to choose a cement containing as little lime and alumina as possible, and free from sulphates such as gypsum; and more important still to proportion the sand and stones in the concrete in such a way that the structure is practically non-porous.
others, like ford's silicate of limestone, are practically lime mortars of excellent quality, which can be carved and cut like a sandstone of fine quality.
boundary of the park there is a group of about 70 active springs, known as the mammoth hot springs, which hold carbonate of lime in solution.
natural soils consist of substances derived from the decomposition of various kinds of rocks, the bulk consisting of clay, silica and lime, in various proportions.
argillaceous or clay soils are those which contain a large percentage (45-50) of clay, and a small percentage (5 or less) of lime.
loamy soils contain a considerable quantity (30-45%) of clay, and smaller quantities of lime, humus and sand.
manly soils are those which contain a considerable percentage (10-20) of lime, and are called clay marls, loamy marls and sandy marls, according as these several ingredients preponderate.
calcareous soils, which may also be heavy, intermediate or light, are those which contain more than 20% of lime, their fertility depending on the proportions of clay and sand which enter into their composition; they are generally cold and wet.
the chief point to be borne in mind in making these mixtures is not to combine in the same compost any bodies that are antagonistic in their nature, as for example lime and ammonia.
in a natural state it is obtained from bones, guano and wood ashes; and in an artificial condition from basic slag or thomas's phosphate, coprolites and superphosphate of lime.
lime in the caustic state is beneficially applied to soils which contain an excess of inert vegetable matter, and hence may be used for the improvement of old garden soils saturated with humus, or of peaty soils not thoroughly reclaimed.

gas lime, after it has been exposed to the air for a few months is an excellent manure on heavy soils.
at this season roses, grape vines and other plants are often affected by mildew; an effectual remedy is to paint the hot-water pipes with a mixture of sulphur and lime, put on as thick as ordinary whitewash, once each week until it is checked; but care must be taken not to apply it on any surface at a higher temperature than 212°.
in the carboniferous limestone series, the purer kinds of limestone are used for the manufacture of lime, bleaching powder and similar products, also as a flux in the smelting of iron; some of the less pure varieties are used in making cement.
thomas, who showed that, in the presence of a slag rich in lime, the whole of the phosphorus could be removed readily.
impurities.-the properties of iron and steel, like those of most of the metals, are profoundly influenced by the presence of small and sometimes extremely small quantities of certain impurities, of which the most important are phosphorus and sulphur, the former derived chiefly from apatite (phosphate of lime) and other minerals which accompany the iron ore itself, the latter from the pyrite found not only in most iron ores but in nearly all coal and coke.
drops of slag props of iron layer of molten slag- -- --:€___ layer of molten iron--- * the ore and lime actually exist here in powder.
lime of the limestone and the ash of the fuel to form a complex molten silicate called the " cinder " or " slag."
of lron ore lumps of lime - in the upper part of the furnace the carbonic oxide deoxidizes the iron oxide of the ore by such reactions as xco+fe02.
7) the solid matter has become so hot that the now deoxidized iron melts, as does the slag as fast as it is formed by the union of its three constituents, the gangue, the lime resulting from the decomposition of the limestone and the ash of the fuel.
the desulphurizing effect of this transfer of the sulphur from union with iron to union with calcium is due to the fact that, whereas iron sulphide dissolves readily in the molten metallic iron, calcium;sulphide, in the presence of a slag rich in lime, does not, but by preference enters the slag, which may thus absorb even as much as 3% of sulphur.
the duty of the limestone (caco 3) is to furnish enough lime to form with the gangue of the ore and the ash of the fuel a lime silicate or slag of such a composition  that it will melt at the temperature which it reaches at about level a, of fig.
7,  that it will be fluid enough to run out through the cinder notch, and  that it will be rich enough in lime to supply that needed for the desulphurizing reaction fes+ cao+c = fe+cas+co.
in order that the slag shall have these properties its composition usually lies between the following limits: silica, 26 to 35%; lime, plus i 4 times the magnesia, 45 to 55%; alumina, 5 to 20%.
of these the silica and alumina are chiefly those which the gangue of the ore and the ash of the fuel introduce, whereas the lime is that added intentionally to form with these others a slag of the needed physical properties.
the poorer it is in iron, the more limestone must in general be added, and hence the more slag results, though of course an ore the gangue of which initially contains much lime and little silica needs a much smaller addition of limestone than one of which the gangue is chiefly silica.
in the basic bessemer process, also, unforeseen variations in the siliconcontent are harmful, because the quantity of lime added should be just that needed to neutralize the resultant silica and the phosphoric acid and no more.
of these the first escapes immediately as a gas, and the others unite with iron oxide, lime, or other strong base present to form a molten silicate or silica-phosphate called " cinder " or " slag," which floats on the molten or pasty metal.
lime to it.
in the basic bessemer process phosphorus is readily removed by oxidation, because the product of its oxidation, phosphoric acid, p 2 o 5, in the presence of an excess of base forms stable phosphates of lime and iron which pass into the slag, making it valuable as an artificial manure.
the basic or dephosphorizing variety of the bessemer process, called in germany the " thomas " process, differs from the acid process in four chief points: (i) that its slag is made very basic and hence dephosphorizing by adding much lime to it;  that the lining is basic, because an acid lining would quickly be destroyed by such a basic slag;  that the process is arrested not at the " drop of the flame " (§85) but at a predetermined length of time after it; and  that phosphorus instead of silicon is the chief source of heat.
the slag, in order that it may have such an excess of base that this will retain the phosphoric acid as fast as it is formed by the oxidation of the phosphorus of the pig iron, and prevent it from being re-deoxidized and re-absorbed by the iron, should, according to von ehrenwerth's rule which is generally followed, contain enough lime to form approximately a tetra-calcic silicate, 4cao,s10 2 with the silica which results from the oxidation of the silicon of the pig iron and tri-calcic phosphate, 3cao,p205, with the phosphoric acid which forms. the danger of this " rephosphorization " is greatest at the end of the blow, when the recarburizing additions are made.
this lime is charged in the form of common quicklime, cao, resulting from the calcination of a pure limestone, caco 3, which should be as free as possible from silica.
the usual composition of this slag is iron oxide, i o to 16%; lime, 40 to 50%; magnesia, 5%; silica, 6 to 9%; phosphoric acid, 16 to 20%.
the lining of the converter is made of 90% of the mixture of lime and magnesia which results from calcining dolomite, (ca,mg)co i, at a very high temperature, and 10% of coal tar freed from its water by heating.
the removal of the greater part of the phosphorus takes place after the carbon has been oxidized and the flame has consequently " dropped," probably because the lime, which is charged in solid lumps, is taken up by the slag so slowly that not until late in the operation does the slag become so basic as to be retentive of phosphoric acid.
- silicon cannot here be used as the chief source of heat as it is in the acid bessemer process, because most of the heat which its oxidation generates is consumed in heating the great quantities of lime needed for neutralizing the resultant silica.
at the carnegie works mr monell gets the two dephosphorizing conditions, low temperature and basicity of slag, early in the process, by pouring his molten but relatively cool cast iron upon a layer of pre-heated lime and iron oxide on the bottom of the open-hearth furnace.
the lime and iron oxide melt, and, in passing up through the overlying metal, the iron oxide very rapidly oxidizes its phosphorus and thus drags it into the slag as phosphoric acid.
in the first stage the phosphorus is removed from the molten steel by oxidizing it to phosphoric acid, p205, by means of iron oxide contained in a molten slag very rich in lime, and hence very basic and retentive of that phosphoric acid.
this slag is formed by melting lime and iron oxide, with a little silica sand if need be.
floating on top of the molten metal, it rapidly oxidizes its phosphorus, and the resultant phosphoric acid combines with the lime in the overlying slag as phosphate of lime.
next the metal is covered with a very basic slag, made by melting lime with a little silica and fluor spar.
coke now charged into this slag first deoxidizes any iron oxide contained in either slag or metal, and next deoxidizes part of the lime of the slag and thus forms calcium, which, uniting with the sulphur present in the molten metal, forms calcium sulphide, cao+fes-}-c=cas+fe+co.
we still use the old familiar purifying agents, iron oxide, lime and nascent calcium.
at the same time, hot springs, containing abundant carbonate of lime in solution, produced deposits of travertine at various points.
limestone appears in various places, and in the north-east a light grey marble is quarried for lime.
the substances in commonest use are: - lime or limestone, to slag off silica and silicates, fluor-spar for lead, calcium and barium sulphates and calcium phosphate, and silica for removing basic substances such as limestone.
the mineral products of the district also include lignite, copper, manganese, vitriol, lime, gypsum, volcanic stones (used for millstones) and slates.
these plateaus, with an average elevation of boo to 1000 ft., are mostly covered with forests of oak, beech and lime, and are deeply cut by river valleys, some being narrow and craggy, and others broad, with gentle slopes and marshy bottoms. narrow ravines intersect them in all directions, and they often assume, especially in the east, the character of wild, impassable, woody and marshy tracts.
the lime appears in groves only in the east (memel, pripet, lublin).
south-east of asuncion), and native copper, oxide of manganese, marbles, lime and salt have been found, the real wealth of the country consists rather in the variety and value of its vegetable products.

sometimes, to get rid of these impurities, the brine is treated in a large tub-`(bessoir) with lime; on settling it becomes clear and colourless, but the dissolved lime forms a skin on its surface in the pan, retards the evaporation and impedes the crystallization.
in a volvox sphere, for with lime like corallina among red algae.
some species belonging to the families squamariaceae and corallinaceae grow attached through their whole length and breadth, and are often encrusted with lime.
excepting where the thallus is impregnated with silica, as in diatomaceae, or carbonate of lime, as in corallinaceae,characeae and some siphonales, it is perhaps not surprising that algae should not have been extensively preserved in the fossil form.
were hydraulic; it was also known that this property could be conferred on ordinary lime by admixture of silicious materials such as pozzuolana or t.ufa.
heated in a kiln until its carbonic acid has been driven off, it yields pure lime.
this slakes violently with water, giving slaked lime, which can be made into a smooth paste with water and mixed with sand to form common mortar.
the setting of the mortar is due to the drying of the lime (a purely physical phenomenon, no chemical action occurring between the lime and the sand).
subsequent hardening of the mortar is caused by the gradual absorption of carbonic acid from the air by the lime, a skin of carbonate of lime being formed; but the action is superficial.
mortar made from pure or "fat" lime cannot withstand the action of water, and is only used for work done above water-level.
if, however, such "fat" lime is mixed in the presence of water, not with sand but with silica in an active form, i.e.
amorphous and (generally) hydrated, or with a silicate containing silica in an active condition, it will unite with the silica and form a silicate of lime capable of resisting the action of water.
the mixture of the lime and active silica or silicate is a pozzuolanic cement.
the simplest of all pozzuolanic cements would be a mixture of pure lime and hydrated silica, but though the latter is prepared artificially for various purposes, it is too expensive to be used as a cement material.
the slag, which must contain a high percentage of lime, is granulated by being run while fused into abundance of water.
this potential energy becomes kinetic when the slag is brought into contact with lime in the presence of water, and causes the formation of a true hydraulic silicate of lime.
the following analysis shows the composition of a typical slag: 99.20 granulated slag of this character is ground with slaked lime until both materials are in a state of fine division and intimately mixed.
the usual proportions are three of slag to one of slaked lime by weight.
they are not usually manufactured by the careful grinding together of the pozzuolana and the lime, but are mixed roughly, a great excess of pozzuolana being employed.
this excess does no harm, for that part which fails to unite with the lime serves as a diluent, much as does sand in mortar.
good hydraulic mortars may be made from lime mixed with furnace ashes or burnt clay as the pozzuolanic constituent.
cements of the portland type differ in kind from those of the pozzuolanic class; they are not mechanical mixtures of lime and active silica ready to unite under suitable conditions, but consist of definite chemical compounds of lime and silica and lime and alumina, which, when mixed with water, combine therewith, forming crystalline substances of great mechanical strength, and capable of adhering firmly to clean inert material, such as stone and sand.
the commonest of such substances in england are chalk and clay, but where local conditions demand it, limestone, marl, shale, slag or any similar material may be used, provided that the correct proportions of lime, silica and alumina are maintained.
next in antiquity to hydraulic lime is roman cement, prepared by heating an indurated marl occurring naturally in nodules.
true, it is possible to manufacture portland cement from portland stone (after adding a suitable quantity of clay), but this is merely because portland stone is substantially carbonate of lime; any other limestone would serve equally well.
although portland cement is later in date than either roman cement or hydraulic lime, yet on account of its greater industrial importance, and of the fact that, being an artificial product, it is of approximately uniform composition and properties, it may conveniently be treated of first.
the kilns commonly employed are "chamber kilns," circular structures not unlike an ordinary running lime kiln, but having the top closed and connected at the side with a wide flue in which the slurry is exposed to the hot products of combustion from the kiln.
a possible alternative is to burn the limestone first and mix the resulting lime with clay, the mixture being burned as before.
as it descends it reaches a part of the kiln where the temperature is higher; here the carbonic acid of the carbonate of lime, and the combined water of the clay are driven off, and the resulting lime begins to act chemically on the dehydrated clay.
the burner where the temperature is highest, and is there heated so highly that the union of the lime, silica and alumina is complete, and fully burnt clinker falls out of the kiln.
this material must be picked out, as such underburnt stuff contains free lime or unsaturated lime compounds.
thus the silica may range from 19 to 27%, the alumina and ferric oxide jointly from 7 to 14%, the lime from 60 to 67%.
all such variations are permissible provided that the quantity of silica and alumina is sufficient to saturate the whole of the lime and to leave none of it in a "free" condition, likely to cause the cement to expand after setting.
other things being equal, the higher the percentage of lime within the limits indicated above the stronger is the cement, but such highly limed cement is less easy to burn than cement containing about 62% of lime; and unless the burning is thorough and the raw materials are intimately mixed, the cement is apt to be unsound.
the function of the ferric oxide present in ordinary cement is little more than that of a flux to aid the union of silica, alumina and lime in the clinker; its role in the setting of the cement is altogether secondary.
it will be observed that in the hydration of tricalcium silicate, the main constituent of portland cement, a large portion of the lime appears as calcium hydroxide, i.e.
slaked lime.
hydraulic lime is a cement of the portland as distinct from the pozzuolanic class.
the most typical hydraulic lime is that known as chaux du theil, made from a limestone found at ardeche in france.
it contains but little alumina and oxide of iron, which are the constituents generally necessary to bring about the union of silica and lime to form a cement, but in spite of this the silica is so finely divided and so well distributed that it unites readily with the lime when the limestone is burned at a sufficiently high temperature.
analyses of the two classes of hydraulic lime are as follows: hydraulic lime contains a good deal of uncombined lime, and has to be slaked before it is used as a cement.
in france this slaking is conducted systematically by the makers, the freshly burned lime being sprinkled with water and stored in large bins where slaking proceeds slowly and regularly until the whole of the surplus uncom bined lime is slaked and rendered harmless, while the cementitious compounds, notably tricalcium silicate, remain untouched.
in english practice hydraulic lime is slaked by the user.
the product may then be regarded as a cement of the portland class mixed with slaked lime.
the structure is free to take its permanent position before the lime sets, and cracks are thus avoided.
a case in point is the employment of hydraulic lime in place of portland cement as grouting outside the cast-iron tubes used for lining tunnels made by the shield system.
the term natural cements is applied to cements made by burning mixtures of clay and carbonate of lime naturally occurring in approximately suitable proportions.
ordinary mortar failed in such positions; mortar made from lime prepared from limestones or chalks containing a little clay was found to stand; mortar made from lime mixed with trass or similar active silicious material was also found to stand.
in this case the action of the water is checked by the film of carbonate of lime which eventually forms on the surface of calcareous cement.
the inhabitants of denbigh are chiefly occupied in the timber trade, butter-making, poultry-farming, bootmaking, tanning and quarrying (lime, slate and paving-stones).
in the lowlands, on the other hand, rich stores of coal, iron, lime and other minerals have been found.
it is made commercially by boiling benzotrichloride (obtained from toluene) with milk of lime, the calcium benzoate so obtained being then decomposed by hydrochloric acid 2c 6 h 5 cc1 3 +4ca(oh) 2 = (c6h6000)2ca-1-3cac12+4h20.

wahl [german patent 70773 (1893)] prepare a 97% manganese from pyrolusite by heating it with 30% sulphuric acid, the product being then converted into manganous oxide by heating in a current of reducing gas at a dull red heat, cooled in a reducing atmosphere, and finally reduced by heating with granulated aluminium in a magnesia crucible with lime and fluorspar as a flux.
the metals, which by combination with oxygen became oxides, were antimony, silver, arsenic, bismuth, cobalt, copper, tin, iron, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, gold, platinum, lead, tungsten and zinc; and the "simple earthy salifiable substances" were lime, baryta, magnesia, alumina and silica.
coal, lime and building stone are abundant in the neighbourhood.
the play of colour is exquisite, the basalt combining every tint of warm red, brown and rich maroon; sea-weeds and lichens paint the cave green and gold; while the lime that has filtered through has crusted the pillars here and there a pure snow-white.
fizeau he carried on a series of investigations on the intensity of the light of the sun, as compared with that of carbon in the electric arc, and of lime in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe; on the interference of heat rays, and of light rays differing greatly in lengths of path; and on the chromatic polarization of light.
the dried nutmegs are then rubbed over with dry sifted lime.
the process of liming, which originated at the time when the dutch held a monopoly of the trade, was with the view of preventing the germination of the seeds, which were formerly immersed for three months in milk of lime for this purpose, and a preference is still manifested in some countries for nutmegs so prepared.
as they approached they threw unslaked lime in the air and the wind blew it in the faces of the french.
this liquor is first treated with carbonate of lime (ground chalk or limestone) in a " neutralizing-well," made of acid-proof material and provided with wooden stirring-gear.
the mud thus formed is settled out, and the clear liquor, which is now quite neutral and contains both manganese and calcium chlorides, is mixed with cream of lime and treated by a strong current of air, produced by a blowing-engine.
the first action of the lime is to convert the manganese chloride into manganous hydrate (mn(oh) 2) and calcium chloride; then more lime is added which greatly promotes and hastens the oxidizing process.
the object of the latter is to convert the manganous hydroxide by the atmospheric oxygen into manganese dioxide, but this would take place much too slowly if there was not an excess of lime present ready to combine with the manganese dioxide to form a calcium manganite.
only so much lime is used that an acid manganite is formed corresponding to one molecule of calcium oxide to two of manganous oxide.
this additional lime, which is called the " basis," certainly takes up hydrochloric acid in the next stage of the process, but that causes no more waste of acid than the incomplete action on native manganese ore, mentioned before.
as the gas issuing from these contains only about 5 volumes% of hydrochloric acid, it cannot be made to act upon lime in the ordinary bleaching-powder chambers, but specially constructed chambers must be provided (see fig.
bleaching-powder is a compound obtained by the action of free chlorine on hydrated lime, containing a slight excess of water at ordinary temperatures or slightly above these.
it always contains a certain quantity of chemically combined water and also an excess of lime.
usually this lime is regarded only as mechanically mixed with the bleaching-compound, caocl 2, but some chemists adopt formulae in which this lime is equally represented.
for the manufacture of bleaching-powder, limestone of high degree of purity (especially free from magnesia and iron) is carefully burned so as to drive out nearly all the carbon dioxide without overheating the lime.
about sixteen such chambers were combined in such manner that the fresh gas passed into that chamber which had been the longest time at work and in which the bleaching-powder was nearly finished, and so forth until the gas, now all but entirely exhausted, reached the last-filled chamber in which it met with fresh lime and there gave up the last of the chlorine.
the fresh lime is continually charged into the top cylinder, is gradually moved towards the other end, falls down into the next lower cylinder and thus gradually makes its way to the lowest cylinder.
if the chlorine is made to act on cream of lime, care being taken that the temperature does not rise above 35° and that the chlorine is not in excess, a solution is obtained containing a mixture of calcium chloride and hypochlorite which is a very convenient agent for bleachers, but which does not bear the expense of carriage over long distances.
- formerly all chlorate of potash, as some is still, was obtained by passing chlorine into milk of lime, allowing the temperature to rise almost to the boiling-point, and continuing until the bleaching-solution, originally formed, is converted into a mixture of calcium chlorate and chloride, the final reaction being 6ca(oh)2+6c12=5cac12+ca(c103)2+6h20.
this carbon monoxide is formed by the action of coal on the lime, formed at this stage from the original limestone.
this is always made from the carbonate by the action of slaked lime: na 2 co 3 +ca(oh) 2 = cac03+2naoh.
some heat is also gained by the slaking of the caustic lime within the liquor.
they are made by dissolving ordinary soda-ash in hot water, adding a small quantity of chloride of lime for the destruction of colouring matter and the oxidation of any ferrous salts present, carefully settling the solution, without allowing its temperature to fall below the point of maximum solubility (34° c.), and running the clarified liquid into cast-iron crystallizers or " cones," where, on cooling down, most of the sodium carbonate is separated in large crystals of the decahydrated form.
the ammonium carbonates are driven out from their solutions by mere prolonged boiling, being thereby decomposed into ammonia, carbon dioxide and water, but the ammonium chloride is not volatile under these conditions, and must be decomposed by milk of lime: 2nh 4 c1+ca(oh) 2 = 2nh 3 +cac1 2 +2h 2 0.
the milk of lime is introduced at a certain distance from the bottom.
the steam causes the action of the lime on the ammonium chloride to take place in this lower portion of the still, from which the steam, mixed with all the liberated ammonia, rises into the upper portion of the column where its heat serves to drive out the volatile ammonium carbonate.
the melt is dissolved in water and the dyestuff is liberated from the sodium salt by hydrochloric or sulphuric acid, or is converted into the calcium salt by digestion with hot milk of lime, then filtered and the calcium salt decomposed by acid.
sometimes their homes are mere huts of turf, or of clay tiles, with mortar made from lime and clay or cow-dung.
they have olive presses and flour mills, and their own millstone quarries, even travelling into make lime, tiles, woodwork for the houses, domestic utensils and agricultural implements.
kankar or ghutin (concretionary carbonate of lime) is collected for this purpose from the river-beds and alluvial deposits.
it sometimes contains as much as 7 0% of carbonate of lime; but generally the amount is much less and the fluxing value proportionally diminished.
